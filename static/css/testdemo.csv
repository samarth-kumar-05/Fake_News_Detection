20800,"Specter of Trump Loosens Tongues, if Not Purse Strings, in Silicon Valley - The New York Times",David Streitfeld,"PALO ALTO, Calif.  â€”   After years of scorning the political process, Silicon Valley has leapt into the fray. The prospect of a President Donald J. Trump is pushing the tech community to move beyond its traditional role as donors and to embrace a new existence as agitators and activists. A distinguished venture capital firm emblazoned on its corporate home page an earthy   epithet. One prominent tech chieftain says the consequences of Mr. Trumpâ€™s election would â€œrange between disastrous and terrible. â€ Another compares him to a dictator. And nearly 150 tech leaders signed an open letter decrying Mr. Trump and his campaign of â€œangerâ€ and â€œbigotry. â€ Not quite all the action is  . Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and Palantir who was the first outside investor in Facebook, spoke at the Republican convention in July. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Mr. Thiel is giving $1. 25 million to support Mr. Trumpâ€™s candidacy even as other supporters flee. (He also recently gave $1 million to a â€œsuper PACâ€ that supports Senator Rob Portman, the Republican freshman running for   in Ohio.) Getting involved in politics used to be seen as clashing with Silicon Valleyâ€™s value system: You transform the world by making problems obsolete, not solving them through Washington. Nor did entrepreneurs want to alienate whatever segment of customers did not agree with them politically. Such reticence is no longer in style here. â€œWeâ€™re a bunch of nerds not used to having a lot of limelight,â€ said Dave McClure, an investor who runs a tech incubator called 500 Startups. â€œBut to quote   â€˜With great power comes great responsibility. â€™â€ Mr. McClure grew worried after the Republican and Democratic conventions as Mr. Trump began to catch up to Hillary Clinton in the polls. He wanted Silicon Valley to do more, and so late last month he announced Nerdz4Hillary, an informal   effort. An initial group of donors pledged $50, 000 the goal was to ask the â€œnerdzâ€ for small donations to match that sum. They have not come through yet. â€œWeâ€™re kind of optimistic weâ€™ll get the other $50, 000 in a few weeks,â€ Mr. McClure said. That relatively slow pace reflects Silicon Valleyâ€™s shifting position: Even as it becomes increasingly free with its opinions, it has been less free with its checkbook. The most recent data, from late August, shows Mrs. Clinton taking in $7. 7 million from the tech community, according to Crowdpac, a   that tracks donations. By that point in 2012, Crowdpac says, President Obama had raised $21 million from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire   of the business networking site LinkedIn, offers a snapshot of Silicon Valleyâ€™s evolving approach to politics. Mr. Hoffman was a top Obama donor, giving $1 million to the Priorities USA political action committee, something several of his peers did as well. Last month, Mr. Hoffman garnered worldwide publicity for saying he would donate up to $5 million to veteransâ€™ groups if Mr. Trump released his taxes, a remote possibility that never came to pass. He has castigated Mr. Trump in interviews, saying he was speaking for those who were afraid. Mr. Hoffmanâ€™s outright donations, however, have been smaller this election cycle. In May, he gave $400, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Asked if there was more recent giving that had not shown up in federal election records, Mr. Hoffman cryptically responded in an email, â€œLooking at some PACs, etc. â€ He declined several opportunities to elaborate. Even as Priorities USA has raised $133 million this election cycle, far exceeding its total in 2012, its tech contributions have dwindled. The only familiar tech name this time around is John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, who gave $500, 000. The AOL   Steve Case said his September endorsement of Mrs. Clinton, via an   in The Washington Post, was the first time he ever publicly declared for a candidate. â€œI always focused on policy and avoided politics,â€ he said. â€œBut if Trump were elected president, I would be disappointed in myself for not acting. â€ When he wrote the   he was uncertain about donating money to Mrs. Clinton, saying only that it was â€œprobable. â€ A spokeswoman said Sunday that Mr. Case gave $25, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Mason Harrison, Crowdpacâ€™s head of communications, offered a possible reason for Mrs. Clintonâ€™s    support. â€œDonors give to support candidates they love, not to defeat candidates they fear,â€ he said. A few billionaires are acting instead of talking. Dustin Moskovitz, a founder of Facebook, said he was giving $20 million to various Democratic election efforts  â€”   the first time he and his wife, Cari Tuna, have endorsed a candidate. He declined to be interviewed. Part of the problem for Mrs. Clinton is that, however preferable she may be to Mr. Trump in the tech community, she pales in comparison to President Obama. After some initial misgivings, Silicon Valley found its champion in him. There has been a revolving door between tech and the Obama administration, just as previous Democratic administrations had a revolving door with Wall Street. In June, President Obama seemed to suggest that he might become a venture capitalist after his term ends. Mrs. Clinton is not as enthusiastic toward Silicon Valley and its disruptive ways. In a speech in the summer of 2015, she noted that   in the â€œ  or   gig economyâ€  â€”   Uber, Airbnb and their ilk  â€”   were â€œunleashing innovationâ€ but also â€œraising hard questions about workplace protection and what a good job will look like in the future. â€ The Clinton campaign declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not respond to a query. Even as Silicon Valley works against Mr. Trump, there is quiet acknowledgment that his campaign has bared some important issues. In an endorsement this month of Mrs. Clinton, the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures pointed out that â€œthe benefits of technology and globalization have not been evenly distributed,â€ and that this needed to change. If Silicon Valleyâ€™s political involvement outlasts this unusual election, the tech community may start contributing more to the process than commentary and cash. â€œNot only are tech people going to be wielding influence, but theyâ€™re going to be the candidate,â€ Mr. McClure said. â€œReid Hoffman, Sheryl Sandbergâ€  â€”   the chief operating officer of Facebook  â€”   â€œand a bunch of other folks here have political aspirations. â€ Others may be inspired to enter politics through other doors. Palmer Luckey is the    founder of the Oculus virtual reality company, which he sold to Facebook for $2 billion. Mr. Luckey donated $10, 000 to a group dedicated to spreading    messages about Mrs. Clinton both online and off. The groupâ€™s first billboard, said to be outside Pittsburgh, labeled her â€œToo Big to Jail. â€ Mr. Luckey told The Daily Beast that his thinking â€œwent along the lines of, â€˜Hey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff. â€™â€ He added, â€œI thought it sounded like a real jolly good time. â€ Many virtual reality developers were less happy, and Mr. Luckey quickly posted his regrets on Facebook. He declined to comment further. â€œIf weâ€™re going to be more vocal, weâ€™ll have to live more transparently,â€ said Hunter Walk, a venture capitalist whose campaign to persuade tech companies to give workers Election Day off signed up nearly 300 firms, including Spotify, SurveyMonkey and TaskRabbit. â€œThere will be a period of adjustment. â€ But perhaps being vocal is a temporary condition after all. The venture firm CRV was in the spotlight at the end of August with its blunt   message, which included the earthy epithet. A few weeks later, it cleaned up its website. The partners went from employing a publicist to seek out attention to declining interviews. â€œWe reached everyone we wanted to reach, and hopefully influenced opinions,â€ said Saar Gur, a CRV venture capitalist. â€œThen the buzz died down and we went back to our day jobs, which are super busy. â€"

Be Sociable, Share! (Rob Wilson photo) 
Native American leaders vowed on Saturday to protest through the winter against a North Dakota oil pipeline they say threatens water resources and sacred lands and are planning lawsuits over police treatment of arrested protesters. 
Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and other tribal leaders were working on providing food, heat and shelter for protesters opposed to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. 
â€œWeâ€™re just working through some technical details as far as where the land is, and the type of land that can be used for some permanent structures,â€ Archambault told reporters in Mandan, North Dakota on Saturday morning. 
At least 10 shelters were being readied on tribal land against temperatures that can fall below -35 Fahrenheit (-37 Celsius) for days at time, he said. 
â€œIt doesnâ€™t have to put our water at risk,â€ said Archambault, who was joined by Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier. 
The two leaders said theyâ€™re considering taking legal action against law enforcement. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II said more than 40 people were injured, including broken bones and welts from rubber bullets and bean bag rounds fired by law enforcement on Thursday, Oct. 27th. 
Archambault said his tribe may pursue a class action over police tactics. Officers in riot gear swept through a protester camp on private land using pepper spray, bean bag rounds and an audio cannon aiming high-pitched â€œsound cannonâ€ blasts against demonstrators. At least 142 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday. 
Protesters had numbers written on their arms and were housed in what appeared to be dog kennels, without bedding or furniture. 
â€œItâ€™s just wrong to use that type of force on innocent people,â€ Archambault said Saturday, Oct. 29, during a press conference in front of the Morton County Sheriffâ€™s Department. 
Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier said he has heard reports of inhumane treatment while people were incarcerated. 
â€œAll theyâ€™re doing is standing up to protect that water,â€ Frazier said. Here come reinforcements! As police attack & arrest land protectors thousands of buffalo storm #StandingRock https://t.co/NoQyIsWbxv #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/oMa647HviB 
â€” RoseAnn DeMoro (@RoseAnnDeMoro) October 28, 2016 
Meanwhile, Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) announced that they are sending a delegation of human rights observers to monitor the response of law enforcement to the protests. 
AIUSA also has sent a letter to the Morton County Sheriffâ€™s Department expressing concern about the degree of force used against the protests. The organization will also call on the Department of Justice to investigate police practices. 
AIUSA sent a delegation of observers to the area in August and has stayed in contact both with the Indigenous community and those policing the protests since then. Letters had previously been sent to the North Dakota Highway Patrol and the Morton County Sheriffâ€™s office calling for law enforcement officers to respect international human rights standards on the policing of protests. 
â€œOur observers are here to ensure that everyoneâ€™s human rights are protected,â€ said Eric Ferrero, director of communications for AIUSA. â€œWeâ€™re deeply concerned about what we heard during our previous visit to Standing Rock and what has been reported to us since.â€ 
In some instances, police have responded to protesters with pepper spray and bean bags, and in one instance, private security staff used guard dogs. Those recently arrested have reported being strip searched and forced to pay bail for minor offenses. Members of the media and legal observers have also been arrested or charged with minor offenses. 
â€œPeople here just want to stand up for the rights of Indigenous people and protect their natural resources. These people should not be treated like the enemy,â€ said Ferrero â€œPolice must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response.â€

20803,"Tim Tebow Will Attempt Another Comeback, This Time in Baseball - The New York Times",Daniel Victor,"If at first you donâ€™t succeed, try a different sport. Tim Tebow, who was a Heisman   quarterback at the University of Florida but was unable to hold an N. F. L. job, is pursuing a career in Major League Baseball. He will hold a workout for M. L. B. teams this month, his agents told ESPN and other news outlets. â€œThis may sound like a publicity stunt, but nothing could be further from the truth,â€ said Brodie Van Wagenen,   of CAA Baseball, part of the sports agency CAA Sports, in the statement. â€œI have seen Timâ€™s workouts, and people inside and outside the industry  â€”   scouts, executives, players and fans  â€”   will be impressed by his talent. â€ Itâ€™s been over a decade since Tebow, 28, has played baseball full time, which means a comeback would be no easy task. But the former major league catcher Chad Moeller, who said in the statement that he had been training Tebow in Arizona, said he was â€œbeyond impressed with Timâ€™s athleticism and swing. â€ â€œI see bat speed and power and real baseball talent,â€ Moeller said. â€œI truly believe Tim has the skill set and potential to achieve his goal of playing in the major leagues and based on what I have seen over the past two months, it could happen relatively quickly. â€ Or, take it from Gary Sheffield, the former   outfielder. News of Tebowâ€™s attempted comeback in baseball was greeted with skepticism on Twitter. As a junior at Nease High in Ponte Vedra, Fla. Tebow drew the attention of major league scouts, batting . 494 with four home runs as a left fielder. But he ditched the bat and glove in favor of pigskin, leading Florida to two national championships, in 2007 and 2009. Two former scouts for the Los Angeles Angels told WEEI, a Boston radio station, that Tebow had been under consideration as a high school junior. â€œâ€™x80â€™x9cWe wanted to draft him, â€™x80â€™x9cbut he never sent back his information card,â€ said one of the scouts, Tom Kotchman, referring to a questionnaire the team had sent him. â€œHe had a strong arm and had a lot of power,â€ said the other scout, Stephen Hargett. â€œIf he would have been there his senior year he definitely would have had a good chance to be drafted. â€ â€œIt was just easy for him,â€ Hargett added. â€œYou thought, If this guy dedicated everything to baseball like he did to football how good could he be?â€ Tebowâ€™s high school baseball coach, Greg Mullins, told The Sporting News in 2013 that he believed Tebow could have made the major leagues. â€œHe was the leader of the team with his passion, his fire and his energy,â€ Mullins said. â€œHe loved to play baseball, too. He just had a bigger fire for football. â€ Tebow wouldnâ€™t be the first athlete to switch from the N. F. L. to M. L. B. Bo Jackson had one   season as a Kansas City Royal, and Deion Sanders played several years for the Atlanta Braves with mixed success. Though Michael Jordan tried to cross over to baseball from basketball as a    in 1994, he did not fare as well playing one year for a Chicago White Sox minor league team. As a football player, Tebow was unable to match his college success in the pros. The Denver Broncos drafted him in the first round of the 2010 N. F. L. Draft, and he quickly developed a reputation for clutch performances, including a memorable   pass against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2011 Wild Card round. But his stats and his passing form werenâ€™t pretty, and he spent just two years in Denver before moving to the Jets in 2012, where he spent his last season on an N. F. L. roster. He was cut during preseason from the New England Patriots in 2013 and from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015."

All of a sudden, it was announced that Clinton would be cleared. Pravda.Ru asked political scientist and publicist Leonid Krutakov to comment on such a development.

20808,Urban Population Booms Will Make Climate Change Worse,nan,"Urban Population Booms Will Make Climate Change Worse Posted on Oct 27, 2016 
By Tim Radford / Climate News Network Flooded slums in the densely-populated city of Jakarta, Indonesia. (Kent Clark via Flickr) 
LONDONâ€”The worldâ€™s cities are growing even faster than the human population. Within the last 40 years, the global population has increased by a factor of 1.8, but built-up areas have multiplied 2.5 times . All of this information, and much more, appears in a new European Commission (EC) publication called the Atlas of the Human Planet , prepared to coincide with the recent third UN Habitat conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Atlas shows that, 40 years ago, most of the worldâ€™s 4.1billion population lived in rural areas. Now more than half live in towns and citiesâ€”urban clusters that cover 7.6% of the planetâ€™s land mass, equivalent to an area about half the size of the European Union. Most of the people in the world are crammed into urban centres with a density greater than 1,500 persons per square kilometre, and in settlements greater than 50,000 inhabitants. Altogether, geographers have identified 13,000 urban centres, altogether surrounded by 300,000 â€œurban clustersâ€ of at least 5,000 inhabitants living at a density of 300 per square kilometre. Population tripled And in the 40 years since the first UN Habitat conference in 1976, the population of Africa has tripled, while the built-up area of the continent has quadrupled. In wealthy Europe, the population remained stable, but the built-up area doubled. The research for the Atlas has been enriched by a new, free, open and global dataset, the Global Human Settlement Layer , developed by the ECâ€™s Joint Research Centre , and based on 12,400 billion individual satellite data readings over the past four decades. It provides, in every sense, an overview of a planet at work and at rest and struggling to survive. It confirms what most people would have suspected: that nine of the 10 most densely populated urban centresâ€”including Cairo in Egypt, Guangzhou in China, and Jakarta in Indonesiaâ€”are in the low-income countries. Researchers warn that whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded by climate change The largest urban centre in the world is Los Angeles in the US, eight of the 10 largest urban centres are in the high-income countries, and five of those are in the US. And a group of scientists led by Timon McPhearson, assistant professor of urban ecology at the New School in New York , publish a warning in Nature journal that more urban areas will be built in the next 30 years than ever before just to house and shelter the additional 1.1billion people expected in the next 14 yearsâ€”most of them in the crowded cities of Asia and Africa. Whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded, other researchers warn, by climate change â€”with ever more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods , and days of bad air quality. Around 40% of the worldâ€™s people live in coastal cities, and are therefore increasingly vulnerable to floods , tsunamis, surges and tropical storms. Because of the notorious urban â€œheat island effectâ€, cities are inevitably hotter than the surrounding countryside , and many are likely to face a crisis in the supply of safe, clean water . Swelling cities The new Atlas warns that the new, swelling cities will go on making ever greater demands on the farmland and wilderness beyond the cityâ€™s boundaries. In the last 15 years, 27,000 sq km of land was covered by housing, workshops and pavement. This is an area equal to Cyprus and Israel combined. If this growth continues at the present rate, an additional 1.1 million sq km of land will become built-up between 2015 and 2040â€”an area equal to the size of Ethiopia. In 119 countries, the urban population is between 70% and 90% of the total. In 25 countriesâ€”most of them in Asiaâ€”the city dwellers make up 90% of the population. Many of these are in megacities. The atlas records 50 â€œurban clustersâ€ of more than 10 million people, and one gigacityâ€”Beijingâ€”that is home to more than 100 million. Inevitably, in this growth explosion, the poorest are often most at risk, from floods, landslides, and other geophysical and climate-related potential disasters. In the last 40 years, the number of people living at or even below sea level has almost doubled from 45 million to 88 million, and the number living on steep slopes has increased from 70 million to 160 million.

20810,184 U.S. generals and admirals endorse Trump for Commander-In-Chief,Dr. Eowyn,"Have you seen that pro-Hillary TV ad of disgraced Gen. John Allen? 
Nauseating. 
You should know that in 2011, Allen, then a 4-star general in the U.S. Marine Corps, was nominated to be NATOâ€™s Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, pending confirmation by the Senate. On November 13, 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suspended Allenâ€™s confirmation hearing, pending investigations into the generalâ€™s â€œinappropriate communicationâ€ with a woman named Jill Kelley. Gen. John Allen (l); Jill Kelley (r) 
As part of the fallout of the Gen. David Petraeus -Paula Broadwell affair, the FBI uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of correspondence â€” mostly email â€” between Allen and Kelley from 2010 to 2012. Reportedly, their correspondence was â€œflirtatiousâ€ and â€œinappropriateâ€ as Allen and Kelley were both married at the time, but not to each other. 
Seriously, how can a 4-star general even have so much free time as to write 20,000 to 30,000 emails in the space of two years to ANYONE? 20,000 emails mean an average of 28 emails a day exchanged between Allen and Kelley; 30,000 emails mean an average of 42 emails a day. There is no one with whom Iâ€™ve exchanged 28 emails a day, even less 42 emails. 
The upshot: Not only did John Allen lose his confirmation as NATOâ€™s Supreme Allied Commander, he also lost his job as Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan â€” a post to which he was promoted to replace the disgraced Gen. Petraeus. (See â€œ Obama purges U.S. military command (Part 1) â€) 
Allen retired from the military in February 2013, but was appointed Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (or ISIS) â€” a post and title created for Allen by Obama, which Allen held for about a year from September 2014 until October 23, 2015. 
Allen was a featured speaker at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. He criticized Donald Trump and endorsed Hillary Clinton â€” who abandoned four Americans to die in Benghazi â€” for President. 
Like the New Yorker that he is, Trump fired back, calling Allen â€œa failed general.â€ 
Trump does have the endorsement of 184 non-failed and non-disgraced U.S. generals and admirals, including at least four 4-star and fourteen 3-star flag officers, as well as the endorsement of 14 Medal of Honor recipients. 
The endorsements began with an open letter on Sept. 6, 2016, from 88 retired U.S. general and admirals : â€œThe 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy. As retired senior leaders of Americaâ€™s military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. For this reason, we support Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy to be our next Commander-in-Chief. For the past eight years, Americaâ€™s armed forces have been subjected to a series of ill-considered and debilitating budget cuts, policy choices and combat operations that have left the superb men and women in uniform less capable of performing their vital missions in the future than we require them to be. Simultaneously, enemies of this country have been emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in Washington and opportunities for aggression at our expense and that of other freedom-loving nations. In our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous. That is especially the case if our government persists in the practices that have brought us to this present pass. For this reason, we support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically. We urge our fellow Americans to do the same.â€ 
Two days later on Sept. 8, another 21 retired U.S. generals and admirals joined the list, followed by 31 more the next day, on Sept. 9, and another 44 on Sept. 16, bringing the total number of flag officers who have endorsed Trump to 184.

20812,The Rise of Mandatory Vaccinations Means the End of Medical Freedom,Shaun Bradley,"Written by Shaun Bradley   Mandatory vaccinations are about to open up a new frontier for government control. Through the war on drugs, bureaucrats arbitrarily dictate what people can and canâ€™t put into their bodies, but that violation pales in comparison to forcibly medicating millions against their will. Voluntary and informed consent are essential in securing individual rights, and without it, self-ownership will never be respected. The liberal stronghold of California is trailblazing the encroaching new practice and recently passed laws mandating that children and adults must have certain immunizations before being able to attend schools or work in certain professions. The longstanding religious and philosophical exemptions that protect freedom of choice have been systematically crushed by the state. Californiaâ€™s Senate Bill 277 went into effect on July 1st, 2016, and marked the most rigid requirements ever instituted for vaccinations. The law forces students to endure a total of 40 doses to complete the 10 federally recommended vaccines while allowing more to be added at any time. Any family that doesnâ€™t go along will have their child barred from attending licensed day care facilities, in-home daycares, public or private schools, and even after school programs. Over the years, California has developed a reputation for pushing vaccines on their youth. Assembly Bill 499 was passed in 2011 and lowered the age of consent for STD prevention vaccines to just 12 years old. Included in the assortment of shots being administered was the infamous Gardasil , which just a few years later was at the center of a lawsuit that yielded the victims a $6 million settlement from the US government, which paid out funds from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program . The Vaccinate All Children Act of 2015 is an attempt to implement this new standard nationwide, and although it has stalled in the House, it will likely be reintroduced the next time the country is gripped by the fear of a pandemic. The debate surrounding vaccinations is commonly framed as a moral struggle between the benefits to the collective and the selfish preferences of the individual. But since the outbreak scares of Zika , measles , and ebola , the rhetoric has taken a turn toward authoritarianism. Itâ€™s commonly stated by the CDC and most mainstream doctors that the unvaccinated are putting the health of everyone else at risk, but the truth isnâ€™t so black and white . The herd immunity theory has been consistently used to validate the expansion of vaccine programs, but it still doesnâ€™t justify the removal of choice from the individual. The classic exchange of freedom for perceived safety is a no brainer for the millions of Americans who are willing to use government to strap their neighbors down and forcibly inject them for the greater good. Anyone who expresses concern about possible side effects is immediately branded as conspiratorial or anti-science. Yet controversial claims that certain vaccine variants cause neurological disorders like autism have led some people to swear off inoculations altogether. This all-or-nothing dynamic has completely polarized the issue and prevents any reasonable discussion from taking place. Either you accept all of the CDCâ€™s recommended 69 doses of 16 vaccines between birth and age 18, or you want to bring back measles, polio, and probably the black plague. On the other extreme side of the debate, if you fail to acknowledge all vaccines as dangerous, youâ€™re an ignorant sheep. Through the internet, disinformation has become widespread and created a movement of people that have written off all the benefits accomplished through immunizations. These individuals are unable or unwilling to separate the science from the shady institutions that develop and distribute new vaccines. Even if thimerosal and mercury based preservatives cause adverse reactions in some patients, it doesnâ€™t detract from the advantages vaccine technology provides. In this debate, like most others in the US, both sides are swept up in emotion and ignorance. Regardless, the publicâ€™s trust in vaccinations has been eroded by the reputations of those companies producing them. Pharmaceutical giants like Merck and Pfizer make billions from the distribution of these shots, and the potential profits after a mandate are enough to corrupt the morals of almost anyone. In one example, former CDC director Dr. Julie Gerberding left her post at the government agency in 2009 to work in Merckâ€™s vaccine division. An investigative report published by the British Medical Journal last year found the CDC downplays its ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Further, by buying the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton â€” who received more donations from pharmaceutical companies and their employees than any other candidate this year â€” these huge companies are able to expand their influence in directing government policy . Maintaining control over what we put into our own bodies is a fundamental right, but for now, standing up to these government decrees only means ostracism from the education system and criticism from peers. In the future, however, the punishments for disobedience will likely only grow stricter. An Orange County doctor named Bob Sears is already in the crosshairs of Californiaâ€™s medical board after excusing a two-year-old from future vaccinations. The mother expressed concern that her daughter had an adverse reaction to a previous shot, describing the child as becoming limp â€œlike a ragdollâ€ for 24 hours after the last dose. Dr. Searsâ€™ alternative treatment recommendations break from the rules dictated by S.B. 277, and now his reputation, as well as his career, are in jeopardy. This new authority to strip doctors of their medical licenses for simply going against the state-imposed standards opens the door for the persecution of medical professionals who resist any government regulation.A vaccination is an invasive medical procedure that can have different effects on each and every individual. The Nuremberg Codeâ€™s first principle is voluntary consent, but it seems the lessons of history have been completely forgotten by todayâ€™s leaders. The transition of these shots from â€œrecommendedâ€ to â€œrequiredâ€ is well underway, and those who think the ends justify the means are willing to forcibly make sure everyone else complies. The new benchmark set by California symbolizes a precedent that could be mimicked across the nation. Without having the discretion to choose which medications are injected into your body â€” or your childâ€™s â€” how can anyone convince themselves they are free? This overreach and collusion can often be dismissed as a trivial issue, but the fact that voluntary consent is under attack speaks volumes to the extent that state power has metastasized.

20814,"Computer Programmer Comes Forward, Admits To Being Paid To Rig Voting Booths! TRUMP WAS RIGHT! â€¢ USA Newsflash",Usa News Flash,"
VIA Conservative Tribune 
In 2000, computer programmer Clinton â€œClintâ€ Curtis was ordered to design an undetectable computer program that could flip the results of a close election, according to ClashDaily and the St. Petersburg Times, now the Tampa Bay Times . 
Curtis testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee that his employer, Yang Enterprises Inc., told him, â€œWe need to steal an election.â€ The program was intended for the computerized voting machines to which Florida would be transitioning starting in 2002.

This is it, folks. Despite the liberal mediaâ€™s efforts to convince us all otherwise and paint naysayers as conspiracy theorists, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is right. Rigging an election has never been easier. 
The left painted Clint Curtis as a nut, a conspiracy theorist, a disgruntled ex-employee. They published photoshopped images of him wearing a tinfoil hat and did everything possible to discredit one man who was standing up for the truth. 
Curtis voluntarily took a polygraph test, alleging that one of the consultants at his employer was a Chinese national and convicted spy. Yang Enterprises denied ever knowing consultant Hai Lin Nee, while in fact they had been assisting him for years in repeatedly extending his U.S. Visa. 
The Florida Department of Transportation inspector investigating the ballot tampering allegations, Raymond Lemme, was found dead in an apparent suicide. Both Curtis and Lemmeâ€™s family members believe he was murdered. 
In 2005, computer experts demonstrated for officials in Leon County, Florida, how simple it was to flip election results while leaving no detectable trace of their efforts. 
Where is the liberal media in all this? Where are the Democrats who are supposedly so concerned with our fundamental rights? 
Theyâ€™re in a back room, preparing to steal an election if the peopleâ€™s voice isnâ€™t heard on Election Day. On Nov. 8, be that decent person standing up for truth. 
What are your thoughts on this? Do you think that the election is rigged?

20815,"Thieves Take a Chunk of Change, All 221 Pounds of It, From a Berlin Museum - The New York Times",Melissa Eddy,"BERLIN  â€”   You could never palm it, flip it or plunk it into a vending machine. But apparently it can be pinched: One of the worldâ€™s largest gold coins, a   Canadian monster called the Big Maple Leaf, was stolen overnight from the Bode Museum in Berlin, the police said on Monday. The coin is about 21 inches in diameter and over an inch thick. It has the head of Queen Elizabeth II on one side and a maple leaf on the other. Its face value is 1 million Canadian dollars, or about $750, 000, but by gold content alone, it is worth as much as $4. 5 million at current market prices. And though it weighs about as much as a refrigerator, somehow thieves apparently managed to lug it through the museum and up at least one floor to get it out of a window at the back of the building. The police are still trying to figure out exactly how they did it. The Bode Museum, which sits on Museum Island in the Spree River, is part of the complex belonging to the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, or in German, the Preussischer Kulturbesitz. The local   commuter railway runs across the island along the back of the museum. The burglars seemed to have broken in through a window above the railway tracks during the     hours when the trains pause for the night. The police were alerted to the   at 4 a. m. and think that it took place between 3:20 a. m. and 3:45 a. m. The window, some three to four yards above the tracks, stood ajar and appeared to have been â€œforcibly opened,â€ said Winfrid Wenzel, a police spokesman. Officers searching the crime scene found a ladder on the elevated railwayâ€™s roadbed, which is near the museumâ€™s back wall. The police declined to give further details, including whether security cameras monitored that window, or whether the museumâ€™s alarm systems had gone off. The Big Maple Leaf had been on display since December 2010, on a floor below the window in its own bulletproof case. It was surrounded by other, smaller gold coins. The bulletproof glass â€œappeared to have been violently shattered,â€ Mr. Wenzel said. But the thieves seemed to know what they wanted the smaller gold coins were untouched. Given the coinâ€™s weight, the authorities said they suspected that more than one person was involved. Their theory for now is that the thieves dragged the coin through the museum, out the window and then along the railway track, possibly reaching a park on the opposite bank of the river near the Hackescher Markt, a public square in Berlin that is home to a number of   bars and cafes. The police appealed for clues from anyone who had been in the area at that time. Experts said it would be difficult to sell the stolen coin, but worried that it could be melted down and the gold resold on the open market. The museum is regularly closed on Mondays and is expected to reopen as planned on Tuesday. In addition to paintings, sculptures and other works of art, the museum displays what it says is one of the largest collection of coins and medals in the world, with about 500, 000 objects. The Royal Canadian Mint created its first   coin, in Canadian dollars, as a demonstration in 2007  â€”   â€œbecause we can,â€ the mint says on its website  â€”   to draw attention to its series of more modestly sized, if still costly, pure gold coins. But Alex Reeves, a spokesman for the mint, said it decided to produce up to 10 copies of the Big Maple Leaf after being approached by potential buyers. Interest, however, has been limited. Only five have been produced for sale to date the last delivery was made in 2008. â€œWe were satisfied with selling five coins we didnâ€™t expect to sell at all,â€ Mr. Reeves said. A granite display stand is supplied with the coin when purchased. Mr. Reeves said that the mint, which still has the first coin â€œsafe and sound in our high security vault,â€ moves it around in a trunk with casters similar to those used by traveling music acts and stage shows. Not included, however, is any sort of theft protection plan. â€œCustomers are responsible for security of their own assets,â€ Mr. Reeves said."
20816,"New England Patriotsâ€™ Owner, Still Sore at N.F.L., Has Payback in Sight - The New York Times",Ken Belson and Ben Shpigel,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass.  â€”   The N. F. L. likes portraying itself as one big family of owners, players and fans who, despite their differences, come together on game days. Yet at the Super Bowl in Houston in two weeks, the N. F. L. may have no choice but to air a public and profound grudge on national television. If the New England Patriots defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday as they are favored to do and go on to beat either the Atlanta Falcons or the Green Bay Packers for the title, the league commissioner, Roger Goodell, will have to present the Lombardi Trophy to Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the Patriots. The moment would be delicious payback for Kraft, who is still simmering about the   suspension his quarterback, Tom Brady, served as a result of the cheating scandal known as Deflategate, after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage. In spite  â€”   or, perhaps, because  â€”   of it all, New England went   this season and throttled the Houston Texans last week in its playoff opener. Kraft largely kept quiet while the Brady case played out. But in a recent interview, he made clear that he remains annoyed by how his best player and team were pilloried. â€œSometimes, the league really messes up, and I think they really messed this up badly,â€ he said in a   discussion in his Gillette Stadium office here. â€œBut weâ€™ve all agreed to subjugate our right to disrupt everythingâ€  â€”   the Patriots declined to fight the league over financial penalties it levied on the team  â€”   â€œI mean, we can, but weâ€™re a partnership. Thereâ€™s jealousy, thereâ€™s envy, thereâ€™s stupidity. Sometimes, life is unfair, and you have to suck it up and move on and not use it as an excuse. â€ Let bygones be bygones? Not quite. Goodell has not been seen at a Patriots home game in two years, and on Sunday, rather than face the wrath of Patriots fans, he will, for the second consecutive week, travel to Atlanta for the N. F. C. Championship game instead. This relationship may have evolved into one of the biggest tests of the diplomatic skills  â€”   in football and in his larger world of finance and philanthropy  â€”   that Kraft prides himself on. Never mind that he owns one of the most polarizing teams, one that, while certainly beloved in New England, has failed to attract the kind of passionate national following of the Cowboys or the Packers. Some of the distaste, of course, reflects a jealousy created by their four Super Bowl titles  â€”   and six appearances in the title game  â€”   over the last 15 years. But there is also the coach, Bill Belichick, who although most likely headed to the Hall of Fame, is hard to love with his taciturn and grumpy manner in public. Also not helping are a series of scandals, including New Englandâ€™s spying on the New York Jets in 2007, and another involving a former player, Aaron Hernandez, who was convicted of committing a murder that occurred while he was a member of the team. And Brady and those footballs. So the internet likes to discuss things like â€œ15 Reasons Why People Hate the New England Patriots. â€ Kraft, a native of Brookline, Mass. who bought the Patriots 23 years ago for a   $172 million, chalks up such animosity to the teamâ€™s success. He has an apartment in Manhattan, and in the years after he bought the team, he would get razzed by people on the street. â€œThey used to be aggressive and nasty, and now theyâ€™re more respectful because I think weâ€™ve been able to do pretty well and sustained it,â€ Kraft said. Still, the friction cuts against the image of affability and reason that Kraft, 75, likes to project. When a New York Times reporter stepped into his office, the first thing Kraft did was hand him two small cartons of eggs from his family farm, assuring him they would be the best he had ever eaten. On his desk facing visitors was a small plaque with the greeting â€œShalom Yâ€™all!â€ The 30 minutes allotted for the interview went on way longer, though some of it was given to asides and   tangents. Kraft, whose billions come primarily from a packaging and paper empire and an assortment of other investments, sidestepped questions about whether winning a Super Bowl would have any extra meaning this year. Until Deflategate, he and Goodell publicly got along well, and Kraft takes pride in his facility for building relationships with a wide range of sports figures, celebrities, politicians and business leaders. One week, Secretary of State John Kerry might join him in his suite, and the next itâ€™s media titans like Rupert Murdoch and Leslie Moonves. Among N. F. L. owners, whose politics tilt Republican, Kraft is among the most loyal donors to Democratic candidates. Yet he, as well as Brady and Belichick, considers   Donald J. Trump a good friend, a tricky relationship in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, which voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin. Kraft said they met 20 years ago when Trump invited him to play golf at his club in West Palm Beach, Fla. â€œLoyalty is important to me, and he has been a wonderful friend,â€ Kraft said. â€œI think one of the great problems in the country today is the working poor, the middle class, that there hasnâ€™t been growth in income on an equal basis, and I really think the policies heâ€™s going to bring to bear are going to be great for the economic side of America. â€ It is hard to tell if his association with Trump is costing the team fans, but then, as a team owner and businessman, he is used to being a target. He has had legal fights with business partners, including those with a stake in the land where Gillette Stadium now stands. Patriots fans, too, lashed out at Kraft for not doing more to fight the N. F. L. during Deflategate. Yet he is influential enough in the league that owners and officials prefer to keep their criticisms of him to private conversations. When Kraft and other team owners clash over league issues, it is usually behind closed doors. â€œWe do have dissent and do have things I think you couldnâ€™t help but have,â€ said the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, who rivals Kraft for influence in the league. â€œI think Bob has exhibited disagreement, but heâ€™s also very capable of making and influencing change. Iâ€™m someone, if he has ideas, I would certainly be a good listener. â€ Kraft is still a very   owner, but three of his sons have taken on greater responsibilities with the Patriots and the familyâ€™s portfolio of company investments, including a Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution. More and more, Kraft said, he is focusing on strategizing and bringing people together. Like Arabs and Jews. He has sought to broker Middle East conciliation through sports and investments, citing economic interdependence as a unifying agent. Several years ago, Kraft, who is Jewish, operated a packaging company that employed Israelis and Palestinians. He has taken dozens of Christian friends to Israel, including Brady and, in 2015, 19 former N. F. L. players, some of whom were baptized in the Jordan River. Still, though he often portrays himself as a unifier, some people  â€”   or teams  â€”   do irk him. Like the Indianapolis Colts. During halftime in a victory over the Miami Dolphins last season, while praising Willie McGinest, a linebacker inducted into the teamâ€™s hall of fame that night, Kraft made sure to point out that McGinest was on teams that beat the Colts 16 times in 12 seasons. It was seven months after the Colts first suggested that New England used underinflated balls in the A. F. C. Championship game they lost,  . McGinest said he understood how Kraft could still be offended. â€œWhen you take away from somebodyâ€™s hard work or everything that goes into winning those types of games, itâ€™s pretty upsetting,â€ said McGinest, now an analyst for NFL Network. â€œThatâ€™s his baby. Those players are all his. That team, itâ€™s his baby. â€ At the Patriots, Kraft  â€”   and, before her death from cancer in 2011, his wife, Myra  â€”   has had a reputation for forming lasting relationships with his players and engaging in conversations with them beyond football. The Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin grew close to the Krafts during his three seasons in New England. Martin, who identifies as a Christian, spent some Jewish holidays with the Krafts and so grew to love chicken soup served by Myra Kraft that she would give some to her husband to place in Martinâ€™s locker. â€œI didnâ€™t deem it as normal,â€ Martin, who also traveled to Israel with Kraft, said in a telephone interview. â€œI thought it was something that was very rare. â€ Now a businessman himself, Martin cherishes the day during his rookie season, in 1995, when Kraft invited him to a   plant he owned. â€œEverything has a process to it,â€ Martin said, explaining the lesson he learned. â€œAnd when you neglect the process, you ultimately neglect your ability to be successful at whatever youâ€™re striving for. Thatâ€™s an experience Iâ€™ll never forget. â€ Kraft, former players say, is a regular presence in the locker room, where   personnel rarely tread, greeting players, even those who are not stars, by name. Sometimes, he can show a playful,   side. During receiver Donte Stallworthâ€™s first stint in New England, in 2007, he and Randy Moss were leaving the cafeteria on their way to the receivers meeting room when Kraft stopped them in the hallway and handed them a manila folder. Opening it, Moss and Stallworth burst into laughter: Inside was a photograph of Kraft and the rapper 50 Cent sipping mai tais on a beach. â€œI know you two young men are pretty cool and you guys are young studs,â€ Kraft told them, according to Stallworth. â€œIâ€™m an old guy, but Iâ€™m not too bad myself. â€ Stallworth added: â€œHe doesnâ€™t walk around like he owns the place, even though he does. â€ Indeed, Kraft was very at home in his office, which is stuffed with photos, memorabilia and knickknacks. Cradling a big cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee, Kraft spoke about how he had managed to maintain consistent success at the Patriots, whether they win the Super Bowl this year or not. â€œMy job is to keep everyone together, strong big egos, and keep the peace in the family,â€ he said. Looming large near his desk, propped against a wall, was a painting of Brady."
20817,"College Republicans, YAF Sue Berkeley over Ann Coulter Event - Breitbart",Tom Ciccotta,"The Berkeley College Republicans and the Young Americaâ€™s Foundation have filed a lawsuit against members of the University of California system for their role in restricting an upcoming speaking event featuring Ann Coulter. [Our lawsuit agst Berkeley filed moments ago. @thomasfullerNYT at failing NYT wonâ€™t understand it. Read it yourself https:  .   â€”   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 24, 2017,   The suit alleges that administrators unlawfully violated the studentâ€™s rights to free expression on campus by placing unusual restrictions on events that the Berkeley College Republicans organized. An event featuring renowned conservative commentator David Horowitz was canceled after the university forced students to hold the event at 3 PM when most students are in class, at a venue far from the center of campus. According to the suit, Berkeley is accused of engaging in a discriminatory practice of applying unusual time and venue restrictions on events planned by the UCB College Republicans. These restrictions have led to the cancellation of two events in the month of April 2017. Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of enforcing a recently adopted, unwritten and unpublished policy that vests in University officials the unfettered discretion to unreasonably restrict the time, place, and manner of any campus event involving â€œ  speakersâ€  â€”   a term that is wholly undefined, and that has enabled Defendants to apply this policy in a discriminatory fashion, resulting in the marginalization of the expression of conservative viewpoints on campus by any notable conservative speaker. Defendants freely admit that they have permitted the demands of a faceless, rabid,   mob to dictate what speech is permitted at the center of campus during prime time, and which speech may be marginalized, burdened, and regulated out of its very existence by this unlawful hecklerâ€™s veto. The suit condemns the University of California system for failing to provide an academic environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, which students were promised at the time of their enrollment. Though UC Berkeley promises its students an environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, it had breached this promise through the repressive actions of University administrators and campus police, who have systematically and intentionally suppressed   expression by Plaintiffs (and the many UC Berkeley students whose political viewpoints align with Plaintiffs) simply because that expression may anger or offend students, UC Berkeley administators,   community members who do not share Plaintiffsâ€™ viewpoints.

20818,Trump Melts Down And Accuses The US Postal Service Of Stealing The Election For Clinton,Jason Easley,"Trump warned his supporters that the US Postal Service is trying to steal the election for Hillary Clinton in Colorado. 
Video: 
At a rally in Golden, CO, Trump said: 
I have real problems with ballots being sent. Does that make sense? 
Like people saying, â€œOh, hereâ€™s a ballot. Hereâ€™s another ballot. Throw it away. Oh, hereâ€™s one I like. Weâ€™ll keep that one.â€ 
I have real problems, so get your ballots in. 
Trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails. 
Donald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote. 
Consider the contradiction in Trumpâ€™s message. The Republican nominee tells his supporters that the US Postal Service is throwing away ballots, while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots. 
If their ballots are going to be thrown away by USPS, why should Republicans bother mailing their ballots in? 
It is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense. Trumpâ€™s inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why Republicans on pace to lose this election. 
Donald Trumpâ€™s descent into paranoid senior citizen continues to play out in front of the entire nation, as the Republican nominee for president believes that his letter carrier is out to get him,"
20819,Visiting Madagascar? Leave Red Swimsuits (and Lemur Recipes) at Home - The New York Times,Bryant Rousseau,"If you visit a certain beach in northeastern Madagascar, donâ€™t wear red and donâ€™t even think of speaking French. Across most of the island nation, be very careful where you point, lest your finger accidentally find an ancestorâ€™s grave. And in certain areas of the country, do your best not to defecate in the same place twice. Behavior in Madagascar is governed by thousands of cultural taboos, or fady (pronounced  ) many of which involve food (donâ€™t eat goat or eel) days of the week (no funerals or farming on Tuesday) and objects (donâ€™t use shovels with firm handles to bury the dead). Specific places associated with ancestors, who are revered, also carry a lot of fady (no playing of a game similar to    near a tomb). Some of these prohibitions apply only in a single community, or even to a single family, while others are followed regionally. Breaking a fady invites both social shame and even direr consequences from the ancestors believed to enforce them. The repercussions can be as specific as the taboos: Sing while eating and your teeth will grow uncomfortably long. If a fady is considered overly onerous  â€”   say, a travel restriction that interferes with a promising business opportunity  â€”   a ritual negotiation can be held with the ancestors. To outsiders, fady can seem like a long and random list of superstitious rules, some silly (donâ€™t build verandas, and donâ€™t pass an egg directly to another person) some environmentally beneficial (eating most species of lemurs is fady, as is fishing in certain parts of the sea, to the benefit of coral reefs) and some harmful (among the Antambahoaka, an ethnic group in the southeast, a fady against raising twins led to a practice of abandoning them in the forest, and a fady against eating dried sweet potato has contributed to malnutrition). But Sarah Osterhoudt, an anthropologist at Indiana University, said fady are crucial to the identity and worldview of the Malagasy, as the people of Madagascar are known. â€œTo the Malagasy, the idea of bringing together all different parts of life  â€”   the past and the present, the social and the political, the spiritual and the mundaneâ€  â€”   is very important, she said. â€œFady do this beautifully. â€"
20820,Reeseâ€™s Peanut Butter Cups â€“ Cheap and Full of Toxic Chemicals,REALdeal,"by ANYA V 
In 1928, a man named H.B. Reese, created the peanut butter cup. Mr. Reese was a dairy farmer and a shipping forman for Milton S. Hershey, and found him inspiring. 
Mr. Reese left dairy farming and created the Harry Burnett Reese Candy Co. in his basement within his home located in Hershey Pennsylvania. In 1956, Mr. Reese died, leaving his candy company to his six sons. In 1963, the Reeseâ€™ sons merged their fathersâ€™ company with the Hershey Chocolate Corp. The merger was a tax-free, stock-for-stock merger. The six brothers received 666,316 common stocks valued at $23.5 million dollars in 1963. There are now 20 variations of Reese peanut butter cups. Even though Mr. Reese created a tasty candy and his six sons made wise business partnerships, their candyâ€™s ingredients have become questionable. 
Reeseâ€™s Peanut Butter Cups are made with the controversial ingredient PGPR (Polyglycerol polyricinoleate, which is used as a substitute for cocoa butter. The FDA has determined it to be â€œsafe for humans as long as you restrict your intake to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Otherwise youâ€™d be open to reversible liver enlargement at higher intakesâ€. 
Letâ€™s take a look at the other ingredients in one of the worldsâ€™ most favorite candy. 
Reeseâ€™s peanut butter cup ingredients: 
Milk chocolate, (milk, chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, no fat milk, milk fat, lactose, soy lecithin, PGPR), peanuts, sugar, dextrose, salt, TBHQ and citric acid. 
â€¢PGPR (polyglycerol pilyricinoleate): Reeseâ€™s are made with this controversial ingredient PGPR that has replaced cocoa butter in an effort to cut down on manufacturing costs. PGPR is made from castor beans that reduces the viscosity of chocolate. This chemical has been found to cause gastrointestinal discomfort and allergic reaction in children. 
â€¢Soy lecithin: 93% of soy is genetically modified. Soy lecithin can cause breast cancer, has negative effects on fertility and reproduction, may lead to behavioral and cerebral abnormalities. ( Read More About Soy Lecithin ) 
â€¢TBHQ (tertiary butylhydroquinone): TBHQ comes from petroleum and is related to butane. This can be toxic and also cause nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ear, delirium and collapse. It is shown to cause stomach cancer in lab rats, fragment DNA and cause damage to humane lung and umbilical cells. In children it can cause anxiety, restlessness, and intensify the symptoms of ADHD.

It brought Pergamon to New York last spring and got the balance of giant and delicate right. It flew in medieval Jerusalem, and kept its multicultural sprawl intact. Now, in the exhibition  â€œAge of Empires: Chinese Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 B. C. . D. 220),â€ it brings us China becoming China in a   take as strange and warm as life. We love life, of course, all the details: sparrows in the forsythia books and lamps and   coffee the voice of a friend on the phone. The ancient Chinese loved it, too, and wanted it to last forever. Chinaâ€™s first emperor believed it might. He viewed death as a kind of power nap, from which heâ€™d awake refreshed in a tomb that was like an earthly home, but better, more fun. He designed his mausoleum as an underground    with countless pavilions, great feng shui and a major security force. For light, there were candles, the most expensive money could buy, guaranteed to keep burning after heâ€™d moved in  â€”   he died in 210 B. C.  â€”   and the doors had shut for the last time. Those lights are still burning in the Metâ€™s hypnotic,     exhibition of 160 objects from 32 museums in China, which opens on Monday. Of the museumâ€™s several presentations of Chinese antiquities over the past 20 years, this one is probably the most dramatic visually and the most accessible emotionally. Thereâ€™s a certain amount of the type of art the Met is too comfortable with: imperial bling. But here even this material feels purposeful, because it dates from a time in China when the idea of empire and corporate branding through art was experimental. By the third century B. C. the   Zhou dynasty had run its course, and turf wars broke out among smaller regional states. One of those states, the kingdom of Qin (pronounced CHIN) overcame all rivals and brought much of China under one rule for the first time. It did this partly through armed strength, but also through a sort of management savvy taught in business schools today. The Qin ruler, born Ying Zheng, decided that the most effective means of control was to promote team spirit: Get everyone on the same civic page, and keep them there. To that end, he instituted a unified currency and a single standard of weights and measures. He decreed the use of a universal written script, which let him control the political conversation. And he initiated construction of the Great Wall, a    statement of Us versus Them. The effect of all this was to create a rudimentary sense of shared identity within a diverse population a sense of   or  â€”   to use a modern English word that may derive from Qin  â€”    . The M. B. A. thinking worked, or did for Ying Zheng himself. He became the first Chinese ruler to assume the   title of emperor  â€”   Qin Shihuangdi, or First Emperor of Qin  â€”   and built a tomb near Xian, in northwestern China, to match its grandeur. We have only written accounts of whatâ€™s in the tomb (the pavilions, the candles itâ€™s never been excavated). But its presence yielded one of the   â€™s great art historical finds when, in 1978, on a tip from local farmers, archaeologists uncovered an army of some 7, 000     figures buried nearby. Five of those figures, four standing, one kneeling, open the Met show (along with two modern reproductions of buried chariots found with them). They, or their like, have been endlessly circulated for display, but theyâ€™re still magnetic, with their blocklike bodies and personable faces,   and customized. Even more striking, and less familiar, is another figure found in a different part of the tomb site, this one a beefy court entertainer, nude to the waist, with every fold of flesh and swell of muscle precisely rendered. There was no precedent in China for any of this, the scale, the naturalism. So what was the source? Historians point to a likely one: the Hellenistic art that was introduced by Alexander the Great to Asia  â€”   at Pergamon, for example  â€”   and filtered over trade routes to China. Whatever its origins, the new sculpture adds another facet to the profile of  : cosmopolitan taste. But for all its innovations, or maybe because of them, Qin rule was brief, 15 years. The emperor spent a lot of time on the road, surveying his domain but also on a quest for   elixirs. His sudden death unleashed an   drama of assassinations, suicides and civil war, until another imperial power, called Han, took its place, and held it more than four centuries. Han artists built on Qin precedents in art, but with adjustments. For a while they maintained an interest in realism, but seemed to shift the emphasis from the human figure to the natural world. The big personalities in Han sculpture in the show are animals: horses as majestic as gods elephants, foreign to China, closely observed. Even common barnyard creatures  â€”   chickens, goats and pigs  â€”   are portrayed with empathy you can almost hear them clucking and snuffling. The Han further refined the policy of centralized imperial rule and expanded its reach outward, globally, evident in the steady increase in material richness and variety seen as you move through the show, past granulated gold work, amethyst necklaces and luxury textiles brought overland and by sea from Afghanistan, India, Persia, nomadic Eurasia and the Mediterranean. Some of the most exotic items are from China itself. An   fantastically sophisticated bronze cowrie shell container, swarming with tiny figures in what looks like a raucous Bruegelesque market scene, was produced by the Dian culture in what is now Yunnan province, people that Han court records referred to as â€œsouthwestern barbarians. â€ Was that imperialism or provincialism speaking? They can be the same thing. And they can equally motivate people to shape an exclusive group identity. The Han were intent on doing so, though this didnâ€™t prevent them from borrowing heavily from other cultures, including their immediate predecessors. As with the Qin, Han society, at least at elite levels, focused on the hereafter. Most items in the Met show came from graves. Many objects were specifically for funerary use. Like much art everywhere, the underlying inspiration was political and personal. Art promoted and shored up the hierarchies on which a culture was built. It also answered to a human need to keep life going. The Han elite spared no expense to ensure their continuance. The survivors of a Han princess named Dou Wan encased her corpse in a jumpsuit made from 2, 000 jade plaques linked with gold threads, jade being a stone thought to have preservative properties. The suit is in the show, and as we approach through a passageway in Zoe Florenceâ€™s theatrical exhibition installation, it looks like a sleeping extraterrestrial, a space traveler patiently waiting to be beamed up. Yet everything in the surrounding galleries seems designed to anchor the traveler to life on earth: a little   in the form of a carved jade bear a silk pillow woven with the words â€œextend yearsâ€ a vogueing earthenware dancer with   sleeves and a   wine jar that, when discovered in 2003, still held Han wine. Thereâ€™s even a luxury   or a model of one, and lamps to light it, including one shaped like a tree sprouting ducks and dragons like spring buds. At the end of the show  â€”   organized by Zhixin Jason Sun, a curator of Chinese art at the Met, assisted by Pengliang Lu, a curatorial fellow  â€”   thereâ€™s a low closed door, carved from stone, made for a tomb, and painted with figures that could be earthly or celestial. If you passed through the door, which life would you be entering, or leaving, and is there a preference? An answer may lie in an object hanging on the exhibitionâ€™s exit wall. Itâ€™s a round   mirror with an inscription embossed on its rim: â€œMay the Central Kingdom be peaceful and secure, and prosper for generations and generations to come, by following the great law that governs all. â€ Central Kingdom meant China. And for the Qin and the Han, wherever you went, in this world or the next, you were there."

20827,"Bill Weld, Running as a Libertarian, Likens Donald Trumpâ€™s Immigration Plan to Kristallnacht - The New York Times",Maggie Haberman and Thomas Kaplan,"William F. Weld, the   former Republican governor of Massachusetts, who was last seen campaigning in the 2006 Republican primary for governor of New York, now hopes to be on a national ticket as the   nominee of the Libertarian Party. And he is already on the attack. In his first interview since accepting an invitation to be the running mate of former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, Mr. Weld assailed Donald J. Trump over his call to round up and deport the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. â€œI can hear the glass crunching on Kristallnacht in the ghettos of Warsaw and Vienna when I hear that, honest,â€ Mr. Weld said Thursday. Mr. Weld, 70, was not uniformly critical of the presumptive Republican nominee. â€œI donâ€™t consider myself part of the Never Trump movement,â€ he said, expressing admiration for Mr. Trumpâ€™s success in the primary contest. â€œIâ€™m not horrified about everything Mr. Trump has done at all,â€ he said, adding: â€œI think heâ€™s done a lot. But when I think about some of the positions, I think theyâ€™re way out there. â€ Where he differs with Mr. Trump most sharply is on Mr. Trumpâ€™s call for mass deportations. Asked if he believed Mr. Trump was a fascist, Mr. Weld demurred. â€œMy Kristallnacht analogy does evoke the Nazi period in Germany,â€ he said. â€œAnd thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m worried about: a slippery slope. â€ After a circuitous answer, he eventually came to a conclusion. â€œNo, I wouldnâ€™t call Mr. Trump either a fascist or a Nazi,â€ Mr. Weld said. â€œIâ€™m just saying, we got to watch it when we get exclusionary about people on account of their status as a member of a group. â€ Mr. Weld also objected to Mr. Trumpâ€™s repeated threats to impose tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and China. â€œThatâ€™s a pretty good prescription to having China be the only superpower in about 10 years,â€ he said, leaning forward to make sure a reporter understood him. â€œChina  â€”   not the U. S. â€ Mr. Weldâ€™s best known previous turn on the national stage was in 1997, when he resigned as governor to focus on his appointment by President Bill Clinton as ambassador to Mexico. That did not go well: He was blocked by Senator Jesse Helms and withdrew his nomination after a heated battle in which Mr. Weld, a pillar of what was left of the moderate northeastern Republican establishment, loudly assailed Mr. Helms and the archconservatives who stood behind him. A former prosecutor, Mr. Weld could appeal to some disaffected Republicans on a ticket alongside Mr. Johnson at a time when other efforts by Republicans to recruit a   candidate  â€”   in part in the hopes of keeping   Republican voters from staying home and costing the partyâ€™s   candidates  â€”   are close to fizzling. Mr. Weld said Mr. Johnson, the Libertarian presidential candidate in 2012 who is seeking the partyâ€™s nomination again, spoke to him last weekend about running. Their hope is to amass enough support in national polls to be included in the presidential debates. If that happened, Mr. Weld said hopefully, it would not be impossible to envision a   ticket winning the White House. But he also did not protest too much when asked how he would reassure those who, mindful of his willingness to roll the dice in politics, might question his level of commitment to a national run. â€œThereâ€™s some truth in that,â€ said Mr. Weld, who now works at a law firm, Mintz Levin, and its lobbying arm, ML Strategies. â€œI do like to climb mountains in politics, and I do enjoy running for office. â€ The Libertarian Party says it already will be on the ballot in 32 states and is working on the rest. It will pick its presidential and   nominees at a convention over Memorial Day weekend in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Weld suggested that the Libertarian message, which emphasizes civil liberties and small government, could appeal to younger voters. Discussing foreign policy, he spoke critically of the Iraq invasion of 2003 and of putting â€œboots on the groundâ€ in the Middle East to project American strength. But he was supportive of the Obama administration on the Iran nuclear deal that Republicans frequently criticize. â€œI thought the game was worth the candle there, and thatâ€™s politically incorrect in almost all circles  â€”   certainly in Republican circles  â€”   but I think I do feel that way, and I followed that closely,â€ Mr. Weld said, adding, â€œI know John Kerry quite well and I saw his going back and forth, and rather admired it. â€ (Mr. Weld unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Kerry in the 1996 Senate race.) Asked about Hillary Clinton, Mr. Weld noted that he had known her since they were both in their 20s. â€œIâ€™ve always just thought of her as a really great kid,â€ he said. Mr. Weld said he possessed a deep libertarian streak, and pined for a time when that was more widespread in the Republican Party. He complained about the polarization in Congress and remembered his early days working on Capitol Hill, before law school, for Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York. â€œIt was a totally different era and a wonderful era,â€ he said. â€œIt was wonderful to be in Washington in those days. And things absolutely got done. â€"
20828,How Housingâ€™s New Players Spiraled Into Banksâ€™ Old Mistakes - The New York Times,"Matthew Goldstein, Rachel Abrams and Ben Protess","When the housing crisis sent the American economy to the brink of disaster in 2008, millions of people lost their homes. The banking system had failed homeowners and their families. New investors soon swept in  â€”   mainly private equity firms  â€”   promising to do better. But some of these new investors are repeating the mistakes that banks committed throughout the housing crisis, an investigation by The New York Times has found. They are quickly foreclosing on homeowners. They are losing familiesâ€™ mortgage paperwork, much as the banks did. And many of these practices were enabled by the federal government, which sold tens of thousands of discounted mortgages to private equity investors, while making few demands on how they treated struggling homeowners. The rising importance of private equity in the housing market is one of the most consequential transformations of the   American financial landscape. A home, after all, is the single largest investment most families will ever make. Private equity firms, and the mortgage companies they own, face less oversight than the banks. And yet they are the cleanup crew for the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression. Out of the more than a dozen private equity firms operating in the housing industry, The Times examined three of the largest to assess their impact on homeowners and renters. Lone Star Fundsâ€™ mortgage operation has aggressively pushed thousands of homeowners toward foreclosure, according to housing data, interviews with borrowers and records obtained through a Freedom of Information request. Lone Star ranks among the countryâ€™s biggest buyers of delinquent mortgages from the government and banks. Nationstar Mortgage, which leaped over big banks to become the   collector of mortgage bills, repeatedly lost loan files and failed to detect errors in other documents. These mistakes, according to confidential regulatory records from a 2014 examination, put â€œborrowers at significant risk of servicing and foreclosure abuses. â€ Unlike the banks, Nationstar wears many hats at once: mortgage bill collector, auction house for foreclosed homes and lender to new borrowers. By working every angle, and collecting fees at each step, the company faces potential conflicts of interest that enable it to make money on what is otherwise a costly foreclosure process. In the rental market, The Times found, other big private equity firms largely bypassed the nationâ€™s poorest neighborhoods as they scooped up and renovated foreclosed homes across the country. Those firms include Blackstone, a huge private equity firm and the nationâ€™s largest private landlord of rental houses. These decisions point to shortcomings of the governmentâ€™s response to the housing crisis. Rather than enact sweeping changes to housing policy, the government largely handed the problems to a new set of companies. Normie Brown and her husband, Derrick, have lost two fights  â€”   first with their bank and then with private equity. Initially, the Texas couple say, they faced a wrongful foreclosure by Bank of America. The bank paid them $50, 000 as part of a broader government settlement over suspected mortgage abuses, and the Browns used that money to fight for their house in court. But the couple couldnâ€™t stop their new bill collector, Nationstar, from auctioning off their home. â€œYou think all you have to do is show them where they did you wrong, and basically justice will prevail,â€ Mr. Brown said. â€œThat wasnâ€™t the case. â€ The court hadnâ€™t yet decided the case, but it didnâ€™t matter: They lost their house. The couple has since separated and Mr. Brown, a decorated Gulf War veteran, said he had moved in and out of homelessness. Nationstar declined to comment on the Brownsâ€™ case, but said it had outperformed banks on avoiding foreclosure. Nationstarâ€™s chief executive, Jay Bray, said in an interview that â€œforeclosure is always, always the last resort. â€ Private equity plowed into the housing market after big banks and regional lenders, facing a crackdown from federal regulators for wrongful foreclosure practices, pulled back in the aftermath of the crisis. The shift led private equity firms to spend tens of billions of dollars acquiring homes and troubled mortgages from banks and the government. For private equity firms, which specialize in buying companies at a bargain, the housing market was just their latest investment in a distressed asset. These firms, unlike banks, raise money for their deals from pension funds and other huge institutional investors. The wave of private equity investment in housing has had a positive impact on the American economy. The firms displaced poorly performing banks. They also helped stabilize the nationâ€™s housing market, and it achieved that through smart business decisions about where to put its money. That, in turn, rewarded investors  â€”   which is how private enterprise is supposed to work. But much of this investment has not benefited poor neighborhoods. Banks are expected, under the Community Reinvestment Act, to help meet the credit needs of   neighborhoods in areas they serve. Private equity has no such obligation. The idea is that banks should follow an implicit social contract: In return for government loans and other support, they are expected to serve a communityâ€™s needs. Private equity, which unlike the banks does not borrow money from the government, is answerable to its investors. Those investors include some of the nationâ€™s largest pension plans, whose members  â€”   teachers and police officers among them  â€”   may support improvements to such   areas. As a result, The Times found, private equity has focused on buying newer homes in   areas like the suburbs of Tampa, Fla. They have largely avoided more urban communities with older homes, because doing so would be less lucrative for their investors. â€œThere has been a missed opportunity here,â€ said Dan Immergluck, a professor of city and regional planning at the Georgia Tech College of Design, who has studied the effect of the financial crisis on housing. â€œThey are pushing the market up at the top end and neglecting the bottom end. â€ Government officials are also concerned that private equityâ€™s mortgage firms face less scrutiny than banks. While banks are examined by regulators for financial soundness, no similar testing occurs for private equityâ€™s companies. Ginnie Mae, which issues securities backed by mortgages with government guarantees, wants Congress to grant it greater oversight over nonbank mortgage firms and provide money to perform â€œstress tests. â€ The fear is that one firmâ€™s failure would create hardship for millions of customers. â€œItâ€™s an Achillesâ€™ heel for us to some degree,â€ said Ted Tozer, Ginnie Maeâ€™s president. Buried in a confidential bond document, in a jumble of legalese, Lone Star explains to investors one way it profits from delinquent loans. Lone Starâ€™s mortgage subsidiary will lower a borrowerâ€™s monthly payment if â€œthe net present value of a modification is greater than the net present value of a foreclosure, loan sale or short sale. â€ Translation: If foreclosing on a homeowner is the most profitable option, Lone Star is likely to foreclose. Federal officials hoped things would be different. In 2012, America was still in the grips of the worst housing crisis in decades. Foreclosure signs lined the American landscape, casting a shadow on more than 3. 5 million homes. In some communities, abandoned houses outnumbered occupied ones. And soured mortgages made by banks were weighing on the government because it had insured them against default. The government, eager to stem its own losses, decided to ramp up the sale of distressed mortgages to investors. In all, it has sold more than 100, 000 soured mortgages to investors  â€”   one of the largest such series of sales. The mortgage sales enticed private equity firms like Lone Star into the mortgage market, where they saw bargains. Housing officials reckoned that private equity firms would bring about change. For one thing, these firms were among the only investors with pockets deep enough to take on billions of dollars worth of ailing mortgages. And they could be more flexible than the banks in keeping Americans in their homes because they had bought the mortgages at steep discounts. But instead of showing greater flexibility, Lone Star  â€”   much like the banks before it  â€”   has often remained rigid about modifying mortgages. And in some cases it has moved quickly to foreclose, taking possession of homes to sell them, according to dozens of court proceedings, as well as interviews with borrowers and housing advocates. In a statement, Caliber Home Loans, Lone Starâ€™s mortgage servicing subsidiary, said that â€œmodifying a nonperforming loan for a borrower is almost always the most profitable option for a lender, and Caliber is incentivized to pursue that outcome. â€ Yet Lone Star and Caliber have foreclosed on more than 14 percent of the 17, 000 loans the firm picked up at auction from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2014, according to an analysis of loan filings that RealtyTrac performed for The Times. Caliber is now moving toward foreclosing on at least another 3, 200. Some critics say the government is partly to blame by not expressly requiring private buyers to modify most loans. Its priority, these critics argue, was to sell off the mortgages to protect taxpayers against losses, rather than protecting homeowners. â€œI understand HUD wants to make its money back,â€ said Representative Michael E. Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat. But, he said, â€œhedge funds and private equity firms have one interest only, and that is the bottom line. â€ Mr. Capuano is one of dozens of lawmakers who have pushed for major changes in the auctions, including greater involvement of community groups and nonprofits, which often cannot afford to bid because the government sells the loans in huge bundles. In May, in an apparent acknowledgment of the problem, a HUD spokesman said the agency was drafting rules to force investment firms to be more accommodating to borrowers. In its defense, Caliber said that 71 percent of the 17, 000 mortgages it bought in the HUD auction had already begun the lengthy foreclosure process and that more than half of the homes were vacant at the time of foreclosure. Caliber said its goal was to â€œavoid foreclosure whenever possible,â€ noting that it had done so for roughly 4, 200 homeowners in the pool of mortgages it bought from HUD. Modifications donâ€™t always save borrowers money. After filing for personal bankruptcy, Michael Rego, 51, of Yonkers, held out hope for a loan modification when JPMorgan Chase sold his delinquent mortgage to Lone Star. Last October, he received a letter from Lone Starâ€™s Caliber that began: â€œCongratulations! You are approved for a trial period plan. â€ But his hopes were dashed when it turned out that the proposed modification would actually increase his monthly payment by $500. Two months later, to add insult to injury, Mr. Rego lost his job as a marketing consultant at Citigroup. â€œI would hate to just walk away from the house,â€ said Mr. Rego, who has lived in the   home for nearly 20 years. â€œBut if I have to, I have to. â€ Caliber and Lone Star have largely opted not to participate in government programs that encourage mortgage modifications. To date, Caliber has received just $3. 3 million in payments from the Treasury Department for modifying loans in compliance with the federal Home Affordable Modification Program. Caliberâ€™s unwillingness is illustrated by two   cases in White Plains. In both cases, homeowners challenged Caliberâ€™s decision to not modify their loans. The homeowners argued that Lone Star bought the mortgages from a bank under terms that require Caliber to consider loans for the government program to help struggling borrowers. In contrast with Caliber, most banks have participated more fully in the government modification program, as has Nationstar, which has received $158 million in payments. Lone Star, led by the billionaire investor John Grayken, has expanded Caliber  â€”   which employs more than 1, 000 people  â€”   into one of the nationâ€™s   lenders. As a business, Lone Star has been a success. It has generated an average annual net return of 20 percent for investors for more than two decades. It also just completed one of the largest securitizations of nonprime mortgages since the financial crisis. In early June, the firm announced a $161. 7 million bond deal backed by mortgages underwritten by Caliber, including many loans to people who had either filed for bankruptcy or been previously foreclosed on. The escalation comes as a recent survey of housing counselors and lawyers ranked Caliber last among 11 mortgage servicers in most aspects of dealing with borrowers. And the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, opened an investigation last fall into Caliber over its handling of delinquent mortgages. Mr. Schneiderman recently expanded the investigation to include an examination of Lone Starâ€™s securitization of mortgages, including delinquent loans. The New York State Department of Financial Services is also reviewing some of Caliberâ€™s practices. â€œThese companies are pitching their models as being well aligned with home buyers, but itâ€™s hard to know if thatâ€™s true,â€ said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy for the   Center for American Progress. Inside Nationstarâ€™s headquarters on the outskirts of Dallas, government regulators made an alarming discovery  â€”   and then another one, and another. The regulators, who gathered at Nationstar in 2014 for what should have been a routine examination, found â€œinaccurate informationâ€ in customer loan files, according to confidential documents reviewed by The Times. Nationstar, which became a huge mortgage bill collector in recent years, often failed to detect these errors â€œuntil the foreclosure process is underway. â€ Some of the breakdowns, the documents said, â€œplaced consumers at significant risk of servicing and foreclosure abuses. â€ Regulators laid the blame on Nationstar, citing deficient technology and a failure to employ enough trained workers as it rapidly expanded to become the nationâ€™s   mortgage bill collector. In 2010, it ranked 18th. The examination, conducted by more than 15 states and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, showed the flaws of private equityâ€™s new role in the mortgage market. Nationstar, controlled by the Fortress Investment Group, was repeating some of the banking industryâ€™s mistakes. As new regulations prompted banks to scale back their servicing of mortgages, companies owned by private equity went on a buying spree. Private equity sensed an opportunity as the mortgage servicing business became a liability for the banks, leading Bank of America alone to reach settlements worth billions of dollars over federal accusations of using illegal foreclosure documents and unfair rejections of loan modifications. Since 2012, Nationstar has bought the rights to collect payments on more than $450 billion in mortgages, much of it from Bank of America. The previously unreported documents detailing Nationstarâ€™s 2014 examination tell the story of its expansion and the problems that followed. â€œNationstar Mortgage pursued a strategy of explosive and virtually unchecked growth, but did not put in place appropriate operational controls,â€ one regulatory memo said. Authorities are investigating Nationstar based on the 2014 examination, and it could face an enforcement action this year. Jay Bray, Nationstarâ€™s chief executive, acknowledged that â€œcandidly, we did a poor jobâ€ handling the 2014 exam. But since the exam, he said, â€œWe are proud of the work weâ€™ve done to improve the customer experience. â€ The company has invested in technology and added staff, he said. â€œDid we make mistakes? Yes. Was it a systemic problem? I donâ€™t think so,â€ he said, attributing the problems to growing pains. â€œItâ€™s really easy to play Monday morning quarterback,â€ he said. Wesley Edens, a founder of Fortress, Nationstarâ€™s private equity backer, maintains that the servicer has performed better than the banks it replaced. Since buying some of the banksâ€™ most troubled assets, Nationstar has overseen a 50 percent decline in delinquent loans, though those improvements coincided with a broader recovery in housing. â€œThank God those loans were moved from Bank of America to Nationstar, because so many borrowers were better off,â€ Mr. Edens said in an interview. (A Bank of America spokesman called the company â€œan industry leader in providing foreclosure avoidance solutions to more than 2. 1 million customers since the beginning of the crisis. â€) Mr. Edens, noting that Fannie Mae ranked Nationstar higher than its peers at preventing delinquency, encouraged The Times to contact federal authorities to verify these improvements. The authorities declined to comment. Nationstar notes that, over the last four years, it has approved more than 172, 000 loan modifications that saved homeowners an average of $380 a month. Whereas all servicers collectively rejected 69 percent of applications for the governmentâ€™s modification program, Nationstar has been more generous, rejecting 54 percent of borrowers. Nationstar also recently announced plans to rename its mortgage operation â€œMr. Cooper,â€ presenting a more   face. Even as Nationstar has shown improvements, on multiple occasions last year the company â€œwrongfully terminatedâ€ borrowers from the federal mortgage modification program, according to a published report. â€œOver multiple quarters, Nationstar is wrongfully kicking people out of the program, and thatâ€™s a real serious concern,â€ said Christy Romero, the special inspector general for the 2008 bank bailout law and the author of the loan modification report. In Phoenix, Millard and Adria Gaines struggled to modify their loan as it changed hands four times in 20 years. During a recent interview at his home, Mr. Gaines walked to his kitchen freezer, pulled out a pack of cigarettes and described how he tried for years to get Bank of America, and then Nationstar, to modify their loan. In 2014, his wife exchanged emails with a Nationstar â€œforeclosure prevention specialistâ€ who suggested she apply for a modification. After months of no change, Mrs. Gaines sent a letter detailing family misfortunes that imperiled their finances, including that her husband had been told he had acute kidney failure. About six months later, Nationstar finalized a mortgage modification for the Gaineses. But even then  â€”   reducing the interest rate to 3. 2 percent from 5. 3 percent  â€”   it was months too late to help the Gaineses avoid a second bankruptcy. Sheri Celliniâ€™s family of five loved their   home in Ashland, Ore. a small town in the foothills of the mountains. They lived there for six years until a foreclosure turned them into renters. â€œThe kids want to drive by it all the time,â€ Ms. Cellini said of the familyâ€™s old house. â€œItâ€™s an uncomfortable thing. â€ The recent history of her former home reflects private equityâ€™s new dominance. By the time their home was foreclosed on in 2013, and after the family tried in vain to lower monthly payments, the Cellinis had bounced from one mortgage firm to another. The company that oversaw their foreclosure was Nationstar. Another family took over the Cellinisâ€™ house, winning it through an online auction platform called Homesearch. That family then obtained a mortgage through a company called Greenlight Loans. The companies all have different names and different roles, but all three are essentially the same company. Homesearch and Greenlight are owned by Nationstar. The whirl of transactions illustrates how Nationstar can control nearly every stage of the mortgage process, posing potential conflicts of interest as it earns fees along the way. Nationstar collects bills and, when people donâ€™t pay, can foreclose on homes. Nationstar earns fees auctioning those homes through Homesearch. Ads on Homesearch, which is now known online as Xome. com, direct bidders to Greenlight. Nationstar can then collect on the new mortgage, bringing the process full circle. Shane Hunter, who won the Cellinisâ€™ house through Homesearch, took out a mortgage with Greenlight, even though he had been leaning toward another lender. Nationstar earned a 5 percent â€œbuyerâ€™s premiumâ€ by selling the house through its auction website, an extra $10, 450 that it rolled into the loan. As a mortgage bill collector, Nationstarâ€™s interests typically align with borrowersâ€™ because foreclosing can be far more expensive than modifying and continuing to service a loan. But because Nationstar earns fees from selling homes through its auction site, as well as making new mortgages from winning bidders, that added business may compete with the companyâ€™s interest in keeping borrowers in their homes. Mr. Bray, the Nationstar chief executive, said the company would always rather keep people in their homes. â€œWe donâ€™t make money from foreclosing on folks,â€ he said, pointing to data showing that it costs the company 10 times as much to handle a loan in foreclosure. â€œWe hate foreclosures. â€ To prevent potential conflicts, Nationstar said it keeps its servicing employees separate from the auction staff. They work in different buildings and use separate email systems, the company said. Auction sites are a driver of Nationstarâ€™s growth. From 2013 to 2015, revenue more than tripled in the unit that includes the auction platform and other services. This stands in contrast with banks, which generally do not own these types of sites. In interviews, several borrowers said that Nationstar required them to list their homes with Homesearch, even after they had found a buyer through their own real estate agent. While Nationstar argues that Homesearch helps to validate an outside offer price, homeowners and their agents complained that it could slow the sale process. â€œAny requirement to use a particular auction site, especially one affiliated with the loan servicer, raises serious concerns,â€ the Connecticut attorney general, George Jepsen, said in a statement. He is one of several state attorneys general investigating Nationstarâ€™s auction business, questioning whether it imposes unnecessary costs on consumers. The New York State Department of Financial Services is conducting its own investigation of the auction process and the potential conflicts it presents, according to a letter obtained through a public records request. The case of the Browns  â€”   the Texas couple who first fought their bank, then fought Nationstar  â€”   illustrates Nationstarâ€™s aggressiveness when selling a home through an auction site. The Browns won a temporary restraining order against Nationstar as they fought what they argued was a wrongful foreclosure. But Nationstar went ahead and listed the home for sale on Auction. com, an outside auction platform that has split fees with Nationstar. On Sept. 26, 2013  â€”   more than a week before the restraining order would expire  â€”   Nationstar auctioned off the home through Auction. com. Next, Nationstar moved the case from state to federal court, and it closed the deal before the new judge could rule. â€œThis was our first home,â€ said Ms. Brown, who ultimately lost the case after the home was sold. â€œI didnâ€™t want to give up on it. â€ To a visitor, Ruskin, Fla. a town just south of Tampa, looks like   suburbia. But to private equity, it is pay dirt. Blackstone, one of the largest private equity firms, owns 125 homes in Ruskin that it operates as rentals. The financial crisis hit Ruskin hard: Nearly 800 families lost their homes in foreclosures, according to RealtyTrac. But the town is bouncing back. Amazon has opened a giant warehouse and distribution facility in Ruskin that now employs 2, 000 people. Across America, private equity firms stormed areas like Ruskin, calculating that the decline in home prices would be relatively  . Ruskinâ€™s   economic prospects looked good. And it had many relatively newer homes, which are cheaper for a landlord to maintain. In making such a large investment in housing  â€”   $9 billion buying and renovating mainly foreclosed homes over the last four years  â€”   Blackstone effectively bet on which communities would emerge from the housing crisis as winners. It bet correctly. The firm, which now owns about 50, 000 homes in 14 markets, recently reported that the fund holding its Invitation Homes rental subsidiary has generated a 23 percent annualized return for its investors. More broadly, private equityâ€™s investment in housing helped stabilize home prices across the country. The Obama administration supported private investment in foreclosed homes, with Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, remarking in 2011 that it would â€œsupport neighborhood and home price stability. â€ Still, there has been a cost. Blackstone largely steered clear of more urban communities with older homes, which are more expensive to maintain. LuTanya Garrett, who pays $1, 395 a month for a   house that Blackstone owns in Ruskin, said she was looking for another home because of the rent. â€œI feel like if Iâ€™m going to pay rent like this, I might as well own my own home,â€ said Ms. Garrett, 47, a mother of three. Nationally, the average rent on an Invitation Homes home is $1, 605 a month. The median rent in Ruskin is $1, 452, according to Trulia, a listing service. Blackstone says 72 percent of its homes have monthly rents that are within federal affordability guidelines for the markets it operates in. Institutional investors, which collectively have bought more than 200, 000 homes across the United States, point out that the rental homes they operate are a small fraction of the more than 15 million rental homes nationwide. Most are owned by small investors. About 3 percent of Blackstoneâ€™s rental homes are leased to   tenants with federal housing subsidies known as Section 8 vouchers. The numbers are lower for most other big private equity firms. Blackstone has said it welcomes Section 8 voucher holders, if the federal subsidy is enough to cover the rent. â€œWe are proud to provide quality housing choices for working families,â€ said Claire Parker, a spokeswoman for Invitation Homes. Blackstone needs to compete for   renters to serve pension fund investors that have come to expect strong returns. And that leads private equity to focus on suburban communities with relatively few Section 8 voucher holders. Housing advocates argue that large private equity firms investing in rental housing should do more for the communities where they operate. â€œThe urban areas took a big hit, and they have stayed down,â€ said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at the Center for Community Progress, a nonprofit that advises communities on dealing with vacant and blighted homes. â€œThese firms are going into markets which would have recovered anyway. â€ There are exceptions, though. Patriarch Properties of Newport Beach, Calif. is one small private equity firm that has set up shop mainly on the South Side of Columbus, Ohio, where abandoned buildings dot the streets, some inhabited by squatters and drug users. For the most part, Columbus has rebounded from the financial crisis. Unemployment is low, and the city is home to companies like Nationwide Insurance and Huntington Bancshares. Patriarch has bought about 260 deteriorated homes on the cityâ€™s South Side, an area yet to recover, and is using a combination of investor capital and   loans from a nonprofit to rehabilitate the properties. The firm intends to rent the finished homes to residents, many with Section 8 vouchers, for $500 to $900 a month. â€We are trying to bring up an entire area,â€ said Ethan Temianka, 32, the founder of Patriarch. But there are questions over whether Patriarch can generate the hefty returns it promised investors. â€œTheir very presence is a validation that there is a renaissance in the South Side,â€ said the Rev. John Edgar, who heads Community Development for All People, a nonprofit group already rehabbing homes in Columbus. â€œBut I am not certain that in the long run the business model is viable. â€"

20832,"In â€˜Divorce,â€™ Sarah Jessica Parker Wants to Ditch Mr. Medium - The New York Times",James Poniewozik,"In 1998, playing the relationship columnist Carrie Bradshaw in â€œSex and the City,â€ Sarah Jessica Parker helped usher in HBOâ€™s golden age and define a Manhattan gilded age. So itâ€™s unavoidable to wonder if her new HBO series, â€œDivorce,â€ is â€œSex and the Cityâ€ 18 years later. It is not. Itâ€™s more like a comedy about the kind of people who once watched â€œSex and the City,â€ 18 years later: suburbanites, pushing 50, for whom the sex (at least with their spouses) is nothing to wax literary about, and the city is a long train ride away. â€œDivorceâ€ is not as   as its forebear, not as fresh in its material, and in its first outings, not as consistently funny. But it can be a caustic pleasure, a chaser, heavy on the bitters, to Carrieâ€™s fruity cosmo. Here, Ms. Parker is Frances, who, in a gender twist on the stereotypical scenario, is the one having the midlife crisis. She has a pricey house in Westchester County, two teenage kids and an office job for which sheâ€™s   a dream of opening an art gallery. (In this ambition, she is more a Charlotte than a Carrie.) She also has a hunky college professor lover, Julian (Jemaine Clement, â€œFlight of the Conchordsâ€). Francesâ€™s husband, Robert (Thomas Haden Church) seems incapable of crisis, to a fault. Heâ€™s bluff and steady, predictable down to the timing of his bowel movements. His bushy,    mustache makes him look mothballed and out of his time, like a man doing a Civil War   of himself. Robert is no Mr. Big. He is, maybe, Mr. Medium. â€œDivorceâ€ is grounded in harsh, compromised reality. In the opening shot, as Frances soberly assesses herself in the mirror  â€”   neck, chest, corners of the eyes  â€”   Ms. Parker conveys the sense of a woman who Marie Kondoed her   glasses years ago. Julian gives her, besides orgasms, the chance to be at the beginning of something again. The affair is not  â€”   at first  â€”   what drives Frances and Robert to splitsville. Rather, itâ€™s the   party for her friend Diane (Molly Shannon) who gets sloppy drunk, rummages through a drawer for a gun and fires a clumsy shot at her husband, which nearly hits Robert. Instead of bringing Frances and Robert together, the scare pushes them further into themselves. He contemplates his mortality she decides she wants out: â€œI want to save my life while I still care about it. â€ â€œDivorceâ€ was created by Sharon Horgan, writer and star of â€œCatastrophe,â€ an unromanticized romantic comedy about marriage as a messy struggle. This comedy throws that rattly engine into reverse. The process of cutting entanglements, as Frances and Robert go from confrontation to mediation to litigation, is both sad and oddly invigorating. Ms. Horgan keeps the showâ€™s sympathies complicated. Frances has fallen in love with falling out of love, and even Julian sees her decision as rash and  . Robert is the   spouse, but heâ€™s no prize himself. When he learns about the affair, he glories in having the moral high ground: â€œYouâ€™re Jesse James,â€ he blusters, â€œand I get to be Sandra Bullock!â€ Neither is above using their friends and kids as leverage. Mr. Church gets the bigger comic moments, and he delightfully plays Robert as a blunderbuss whose explosions register both his pain at losing Frances and the rigidity that lost her in the first place. Ms. Parker plays the more complex role, with more mixed results. She made audiences love Carrie for years, and her inclination is to win us over to Frances. Thatâ€™s important: You need to see that Frances believes that sheâ€™s the hero of a drama, not an antihero in a farce. But sometimes the role misses someone  â€”   like Ms. Horgan herself  â€”   who could own the characterâ€™s faults and the seriesâ€™s acid tone. Some of the problem lies in the scripts, which swing unsteadily between lacerating the couple and empathizing with them. Ideally, â€œDivorceâ€ wants to be a vicious relationship comedy that also takes its core sadness seriously. In this sense, it aims to be less like â€œSex and the Cityâ€ than like HBOâ€™s naturalistic â€œGirlsâ€ (whose producer Paul Simms serves as a showrunner). The difference, of course, is measured in years. â€œDivorceâ€ feels   in its bones, from the themes to the wintry setting to the â€™  soundtrack (Supertramp, Todd Rundgren, Climax Blues Band). Itâ€™s not going to reinvent the breakup comedy or the HBO comedy. Its goal is more modest and  : to tell one more story of two people trying to reinvent themselves."
20833,Senate Passes Bill Exposing Saudi Arabia to 9/11 Legal Claims - The New York Times,Mark Mazzetti,"WASHINGTON  â€”   A bill that would let the families of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the terrorist plot passed the Senate unanimously on Tuesday, bringing Congress closer to a showdown with the White House, which has threatened to veto the legislation. The Senateâ€™s passage of the bill, which will now be taken up in the House, is another sign of escalating tensions in a relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia that once received little scrutiny from lawmakers. Administration officials have lobbied against the bill, a view that the White House spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated after the vote. And the Saudi government has warned that if the legislation passes, it might begin selling off up to $750 billion in Treasury securities and other assets in the United States before they face a danger of being frozen by American courts. Adel   the Saudi foreign minister, delivered the warning to lawmakers and the administration while in Washington in March. Many economists are skeptical that the Saudis would deliver on such a warning, saying that a   would be hard to execute and would do more harm to the kingdomâ€™s economy than to Americaâ€™s. Questions about the role Saudi officials might have played in the Sept. 11 plot have lingered for more than a decade, and families of the victims have used various lawsuits to try to hold members of the Saudi royal family and charities liable for what they allege is financial support of terrorism. But these moves have been mostly blocked, in part because of a 1976 law that gives foreign nations some immunity from lawsuits in American courts. The Senate bill carves out an exception to the law if foreign countries are found culpable for terrorist attacks that kill American citizens within the United States. If the bill were to pass both houses and be signed by the president, it could clear a path for the role of the Saudi government to be examined in the Sept. 11 suits. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat and a sponsor of the bill, said the legislation would help the families of the victims seek justice. â€œFor the sake of the families, I want to make clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that every entity, including foreign states, will be held accountable if they are found to be sponsors of the heinous act of â€ he said shortly before the billâ€™s passage. â€œIf the Saudis did not participate in this terrorism, they have nothing to fear about going to court,â€ he said. â€œIf they did, they should be held accountable. â€ Mr. Schumer said he believed that Democrats would override a veto from Mr. Obama. He also said he believed that Saudi Arabiaâ€™s threat to pull its assets, a concern of the administration, was â€œhollow,â€ adding, â€œIt will hurt them a lot more than it hurts us. â€ Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said the legislation was written in such a way that Americans would not be subject to legal action taken by other nations. â€œI do believe that thereâ€™s going to be some saber rattling, some threats, but I think that they are hollow,â€ Mr. Cornyn said. In a move intended to address some White House concerns, the billâ€™s sponsors included a new provision that would allow the attorney general to put a hold on individual court cases if the administration can show that it is negotiating with the defendant government to resolve the claims. But a release on Tuesday from Mr. Schumerâ€™s office said the administration would need to provide details about the talks and a timetable for their resolution. Mr. Earnest said on Tuesday that White House officials would seek to negotiate with Republicans and Democrats on alternatives to the legislation that might be acceptable to the president, but he added, â€œI donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s possible at this point. â€ Earlier this month, Mr. Jubeir said during a news conference that the proposed legislation was â€œstripping the principle of sovereign immunitiesâ€ and turning international law â€œinto the law of the jungle. â€ The legislation is moving through Congress as the Obama administration considers whether to declassify a portion of a 2002 congressional investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks that cited some evidence that Saudi government officials and other Saudi citizens living in the United States had a hand in the terrorist plot. Those conclusions have yet to be released publicly, but recently the National Archives posted a separate document on its website that appears to offer a glimpse at what the   28 pages contain. The document, dated June 6, 2003, is a series of memos written by Sept. 11 commission staff members compiling numerous possible connections between the hijackers and Saudis in the United States. The document was first disclosed publicly by 28pages. org, an advocacy website devoted to pushing for the declassification of the redacted section of the congressional inquiry. The Sept. 11 commission, which began its work after the congressional inquiry, found â€œno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually fundedâ€ Al Qaeda or the   plotters. Last month, the commissionâ€™s   Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, issued a statement saying that the 28 pages â€œwere based almost entirely on raw, unvetted material that came to the F. B. I. â€  â€”   much of it ultimately deemed inconclusive by the Sept. 11 panel. â€œAccusations of complicity in that mass murder from responsible authorities are a grave matter,â€ they wrote. â€œSuch charges should be levied with care. â€"

20835,"Bhumibol Adulyadej, 88, Peopleâ€™s King of Thailand, Dies After 7-Decade Reign - The New York Times",Barbara Crossette,"King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who took the throne of the kingdom once known as Siam shortly after World War II and held it for more than 70 years, establishing himself as a revered personification of Thai nationhood, died on Thursday in Bangkok. He was 88 and one of the   monarchs in history. The royal palace said he died at Siriraj Hospital but gave no further details. King Bhumibol was a unifying figure in a deeply polarized country, and his death cast a pall of uncertainty across Thailand, raising questions about the future of the monarchy itself. The military junta, which seized power in a coup two years ago, derives its authority from the king. But the kingâ€™s heir apparent, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, seen by many as a   playboy, is not held in the same regard as his father. King Bhumibol spent most of his final years in a hospital, ensconced in a special suite. His portrait hung in almost every shop, and as his health declined, billboards proclaimed â€œLong Live the King,â€ signaling widespread anxiety about a future without him. In response, he openly fretted about the people feeling so insecure. Thais came to see this Buddhist king as a father figure wholly dedicated to their welfare, and as the embodiment of stability in a country where political leadership rose and fell through decades of military coups. His death ends a reign of 70 years and 126 days, one that few monarchs have matched for longevity. Queen Elizabeth II, by comparison, has ruled Britain for more than 64 years, having surpassed Queen Victoriaâ€™s mark in 2015. With King Bhumibolâ€™s death, she becomes the worldâ€™s   monarch. King Bhumibol (pronounced   ) was an accidental monarch, thrust onto the throne at 18 by the violent death of his older brother in 1946. He fully embraced the role of national patriarch, upholding Thailandâ€™s traditions of hierarchy, deference and loyalty. Western stereotypes of his country irked him. He disdained the Broadway musical â€œThe King and I,â€ with its roots in his grandfatherâ€™s court. And, like a stern father, he was quick to chastise his fellow Thais when he saw the need. In the kingâ€™s own book â€œThe Story of Tongdaengâ€ (2002) about a street dog he had adopted, the message  â€”   there was always a message in his writings  â€”   was that affluent Thais should stop buying expensive foreign breeds when there were so many local strays to save. The book was a Thai  . If he was a peopleâ€™s king, Bhumibol was a quiet and somewhat aloof one. He was a man of sober, serious mien, often isolated in his palaces, protected by the most stringent of   laws, which effectively prevent almost any public discussion of the royal family. But he had a worldly bent. Born in Cambridge, Mass. where his father was a student at Harvard, he was educated in Switzerland, spoke impeccable English and French, composed music, played jazz on the clarinet and saxophone, wrote, painted, took up photography and spent hours in a greenhouse at his Chitrlada Palace in Bangkok. Once he had returned from Europe, however, he stayed put. Never interested in a   life, he stopped traveling abroad, saying there was too much to do at home. He was content to trudge through croplands in distant provinces in an   shirt and sport coat, tending to the many development projects he encouraged and oversaw:   plants, dams that watered rice fields, factories that recycled   stalks and water hyacinths into fuel, and countless others. In a political crisis, Thais admired him for his shrewd sense of when to intervene  â€”   sometimes with only a gesture  â€”   to defuse it, even though he had only a limited constitutional role and no direct political power. â€œWe are fighting in our own house,â€ he scolded two warring politicians he had summoned to sit abjectly at his feet in 1992. â€œIt is useless to live on burned ruins. â€ Eleven years earlier, he had aborted a coup by simply inviting the besieged prime minister, Prem Tinsulanonda, to stay at a royal palace with the king and queen. Thailand was transformed during his reign, moving from a mostly agricultural economy to a modern one of industry and commerce and a growing middle class. He presided over an expansion of democratic processes, though it was halting. He witnessed a dozen successful military coups and several attempted uprisings, and in his last years, his health failing, he appeared powerless to stem sometimes violent demonstrations, offering only vague appeals for unity and giving royal endorsement to two coups. Meanwhile a strain of republicanism emerged as the country broke into two camps: on one side, the establishment, with the palace at its core on the other, the disenfranchised, whose demand for a political voice threatened the traditional order. Between them was the king, a calming symbol of unity  â€”   so much so that at times he wanted to moderate the countryâ€™s almost obsessive veneration of him. In his annual birthday address in December 2001, King Bhumibol said, â€œThere is an English saying that the king is always happy, or â€˜happy as the kingâ€™  â€”   which is not true at all. â€ In his birthday speech in 2005, he said the belief that the king can do no wrong was â€œvery much an insult to the king. â€ â€œWhy is it that the king can do no wrong?â€ he asked. â€œThis shows they do not regard the king as being a human. But the king can do wrong. â€ Bhumibol Adulyadej was born in Cambridge on Dec. 5, 1927, the son of Prince Mahidol of Songkhla, a founder of modern medicine in Thailand the prince was studying public health at Harvard at the time. Bhumibolâ€™s mother, Princess Sangwalya Chukramol, was a Thai nurse studying on a scholarship at Simmons College in Boston when she met the prince. Bhumibol had an older brother, Ananda, and a sister, Galyani Vadhana. Bhumibol and his father were inheritors of the reformist tradition begun by King Mongkut in the 19th century and accelerated by his son King Chulalongkorn, Bhumibolâ€™s grandfather. Mongkut and Chulalongkorn were the king and prince in â€œAnna and the King of Siam,â€ Margaret Landonâ€™s 1943 novel, which was based on the autobiographical writings of Anna Leonowens. The novel inspired the musical â€œThe King and Iâ€ and its film adaptation. Bhumibol was 2 when his father died, and his mother, to whom he was very close, took her children to Switzerland for schooling. Their family life was interrupted in 1935 when Thailandâ€™s last absolute king, Prajadhipok, Prince Mahidolâ€™s half brother, abdicated after a military coup. The crown passed to Prince Mahidolâ€™s eldest son, Prince Ananda, then 10 years old. King Ananda was barely into his 20s when, on June 9, 1946, he was found dead in his private chambers with a bullet through his head. Bhumibol was the last family member to have seen him alive, but he never spoke publicly about the death or about rumors that the young king, a gun collector, may have committed suicide or killed himself accidentally. Bhumibol, though not originally in the line of succession, was anointed king. He soon returned to Switzerland for a few years and studied politics and history at the University of Lausanne. While on a trip to Paris, he met Sirikit Kitiyakara, whose father, a Thai prince, was serving as a diplomat in Europe. They married in 1950, the year King Bhumibol was formally crowned Rama IX of the Chakri dynasty. In an interview with The New York Times in 1988, the first he gave to a Western newspaper, King Bhumibol spoke with some bitterness of his early reign. He was repeatedly silenced by the military when he tried to assert himself, he said, and so decided to focus on what he could do best within his limited rights. That led to his concentration on industrial and agricultural development, an area in which the military could not challenge him without further undermining its increasingly shaky popular support. King Bhumibol began systematically building a following across the Thai political spectrum, down to the village level. It was a strategy emulated in neighboring Cambodia by Norodom Sihanouk, another Asian monarch who held the devotion of a nation through years of turmoil. David K. Wyatt, the author of the classic 1982 book â€œThailand: A Short History,â€ credited King Bhumibol with turning the monarchy into Thailandâ€™s strongest social and political institution. Queen Sirikit, though often ill, apparently from depression or a nervous disorder, tried to keep up with her husband as he toured the country and visited the more than 1, 200 development projects he fostered. She concentrated on reinvigorating Thai handicrafts. She and the coupleâ€™s four children survive. The eldest is the daughter Ubol Ratana, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, married an American and lived mostly in California until separating from him and returning to the fold in Thailand in 2006. The youngest, Princess Chulabhorn, has a degree in organic chemistry and was married to a Thai commoner. It was she who broke a royal silence about the health of her mother in the   by saying that Queen Sirikit, an insomniac, suffered from exhaustion. The heir to the throne, Prince Vajiralongkorn, is the only royal son. A daughter, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, never married and had devoted herself to studying the arts and helping her father with his many projects. She has for years been the most popular woman in Thailand, a quiet, personable foil to her brother. Toward the end of the kingâ€™s life, Prince Vajiralongkorn was moving to the center of public life. The military has recently sought to burnish the image of the prince, a partnership that may also have cemented the generalsâ€™ power. King Bhumibol was nearing the end of a long day of visiting projects in eastern Thailand in the summer of 1988 when he and Princess Sirindhorn agreed to be interviewed by The Times in a   chalet by a reservoir built by a donor in honor of the king. The subject turned to the legend of â€œThe King and I,â€ which had been banned in Thailand as being disrespectful to the monarchy, and to the Westâ€™s image of the glittering life of a king of Siam, embodied in the musical most memorably by Yul Brynner. â€œAt first it was all this rubbish about the half brother of the moon and the sun and master of the tide and all that,â€ King Bhumibol said in his fluent English. He said he found it â€œirkingâ€ to have to live up to legends created by Western writers. â€œThey wanted to make a fairy tale to amuse people,â€ he said, â€œto amuse people more than to tell the truth. â€ In reality, he said, his life revolved around his development projects. He said he did not care how history would remember him. â€œIf they want to write about me in a good way,â€ he said, â€œthey should write how I do things that are useful. â€"
20836,Krauthammer: Gorsuch Filibuster a â€™Totally Illogicalâ€™ Move Fueled by â€™Trump Derangement Syndromeâ€™ - Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,"On Mondayâ€™s broadcast of the Fox News Channelâ€™s â€œSpecial Report,â€ columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that filibustering Judge Neil Gorsuchâ€™s nomination to the Supreme Court is a â€œtotally illogicalâ€ move Democrats are pursuing because theyâ€™re responding to the â€œTrump Derangement Syndromeâ€ of their base.  Krauthammer said, â€œ[I]t makes no sense. Itâ€™s totally illogical if youâ€™re a Democrat. The fight is going to be over the next nominee. As you say, this nominee does not alter the balance of the court ideologically. The next very well could, whether itâ€™s a Kennedy, or a Ginsburg, or a Breyer, it could be a radical change, a   if itâ€™s a Kennedy, and that would have an effect. And youâ€™d expect the Democrats to want to save their ammunition, but they are expending it here. â€ He added, â€œI think they are, in some ways, suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, in the sense that they might not be personally deranged by his presence, but they have a base that has not recovered from the election, and they insist that anybody who represents them and does not want to face a primary fight, or have a demonstration outside their house on a weekend, is  â€”   will oppose what Trump is doing. This is about Trump. It isnâ€™t about Gorsuch.

20838,What Happened to the FBI?,Andrew Napolitano,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
When FBI Director James Comey announced on July 5 that the Department of Justice would not seek the indictment of Hillary Clinton for failure to safeguard state secrets related to her email use while she was secretary of state, he both jumped the gun and set in motion a series of events that surely he did not intend. Was his hand forced by the behavior of FBI agents who wouldnâ€™t take no for an answer? Did he let the FBI become a political tool? 
Here is the back story. 
The FBI began investigating the Clinton email scandal in the spring of 2015, when The New York Times revealed Clintonâ€™s use of a private email address for her official governmental work and the fact that she did not preserve the emails on State Department servers, contrary to federal law. After an initial collection of evidence and a round of interviews, agents and senior managers gathered in the summer of 2015 to discuss how to proceed. It was obvious to all that a prima-facie case could be made for espionage, theft of government property and obstruction of justice charges. The consensus was to proceed with a formal criminal investigation. 
Six months later, the senior FBI agent in charge of that investigation resigned from the case and retired from the FBI because he felt the case was going â€œsidewaysâ€; thatâ€™s law enforcement jargon for â€œnowhere by design.â€ John Giacalone had been the chief of the New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., field offices of the FBI and, at the time of his â€œsidewaysâ€ comment, was the chief of the FBI National Security Branch. 
The reason for the â€œsidewaysâ€ comment must have been Giacaloneâ€™s realization that DOJ and FBI senior management had decided that the investigation would not work in tandem with a federal grand jury. That is nearly fatal to any government criminal case. In criminal cases, the FBI and the DOJ cannot issue subpoenas for testimony or for tangible things; only grand juries can. 
Giacalone knew that without a grand jury, the FBI would be toothless, as it would have no subpoena power. He also knew that without a grand jury, the FBI would have a hard time persuading any federal judge to issue search warrants. A judge would perceive the need for search warrants to be not acute in such a case because to a judge, the absence of a grand jury can only mean a case is â€œsidewaysâ€ and not a serious investigation. 
As the investigation dragged on in secret and Donald Trump simultaneously began to rise in the Republican presidential primaries, it became more apparent to Giacaloneâ€™s successors that the goal of the FBI was to exonerate Clinton, not determine whether there was enough evidence to indict her. In late spring of this year, agents began interviewing the Clinton inner circle. 
When Clinton herself was interviewed on July 2 â€” for only four hours, during which the interviewers seemed to some in the bureau to lack aggression, passion and determination â€” some FBI agents privately came to the same conclusion as their former boss: The case was going sideways. 
A few determined agents were frustrated by Clintonâ€™s professed lack of memory during her interview and her oblique reference to a recent head injury she had suffered as the probable cause of that. They sought to obtain her medical records to verify the gravity of her injury and to determine whether she had been truthful with them. They prepared the paperwork to obtain the records, only to have their request denied by Director Comey himself on July 4. Then some agents did the unthinkable; they reached out to colleagues in the intelligence community and asked them to obtain Clintonâ€™s medical records so they could show them to Comey. We know that the National Security Agency can access anything that is stored digitally, including medical records. These communications took place late on July 4. 
When Comey learned of these efforts, he headed them off the next morning with his now infamous news conference, in which he announced that Clinton would not be indicted because the FBI had determined that her behavior, though extremely careless, was not reckless, which is the legal standard in espionage cases. He then proceeded to recount the evidence against her. He did this, no doubt, to head off the agents who had sought the Clinton medical records, whom he suspected would leak evidence against her. 
Three months later â€” and just weeks before Clinton will probably be elected president â€” we have learned that President Barack Obama regularly communicated with Clinton via her personal email servers about matters that the White House considered classified. That means that he lied when he told CBS News that he learned of the Clinton servers when the rest of us did. 
We also learned this week that Andrew McCabe, Giacaloneâ€™s successor as head of the FBI Washington field office and presently the No. 3 person in the FBI, is married to a woman to whom the Clinton money machine in Virginia funneled about $675,000 in lawful campaign funds for a failed 2015 run for the Virginia Senate. Comey apparently saw no conflict or appearance of impropriety in having the person in charge of the Clinton investigation in such an ethically challenged space. 
Why did this case go sideways? 
Did President Obama fear being a defense witness at Hillary Clintonâ€™s criminal trial? Did he so fear being succeeded in office by Donald Trump that he ordered the FBI to exonerate Clinton, the rule of law be damned? Did the FBI lose its reputation for fidelity to law, bravery under stress and integrity at all times? 
This is not your grandfatherâ€™s FBI â€” or your fatherâ€™s. It is the Obama FBI.

20839,"Clubbers Lament Demise of Fabric, a â€˜Totemâ€™ of Londonâ€™s Dance Scene - The New York Times",Dan Bilefsky,"LONDON  â€”   For fans of one of Londonâ€™s most fabled nightclubs, the party is over. This week, the local authorities shut down Fabric, a nightclub that helped put the British capitalâ€™s electronic music scene on the global stage and entranced a generation of clubbers from all walks of life. The message from officials was clear: The   hedonism would no longer be tolerated. The decision by the Borough of Islington to revoke the license of the   nightclub came after the police had asked the borough council to close the venue after the deaths of two    in recent months. According to the council, both had taken MDMA, a drug better known as Ecstasy. In 2014, the police had also asked the council to review Fabricâ€™s license after the deaths of four others in the previous three years were attributed to drugs. Clubgoers, music critics and D. J. s who made their names at Fabric described the clubâ€™s demise as a blow for British culture and a threat to Londonâ€™s place as a global capital of electronic music, for which Fabric was both a laboratory and a temple. It was also seen as a death knell for nightclubs in London, where venues are already being pushed out by creeping gentrification, the lack of business from some millennials short on cash, and   local governments that are more favorable to luxury apartment buildings and shopping malls than to loud, raucous music clubs. In August 2015, the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, a group that represents owners of pubs, bars and restaurants, published figures showing that half of Britainâ€™s nightclubs had shut down since 2005, including dozens in London. The closing of the club reverberated among revelers around the world a stop at Fabric was a   on any clubberâ€™s trip to London. Several regulars, who said they viewed Fabric as a second home, gathered on the steps of the club this week, some overcome by tears. Kevin Ford, a drum and bass producer also known as DJ Hype, wrote on Twitter that he was shaken by the news. â€œFor 15 years I was privileged to be part of greatest underground club in the world, I am lost for words right now,â€ he wrote. Kate Simko, a D. J. and composer who was born in Chicago and lives in London, has been playing at Fabric for nearly a decade. She said that the closing was a huge setback for the global electronic music scene and for the local areaâ€™s cosmopolitan spirit. â€œFabric is a place where people from all   backgrounds, colors, and sexual orientations, tourists and people from finance come together next to edgy club kids in sneakers and mohawks,â€ she said. â€œElectronic music is the music of our generation, and I am devastated. Just as clubs in New York have been pushed out of the center and replaced by shopping venues and luxury apartments during the last decade, now this is happening here. â€ Fabric was one of the last megaclubs in central London. Local councils have been cracking down on   licenses as the gentrification of formerly bohemian neighborhoods like Hackney, Dalston and Shoreditch pushes the counterculture to the outer fringes of the city. Last year, an article in The Guardian lamented â€œthe slow death of British clubsâ€ and pointed to, among other things, the hysteria of overzealous authorities. Last year, the Arches, a Glasgow superclub, was closed after a woman collapsed outside. Fabricâ€™s closing also feeds into the debate about the criminalization of recreational drug use. There were questions about whether the authorities were making an unfair example of Fabric, with the clubâ€™s supporters contending that those determined to obtain drugs would find a way of using them at the club, with or without tough security checks. The problem of drug abuse has affected venues across the world, including in the United States, where security checks, free water stations,   tents and ambulances on call have become commonplace at major music festivals. In its decision to close Fabric, the Islington council said the two teenagers had been able to sneak into the club without the drugs being detected, and had also bought drugs inside the club. It criticized Fabric for having what it called â€œgrossly inadequateâ€ security. The council said that undercover police operations at the club had revealed patrons displaying symptoms such as â€œsweating, glazed red eyes and staring into space, and people asking for help. â€ Fabric said in a statement that it was â€œextremely disappointedâ€ by the decision. â€œClosing Fabric is not the answer to the   problems clubs like ours are working to prevent, and sets a troubling precedent for the future of Londonâ€™s nighttime economy,â€ it said. Cameron Leslie, the clubâ€™s   told The Guardian this week that since opening 17 years ago, Fabric had adopted a stringent safety approach, handing all confiscated drugs to the police and calling the authorities if anyone was suspected of dealing in narcotics. Hundreds from the music industry denounced Fabricâ€™s closing, and a petition to prevent its demise had more than 155, 000 signatures by Thursday. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has been pushing to make London more of a   city by opening the subway for   service on weekends, said he was â€œdisappointed. â€ Before the club was closed down, Mr. Khan had told the council that Fabric was important to a nighttime economy in London that contributed 26. 3 billion pounds, or about $35 billion, to the cityâ€™s coffers every year. â€œClubbing needs to be safe, but Iâ€™m disappointed that Fabric, Islington Council and the Metropolitan Police were unable to reach agreement on how to address concerns about public safety,â€ he said in a statement. Mazdak Sanii, chief operating officer of Boiler Room, a platform that streams D. J. sets and dance parties online, said that the consequences of the decision would ripple across the city. â€œItâ€™s a huge totem on the London   scene, the premiere destination for the worldâ€™s biggest D. J. s, and I think the closure is going to have a totally massive impact on the music scene, on dance music culture and on the   economy,â€ he said. â€œI think itâ€™s got more to do with gentrification, noise complaints and     policing than it does with public safety. Itâ€™s all a bit   apocalyptic,â€ he added, referring to Britainâ€™s vote this summer to leave the European Union. Some critics say leaving the bloc will make the country, and its culture, more  . For many, Fabric was more than just a music venue. Jacob Husley, 35, a promoter and D. J. said in May that his favorite experience there came when a Polish couple in their 70s turned up, downed a shot of tequila each,   the D. J. and danced until 5 a. m. â€œI took them upstairs to the balcony and brought them some tea  â€”   because they wanted to have tea,â€ he told The Evening Standard. â€œThey were really sweet, they were on the balcony with their hands together ballroom dancing. â€"
20840,A Hushed Departure at the Met Museum Reveals Entrenched Management Culture - The New York Times,Robin Pogrebin,"In 2010, the Metropolitan Museum of Art hired Erin Coburn away from the J. Paul Getty Museum, lauding her as its â€œfirst chief officer of digital mediaâ€  â€”   a role created and promoted by the Met director and chief executive, Thomas P. Campbell, as part of his efforts to move the museum into the 21st century. Two years later, Ms. Coburn quietly left, along with a confidential settlement from the Met. Though no clear explanation was given at the time, recent interviews with former and current staff members reveal that Ms. Coburn had long complained that she was unable to do her job effectively because of a close personal relationship between Mr. Campbell and a female staff member in her department. Mr. Campbell announced his resignation in February. And while the relationship was not the reason he left, staff members say that it contributed to a yearslong erosion of respect for his authority and judgment within the Met and that it reflects larger problems in how the institution is managed by top executives and the board of trustees. Despite its vaunted collection, prodigious $332 million budget and a board stocked with some of the countryâ€™s most powerful donors, the Met is largely run by a dozen or so executives and trustees, interviews show, with little transparency or accountability. The recent discovery of a looming $40 million deficit that forced the institution to cut staff, trim its exhibition schedule and postpone a heralded $600 million expansion are signs that the system is showing cracks. Now, details about how dysfunction in the digital media department was allowed to continue are revealing additional consequences of the Metâ€™s turning a blind eye to problems. Ms. Coburn filed a formal complaint in 2012. Met executives investigated her claims but concluded they didnâ€™t warrant action. The boardâ€™s chairman, Daniel Brodsky, and several museum executives negotiated Ms. Coburnâ€™s departure and settlement while Mr. Campbell stayed on. Yet, for many then at the Met, the results of Mr. Campbellâ€™s relationship with a member of Ms. Coburnâ€™s staff were plain. The employee had a direct line to Mr. Campbell and amassed power well beyond her rank, they say, sidelining certain colleagues as well as commanding resources and hiring outside staff members for her projects, which added costs and created infrastructure complications. Leaders of the Met board and staff knew of the relationship before Ms. Coburn was hired, and at times had urged Mr. Campbell to end it, according to several people inside the museum. Mr. Campbell and the staff member â€œhad an inappropriate relationship,â€ said Matthew R. Morgan, the general manager of the Metâ€™s website from 2006 to 2012. â€œIt was the reason I left,â€ he said. Mr. Campbellâ€™s decisions favored the â€œvanityâ€ of the staff member with whom he had close ties â€œover doing digital the right way,â€ Mr. Morgan added. This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen people during the past month, including Met trustees, senior executives, curators and former and current members of the digital staff. All expressed admiration for the museum and its acclaimed exhibitions, but many indicated concern that Met leaders would not take a hard look at themselves and find ways to change. â€œThis is not just the singular responsibility of the C. E. O. ,â€ said Reynold Levy, the former president of Lincoln Center and an expert on nonprofits, speaking generally about the Metâ€™s culture and recent struggles. â€œThe board needs to hold a mirror up to itself and assess its own performance. â€ As boards go, the Metâ€™s is high end and old school. An international jewel of the art world, the museum sits atop the hierarchy of major New York cultural institutions and a spot on its board has long been considered the pinnacle of prestige. At 101 members, the board is also unusually large, which means decisions tend to be made in committees, the most important of which are the executive and finance committees. Expectations for most everyone else are relatively simple: deep pockets, attendance at five meetings a year and a willingness to let the Metâ€™s top executives handle the details. â€œIf youâ€™re not on the executive committee, you donâ€™t know anything,â€ said a trustee, who insisted on anonymity because board members have been warned against speaking publicly. â€œYouâ€™re expected to work and give, but not to question what goes on. â€ Another trustee said, â€œFew people have spoken up in a meeting for about 40 years. â€ This   style appeared to work well enough, including throughout the   tenure of Philippe de Montebello, who retired as director in 2008, just before the financial crisis. But the world has changed for the Met since then. Corporate and government donations to cultural institutions have declined competition from contemporary art institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art has increased and the demands to reach new audiences digitally have become urgent. It was in this environment that the board promoted Mr. Campbell, a former tapestry curator who  â€”   while erudite and elegant  â€”   had never managed an institution, let alone one with 2, 200 employees. Many inside and outside the Met describe Mr. Brodsky, a real estate executive who has been chairman since 2011, as a likable but passive leader who avoids conflict and has continued the Met tradition of informing the full board of museum developments at the last minute or, in the case of the Coburn investigation, not until he learned about the impending publication of this article. Inside the Met, several top executives knew about Ms. Coburnâ€™s complaints, former employees say, including Emily K. Rafferty, then president Sharon H. Cott, the senior vice president, secretary and general counsel Debra A. McDowell, the vice president for human resources and Carrie Rebora Barratt, the associate director for collections and administration, all of whom declined to comment. But aside from Mr. Brodsky and Candace K. Beinecke, chairwoman of the boardâ€™s legal committee, other trustees were not made aware of the complaint. The Met said that this was to protect the confidentiality of the parties involved. Moreover, without the approval or knowledge of the entire board, the Met brought the full force of its resources to bear on the case, hiring an external management consultant as well as two law firms, which conducted a   investigation. Tax records show that Ms. Coburn received $183, 000 in addition to her annual salary of $166, 000 in her final year at the museum, an unusually high payment given that she had been employed for just two years. The museum would not comment on whether the size of the payment was connected to her claim or why the terms of her departure had been kept confidential. As for the staff, no one was told the real reasons for the departure of Ms. Coburn, an executive described by former colleagues as â€œvisionaryâ€ and â€œprincipled. â€ â€œTo drive someone like Erin Coburn out and see her undermined was very disconcerting to the whole department,â€ said Paco Link, the digital departmentâ€™s former general manager of creative development, who had also worked with Ms. Coburn at the Getty. The exact nature of Mr. Campbellâ€™s relationship with the staff member  â€”   whom The New York Times is not naming to protect her privacy  â€”   is not widely known, except that she became friendly with Mr. Campbell when he was chief tapestry curator and that their relationship grew closer after he became director in 2009, current and former employees say. The staff member joined the Met in 2000 and was promoted to manager of online publications in 2009. She was generally considered capable and helped develop the museumâ€™s acclaimed online timeline, as well as website programs that feature curators and artists discussing pieces in the museum. Nevertheless, her relationship with the museum director made her â€œvery hardâ€ to manage, said Morgan S. Holzer, a former project manager at the Met. Neither the staff member nor Mr. Campbell responded to requests for comment. During the past seven years, newer trustees from the business world have, by many accounts, brought a more   metabolism to the board  â€”   zeroing in on the Metâ€™s financial troubles hiring a new president and chief operating officer, Daniel H. Weiss, a former president of Haverford College, in 2015 and enlisting Boston Consulting to do one of the â€œ360 evaluationsâ€ commonly used by Fortune 500 companies to assess employees. Mr. Campbell remains director until June. Mr. Weiss, who has taken over Mr. Campbellâ€™s role as chief executive on an interim basis, is considered a leading candidate for the next director, though the Met is planning a formal search. At a recent board meeting the Met agreed to examine the job descriptions of president and director. Mr. Brodsky, in response to detailed questions from The Times, said in a prepared statement: â€œThe board is deeply committed to ensuring a professional workplace, and one that is free of favoritism of any kind. While we believe, in this case, that the board responded appropriately by ordering an investigation by independent, external experts  â€”   which concluded Ms. Coburnâ€™s complaint was without merit  â€”   there is more we can do. â€ Ms. Coburn was replaced by Sree Sreenivasan, who left in June, and then by Loic Tallon, under whom the female staff member was laid off, along with several others, in October. The current president, Mr. Weiss, said he was committed to establishing a very different management culture at the museum. â€œI know that this has been a difficult time at the Met,â€ he said in an email last week. â€œI look forward to working with my administrative and board colleagues to support a climate of candor, transparency, accountability and mutual respect. â€"
20841,"Trump: Confidence In Economy â€™Has Reached Levels Not Seen In Many, Many Yearsâ€™ - Breitbart",Ian Hanchett,"During Fridayâ€™s Weekly Address, President Trump stated, â€œConfidence in the American economy has reached levels not seen in many, many years. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly ten years last month, and we created 211, 000 new jobs. â€[Transcript as Follows:   â€œMy fellow Americans, Confidence in the American economy has reached levels not seen in many, many years. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly ten years last month, and we created 211, 000 new jobs. Our economic progress is especially good news for the millions of young Americans who, at this time of the year, are putting on a cap and gown and receiving a diploma, certificate, or commission. So important, and we are so proud of them. This weekend, I am delighted to be participating first hand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates. I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I will be away at the G7  â€”   and I look forward to that  â€”   and will be at West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy. Come to think about it, a few days later, I will actually travel to New London, Connecticut, to speak to the graduating cadets of the United States Coast Guard Academy about their new roles serving our country. So weâ€™ll be with them very shortly. To young Americans at both schools, I will be bringing a message of hope and optimism about our nationâ€™s bright future. That is a message that I want to extend to all young Americans today, especially those who are graduating this year and entering the labor force. We are also celebrating all of the Americans who learn the skills and trades that generations of workers have used to build, shape, and supply this nation. The people who construct, repair, and create with their own two hands are the people who make this nation run. And lots of those people voted for me. Thatâ€™s also why, in my Administration, I am so deeply committed to technical and vocational education. I want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages, and disappearing jobs. We are ending the sellout of American workers â€”  and lifting the burdens on American industry, manufacturing, and businesses. We are rolling back the   regulations that make it harder for companies to grow and hire in America. At the same time, we are unleashing American energy development to create thousands of new jobs on our soil and just off our shores. On trade, we have also taken historic action to protect American industry and bring back the kinds of   jobs that can support a middle class family  â€”   and in fact, most families. As a vote of confidence in these policies, business optimism is soaring and employment is rising. These are great signs for Americaâ€™s future  â€”   the future that our new graduates will play with such a critical role in shaping our world and our country. I want every young citizen  â€”   regardless of education or geography  â€”   to be able to live out their American Dreams. So to all of Americaâ€™s graduates, congratulations. And to all of Americaâ€™s youth: we are here to help create the jobs and future you deserve. The brightest days are ahead of you. And I just look forward to seeing you at the Coast Guard Academy, and at Liberty University. Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America. â€ Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
20843,Jason Miller Backs Out of White House Communications Job Under Trump - The New York Times,Michael D. Shear,"Jason Miller, who was named as White House communications director by   Donald J. Trump two days ago, has informed Mr. Trump that he will not take the job, according to a statement from Mr. Miller. In the statement, Mr. Miller said he wanted to spend more time with his family. His wife is expecting their second child in January, he said. â€œItâ€™s clear they need to be my top priority right now, and this is not the time to start a new job as demanding as White House communications director,â€ Mr. Miller wrote. A veteran of several Republican campaigns, Mr. Miller was an avid supporter of Mr. Trump, appearing regularly on television on his behalf throughout the campaign. He had been a principal spokesman during the transition period. In the statement, Mr. Miller said that Sean Spicer, who was recently named press secretary, would serve as communications director, as well."
20844,Turkish Leader Erdogan Making New Enemies and Frustrating Old Friends - The New York Times,Sabrina Tavernise,"ISTANBUL  â€”   Turkeyâ€™s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, strode onto a stage a month ago looking down upon a sea of a million fans waving red Turkish flags. They were celebrating the   conquest of Istanbul by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II, the golden moment of Turkeyâ€™s Muslim ancestors triumphing over the Christian West. â€œThe conquest means going beyond the walls that the West thought were impervious,â€ Mr. Erdogan said as the crowd roared. â€œThe conquest means a    sultan bringing Byzantium to heel. â€ The spectacle, complete with a   sky show and a   of the conquest with fireworks and strobe lights, projected an image of unity and command, of a nation marching together toward greatness, drawing on the achievements of a glorious past. But that soaring vision is being grounded by sobering realities. Mr. Erdogan, who long professed a foreign policy of â€œzero problems with neighbors,â€ now seems to be mired in disputes with just about everybody and just about everywhere. Kurdish and Islamic State militants have struck Turkey 14 times in the past year, killing 280 people and sowing new fears. The economy has suffered, too, as the violence frightens away tourists. At the same time, Mr. Erdogan has become increasingly isolated, frustrating old allies like the United States by refusing for years to take firm measures against the Islamic State. He has recently gotten serious about the militant group, but that appears to have brought new problems: Turkish officials say they believe that the Islamic State was responsible for the suicide attack that killed 44 people on Tuesday in Istanbulâ€™s main airport, a major artery of Turkeyâ€™s strained economy. He has helped reignite war with Kurdish separatists in Turkeyâ€™s southeast, and hundreds of civilians have died in the fighting, which began last summer. He alienated Moscow last fall when Turkish forces shot down a fighter jet that he said had strayed into Turkish airspace. He had grown so alone that this past week he moved to make peace deals with Russia over the jetâ€™s downing and with Israel over its killing of several Turkish activists on a   flotilla in 2010, after railing against both countries to voters. â€œI think this is an indicator of how desperate they are,â€ said Cengiz Candar, a visiting scholar at the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies. Where Mr. Erdogan once held up Turkey as a model of Muslim democracy, he now frequently attacks democratic institutions. The editor in chief of Turkeyâ€™s largest daily has fled the country, and another is on trial on charges of revealing state secrets. The president has grown intolerant of criticism, purging his oldest allies from his inner circle and replacing them with yes men and, in some cases, relatives. (His    is the energy minister.) Mr. Erdogan hints darkly in   speeches on Turkish television that foreign powers are plotting to destroy him, and he has moved from a modest house in central Ankara to a grandiose, Persian   palace on the edge of the city. Brown and pink buildings for his staff dot meticulously landscaped grounds so enormous that staff members are driven around in minibuses. Now he has set his sights on a new target: transforming Turkeyâ€™s parliamentary system of government into a presidential one, a change his critics say could soon open the door to his seizing the title of president for life. On the night of the airport bombing, the Parliament, which his party controls, worked until 5:45 a. m. to pass sweeping legislation that will help pave the way by purging hundreds of judges from Turkeyâ€™s top two courts. â€œThe ship is going very fast toward the rocks,â€ said Ergun Ozbudun, a liberal constitutional expert who once defended Mr. Erdogan. â€œPray for us. â€ The story of how Turkey, a NATO member with the   economy in Europe and a population the size of Germanyâ€™s, ended up here is as much about Mr. Erdogan as it is about the countryâ€™s unlucky geography in a convulsing Middle East. While Mr. Erdogan has seemed to have nine lives, wriggling out of every crisis, he now finds himself cornered by conflicts on many fronts, including deep divisions in his own society that he has helped create. â€œErdogan is still the most popular political leader, but there is unease in the population,â€ said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and professor at Kadir Has University in Istanbul. â€œA lot of people are thinking this is an untenable situation. â€ Mr. Erdogan, 62, is one of the most talented politicians Turkey has ever known, rising from a poor neighborhood in Istanbul to the heights of power, where he has won election after election since 2002. He succeeded where others had failed in tearing down Turkeyâ€™s rigid, classist system of government sending the meddling military back to its barracks and opening up the bureaucracy, long deeply suspicious of Turkeyâ€™s pious underclass. In his early years as prime minister, the economy soared and, as incomes rose sharply, so did his popularity. But his critics  â€”   and even some of his admirers  â€”   say he became so absorbed in battling his enemies, both real and perceived, that he lost his way. He became distracted, they say, by delusions of imperial grandeur and in the process badly damaged institutions critical for a functioning democracy. Even a former friend, who like others feared being identified, said he had known Mr. Erdogan for 40 years, but no longer recognized him. Mr. Erdoganâ€™s advisers point out that institutions like the free press and judiciary were never all that free to begin with. They say that his government has genuinely been in danger, a claim Western officials corroborate, and that changes in the judiciary aim to fix a broken system. Ilnur Cevik, one of Mr. Erdoganâ€™s chief advisers, said the rapprochement with Russia and Israel was part of a strategy to turn the page and might soon be followed by similar measures to quiet some of the storms Mr. Erdogan had raised, like the one with Egypt: Mr. Erdogan had a   with that country in 2013 over the ouster of Egyptâ€™s first democratically elected president. There was good news on the media front, too: On Thursday night, a journalist and a human rights activist were released from jail. â€œWe have to kind of change gears regarding foreign policy, regarding the press, regarding many issues in Turkey, and I think Mr. Erdogan will start doing that,â€ said Mr. Cevik, seated in a spacious palace room recently outfitted, so it smelled like the interior of a new car. â€œWe have to show our true face to the American public. We are completely misunderstood at the moment. â€ A political outsider, Mr. Erdogan helped found the Justice and Development Party, a diverse and inclusive   political machine that turned out to be very good at winning elections, not because it cheated but because its members worked hard. â€œHe really listened to his friends,â€ said Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat, another of the partyâ€™s founders. â€œHe was patient. He would consult with a rich and varied spectrum of people. When he saw violence, he knew how to step back. â€ To gain control of Turkeyâ€™s bureaucracy, Mr. Erdogan struck an alliance with an opaque religious group led by a Muslim preacher, Fethullah Gulen, filling the ranks of the police and the judiciary with its highly educated members. â€œI told him I didnâ€™t think any part of the state should be left to the control of people with a certain ideology,â€ said Mr. Firat, a Kurd who has since left the party. â€œHis answer was, â€˜We will not be harmed by those who look toward Mecca.â€™ We were not an Islamist party  â€”   we were a democratic party. But he was already drifting away. â€ That was because he could: With the military out of the picture, the major check on his power had been removed. But Islam was not his undoing. Absolute power was. As Mr. Erdogan grew more popular, winning broad pluralities and even majorities in each successive election, he began to behave with a kind of Bolshevism, believing that he was the very embodiment of the people, former officials said. Others argue that Turkeyâ€™s problems are as much about the country as they are about Mr. Erdogan. â€œWe treat Erdogan as the cause, but in some sense, he is the consequence of Turkish society  â€”   he is our creation,â€ said Hakan Altinay, the director of the European School of Politics at Bogazici University in Istanbul. â€œWe have learned that even though we have the hardware of democracy  â€”   institutions, elections  â€”   our software is not good. We are too attuned to status, too willing to submit to authority. â€ Today, many say Mr. Erdogan has simply adopted the bad habits of former Turkish leaders he came to power to defeat. He needs allies, so he has struck an alliance with the military  â€”   the chief of staff was a witness at his daughterâ€™s wedding  â€”   and extreme nationalists are now resurgent. That is deeply troubling to human rights advocates who have documented the   case of a Kurdish politician from Sirnak, Hursit Kulter, the first such disappearance since 2001. â€œErdogan today has been captured by the patriotic forces of Turkey,â€ said Dogu Perincek, the head of a nationalist political party close to the military, who was jailed for conspiring against the state but recently released. Mr. Erdoganâ€™s Achillesâ€™ heel is the economy. His voters, while loyal, care about their pocketbooks more. Incomes have stagnated in recent years, and foreign direct investment, a major indicator of economic direction, has been declining, not counting real estate purchases. â€œWe have an ulcer, not cancer,â€ Atilla Yesilada, a financial consultant in Istanbul, said of the economy. â€œBut all signs point toward sicker. â€"
20846,Exclusive-Rep. Dave Brat: RyanCare a Perverse Economic System - Breitbart,Neil W. McCabe,"Virginia Republican congressman Dave Brat told Breitbart News Saturday radio host Matt Boyle that the American Health Care Act bill written by Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) is designed to save the insurance companies, not return health insurance and health care delivery to the free market. [Brat said the speaker is worried about the insurance companies, who backed the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, because the system they created cannot be sustained because of its perverse incentives, regulations, and costs.  In addition to the flaws in the Obamacare legislation and buildout, the congressman said it is foolish to attempt a political solution to an economic problem that forces you to accommodate the needs and values of 300 million Americans  â€”   such as people in both California and Texas  â€”   at the same time. The RyanCare bill is not connected to the promises President Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, said the former head of the economic department at   College. â€œWe want Trump to be hugely successful, so we donâ€™t want to handle a bill thatâ€™s going to fail in a few years,â€ he said. â€œTrump ran on   and competition across state lines, getting the price down  â€”   the price is going up by 20 percent and the bill we are getting ready to vote on, once again, goes back and does too much emphasis on the coverage aspect,â€ he said. Focusing on coverage makes it impossible for the bill to ever work, he said. â€œFive percent of the people with   conditions, et cetera  â€”   very serious issues that every bill deals with  â€”   but five percent of the folks will cost 50 percent of the entire health care market,â€ he said. A   condition has nothing to do with insurance, because the person already had the problem, he said. â€œThat is not an insurance problem. That is a health care problem, and weâ€™ve got to fix that. For the rest of the 300 million, weâ€™ve got to design an efficient system that follows   logic, where you get to go shop. â€ Obamacare has many rules and restrictions governing how the insurance companies structure policies and run their own firms, he said. Lifting the regulatory burden on the insurance industry would free them to innovate, he said, â€œIn the current bill, Iâ€™ve asked leadership, budget committee experts: â€˜Can a young person go out and buy a health care insurance product of their choosing?â€™ The answer is no,â€ he said. The reason is that the regulations on the insurance companies require certain â€œessential health care benefits,â€ so that everyone in the country is forced to buy the same coverage, whether they need it or not,â€ Brat said. In the RyanCare bill, the individual mandate was supposed to go away, but instead, it is reconfigured as a continuing care option tied to the   condition protections, he said. Under Ryancare someone can go without insurance for 10 years and then upon learning they have cancer, sign up for â€œinsurance. â€ Brat said the only penalty would be a 30 percent surcharge upon their premiums. â€œIt is a perverse economic system. â€ The congressman said nothing makes the politics of the RyanCare bill more plain than the fact that in 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate passed a   repeal of Obamacare  â€”   when everyone knew it would be vetoed by President Barack Obama. Now with real bullets, Republicans are stepping away from repeal to put forward a RyanCare bill that preserves the structure and spirit of Obamacare. The speakerâ€™s bill is unlikely to pass the House, but even if it makes it to the Senate, it will not pass there, either, Brat said. Then, hopefully, the Republican leadership will work with Capitol Hill conservatives to craft a true repeal of Obamacare that synchs up with what Trump promised the American people, Bratt concluded."
20847,U.N. Chief Condemns Airstrike on Yemeni Funeral and Dismisses Saudi Denials - The New York Times,Nick Cumming-Bruce and Eric Schmitt,"GENEVA  â€”   The United Nations secretary general, Ban   on Monday condemned a weekend airstrike on a funeral ceremony in the Yemeni capital, Sana, as well as the   bombing campaign believed to be responsible for it. Mr. Ban said he supported demands for an international inquiry into whether the attack, which killed at least 140 people, was a war crime. â€œDespite mounting crimes by all parties to the conflict, we have yet to see the results of any credible investigations,â€ he said. â€œThis latest horrific incident demands a full inquiry. â€ Brushing aside Saudi Arabiaâ€™s initial denials of responsibility, he said reports from the site of the attack indicated that it was carried out by the   coalition. According to witness accounts cited by United Nations human rights investigators, two airstrikes struck the Al Kubra community hall in Sana, seven to eight minutes apart. It was packed with families attending the funeral of a leader of the Houthi rebel movement, which is battling the   government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi for control of the country. Many prominent military and political leaders associated with the Houthis were in the hall and were killed in the assault, the United Nations said. â€œAerial attacks by the   coalition have already caused immense carnage and destroyed much of the countryâ€™s medical facilities and other vital civilian infrastructure,â€ Mr. Ban said. â€œExcuses ring hollow given the pattern of violence throughout the conflict. Parties cannot hide behind the fog of this war. A   catastrophe is unfolding before our eyes. â€ Earlier on Monday, the United Nationâ€™s top human rights official, Zeid Raâ€™ad   called for an independent international inquiry, noting a sharp rise in civilian casualties since the collapse of Yemeni peace talks in August. At least 369 civilians have been killed or injured since the start of October, Mr. Hussein said in a statement, bringing total documented civilian deaths since the coalition entered Yemenâ€™s civil war in March 2015 to at least 4, 125 and the number of injured to 7, 207. In response to the attack on the funeral, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, widely seen as the main backers of the Houthis, issued an angry statement saying that the rebel group, which Iran refers to as the Ansarullah movement, would â€œavengeâ€ the bombing, and that the attack was â€œa U. S. Saudi, Israeli joint conspiracy. â€ The statement concluded: â€œThe glorious and sublime nation of Iran will continue to support the resistance of Muslim nations, especially the innocent people of Yemen, against the Zionist wrongdoing of House of Saud and calls all divisions of the Islamic nation to condemn the great and brutal crime in Sana and unveil the face of hypocrites who claim to be servants of the holy shrines. â€ In Yemen on Monday, a Houthi military official denied reports that the Houthis had targeted an American guided missile destroyer that came under fire on Sunday from coastal areas controlled by the rebel groups. Two missiles were fired, but they both fell into the sea, the Pentagon said. The Houthis are known to have a stockpile of various   rockets and missiles. Saudi Arabia nevertheless accuses Iran of sending missiles to the rebels, as it does to the Lebanese Hezbollah movement and to the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza. Iran denies that it has provided weapons to the Houthi rebels. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps views the United States Navy as its main opponent in the region. In August, there were multiple episodes in the Persian Gulf involving Guards Corps ships challenging American vessels. On Sunday evening, the United States destroyer Mason, while conducting routine operations in international waters, detected two missiles fired at the ship in under an hour, according to a statement from Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. He said both missiles had fallen well shy of the ship  â€”   he would not say by how much  â€”   and had caused no damage or injuries. The ship was operating in the southern Red Sea, north of Bab el Mandeb, a strait. â€œWe assess the missiles were launched from   territory in Yemen,â€ Captain Davis said."

Donald Trump will be the new President of the United States of America. The Republican won 276 electoral votes with the necessary minimum of 270 votes and he has made himself to the post of the head of the United States. 
Pravda.Ru has turned for a comment to Paul Craig Roberts who is an American economist, journalist, blogger and former civil servant. 
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that both the political establishment of both political parties and the media no longer have credibility with the American people.It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran.It also remains to be seen how the oligarchy will respond to Trump's victory. Wall Street and its agent, the Federal Reserve, can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government.With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment and obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington's orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia's border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end ofWashington's effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these implythe total defeat of the oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the oligarchy still exists and is stillpowerful.Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks tohis view, it means a big political change in Washington's EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia ofthe current EU and NATO officials would have to cease.We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliarwith the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopefulfor the changes that now have a chance. If Trump is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding Wall Street politically accountable, he could be assassinated.

20850,â€˜The Walking Deadâ€™ Is Back: 7 Questions for the Second Half Premiere - The New York Times,Jeremy Egner,"This article includes spoilers for the current season of â€œThe Walking Dead. â€ â€œThe Walking Dead,â€ which returns from its winter break on Sunday, began its seventh season with a bludgeoning for the ages, a double murder that turned the stomachs of even longtime fans inured to the showâ€™s splatter factor. It didnâ€™t get any better from there, as Rick and the Gang (along with the rest of us) endured seven more weeks of misery and subjugation by the new baddie Negan and his Saviors, before finally seeming to rebound in the midseason finale. Are our heroes ready to overthrow their tormentors? Letâ€™s consider this and several additional questions leading into Sundayâ€™s second half premiere. Glenn and Abraham were the big ones, of course. We also lost Spencer and Olivia, but they were pretty marginal. Daryl and Eugene were taken by the Saviors, but Daryl escaped. Glenn and Abrahamâ€™s brutal deaths set a gloomy tone for the first half of the season, which was primarily about Rick and friends grieving the loss and being victimized by Negan and the Saviors. We also met some new groups, and   â€¦     well, that was about it. But eventually enough was enough, and the midseason finale ended with the core good guys reuniting, determined to throw off the yoke of Savior oppression. The tagline for this half is Rise Up, so it seems like a safe bet. Perhaps the more pertinent question is, when will the revolt happen? Teasers find Rick on a diplomatic mission to bring groups like the Hilltop and the Kingdom into the effort. How long will it take to persuade them to join the fight? Hard to say. Will it all be resolved this season? Considering that Negan doesnâ€™t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, probably not. Season 7 has kicked off a new phase of â€œThe Walking Deadâ€ marked by colonies that are collaborating and clashing as civilization recreates itself in a postapocalyptic dawn. So far, in addition to the Saviors and Alexandria, weâ€™ve met the weak but industrious Hilltop, led by the sniveling Gregory the Kingdom, led by the   poser King Ezekiel and Oceanside, an   group, led by the   Natania, who hates outsiders but has lots of guns. There are also the Wolves, a murderous gang that was a real problem last season but hasnâ€™t been a factor in Season 7. So is that it? Or are there more introductions to come? Based on this seasonâ€™s general   tendencies, it seems likely. O. K. it seems very likely. The boots in question, glimpsed in the midseason finale near the pond where Rick and Aaron found supplies, could very easily belong to someone from yet another group. In the last episode, we saw Saviors tending a herd of walkers, which may or may not be the same herd the Alexandrians loosed from the quarry at the beginning of Season 6. Whatever its provenance, the swarm seems sure to come into play somehow  â€”   we all know what Chekhov said about zombie herds hanging out on the highway. Carol has been a real bummer this season, moping through her scant few scenes as people like Morgan and King Ezekiel tried to breach the antisocial cocoon sheâ€™s spun around herself. They were unsuccessful, and after sheâ€™d sufficiently healed from her gunshot wound, Carol got herself a hermitâ€™s hut on the outskirts of the Kingdom. Youâ€™ll recall that the mousy housewife turned stone killer reached a breaking point last season, and sought to distance herself from others so she wouldnâ€™t have to kill again. Carol would seem to be too intelligent to believe such a policy is possible in a lawless hellscape, but perhaps weâ€™ll learn that thereâ€™s more to it. Or maybe she just needed some me time. Maybe sheâ€™ll learn about Glenn and Abraham, and emerge from that cocoon as a battling butterfly of righteous vengeance. Whatever the case, hereâ€™s hoping she returns to the center of the show somehow, as it has suffered from the absence of both Carol and Melissa McBride, who plays her with grit and grace. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is electric in his performance, which is unfortunately also full of affected mannerisms  â€”   wild exclamations, an odd   move  â€”   that quickly grew tiresome. A big villain helps to give â€œThe Walking Deadâ€ focus, and Mr. Morgan has shown promise, so hopefully he and the writers will find the actual man behind the tics. What questions or hopes do you have for the second half of the season? Please share your thoughts in the comments."

But no matter what happens on election day (Nov. 8), Trump will not win the majority of the black vote. Many of them are expected to heed the message of president Obama who has warned that the Republican candidate will undo his administrationâ€™s legacy. But Trump â€™s messageâ€”to make America great againâ€”might still draw an unlikely group of supporters from within the black community: African immigrants. Foreign-born Africans make up a small share of the US immigrant population, but their numbers have been doubling every decade since 1970. African immigrants living in the US grew from 80,000 in 1970 to 1.8 million as of 2013, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. This group of voters say they are supporting Trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents: as the new flag bearer for conservative, traditional politics; a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness; a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the American dream; and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of Barack Obama . Despite Trump â€™s anti-immigrant rhetoric, some African immigrants have been dissatisfied with Obama â€™s middling Africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for America their own fortunes. Leading this pack is none other than president Obama â€™s Kenyan half-brother, Malik. The 58-year-old naturalized US citizen, has spoken about his own brotherâ€™s leadership as â€œdeep disappointment,â€ and said that Trump was â€œproviding something new and something freshâ€ to the American people. Some of the African Trump supporters like Malik have also voiced their concerns about the moral relativism that has pervaded US politics, from abortion rights to marriage equality, to the current debate on transgender bathroom use.

20852,2 Education Dept. Picks Raise Fears on Civil Rights Enforcement - The New York Times,Erica L. Green,"WASHINGTON  â€”   A lawyer who represented Florida State University in an explosive sexual assault case and another lawyer who during the 2016 presidential campaign accused Hillary Clinton of enabling sexual predators have been chosen for key roles in the Department of Education, raising fears that the agency could pull back from enforcing civil rights in schools and on college campuses. President Trump will nominate Carlos G. MuÃ±iz, a politically connected Florida lawyer who served as deputy general counsel to former Gov. Jeb Bush, to be general counsel to the Education Department. Mr. MuÃ±iz, a lawyer and consultant based in the Jacksonville office of McGuireWoods, is perhaps best known for representing Florida State University in a lawsuit brought by a student who accused the former star quarterback Jameis Winston of raping her in 2012. Candice E. Jackson, who represented one of the women who attended a news conference before a presidential debate in October to impugn Mrs. Clintonâ€™s treatment of sexual assault victims, announced that she will be the acting assistant secretary for civil rights. The posts are among the most high profile in the department. Staffing in the Office for Civil Rights has been a source of concern for civil rights advocates ever since the Trump administration rescinded protections for transgender students as one of its first education policy moves. A department spokesman declined to comment on Ms. Jacksonâ€™s apparent appointment, which was announced on her personal website and in a news release from Pepperdine University School of Law, where she earned a degree in 2002. In a statement, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos praised Mr. MuÃ±izâ€™s nomination, calling him a â€œtalented legal mind. â€ â€œHe will bring a tremendous amount of experience and insight to the U. S. Department of Education,â€ she said. The appointments have been met with trepidation from advocates who are anxious about the future of the Office for Civil Rights, which gained a higher profile under President Barack Obama as it focused policy as much on equity in education as on achievement. In the 2016 fiscal year, the office processed almost 17, 000 civil rights complaints  â€”   a nearly 60 percent increase over the previous year, and one of the highest   totals in the officeâ€™s history  â€”   and opened 4, 000 investigations, according to a report released in December. In the days after the Trump administration rescinded the guidelines allowing transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, representing 60 organizations, sent a letter to Ms. DeVos asking for the next head of the civil rights office to have a track record of upholding student rights, and fighting systemic and individual cases of discrimination. The coalition, which includes organizations like the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. and the National Womenâ€™s Law Center, called it â€œone of the most significant decisions you and the president will make with regard to the civil rights of the nationâ€™s students. â€ â€œWhen you put these appointments together, people have reason to pay close attention to this civil rights agenda,â€ said Fatima Goss Graves, senior vice president at the National Womenâ€™s Law Center. Mr. MuÃ±iz would advise on a broad range of policies that fall under the purview of the Office for Civil Rights, including sexual harassment and violence complaints, the mistreatment of students with special needs, school discipline disparities, and discrimination based on race, ethnicity and gender. The Obama administration issued nearly three dozen policy guidance documents. The Florida State case was a flash point for mishandlings and   of sexual assault on campus. The university settled with the accuser, paying $950, 000, but amid revelations that it barely conducted an investigation into the claims, the Office for Civil Rights started an investigation that is still open. John Clune, who represented the accuser in the Florida State case, called Mr. MuÃ±iz â€œa strong advocate and smart lawyer,â€ and said the case was better for having him work on it. â€œOne of the things I appreciated was he was approachable,â€ Mr. Clune said. â€œI felt like Carlos was somebody that we could have candid conversation with. He cared about what our positions were. â€ However, Mr. Clune said Mr. MuÃ±iz did not approve of the Office for Civil Rightsâ€™ conducting its own investigation into the matter, and he worried about a conflict of interest if Mr. MuÃ±iz was to advise on this case. Mr. MuÃ±iz referred all questions to the Education Department. Ms. Jacksonâ€™s apparent appointment is also complicated. Advocates say that while her track record shows a commitment to standing up for victims, those victims did not include those who accused Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct. â€œItâ€™s encouraging that she has experience believing survivors,â€ said Sofie Karasek, director of education at End Rape on Campus, which she helped found. However, she added, â€œfor her not to believe survivors when itâ€™s politically expedient, that raises the question of how committed you are to this issue. â€ Ms. Jackson referred questions to the Education Department because she had not started yet. In her 2005 book, â€œTheir Lives: Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine,â€ Ms. Jackson also detailed stories of women, including Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and Gennifer Flowers, who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Bill Clinton, some of them unwanted or violent."
20853,News: Office Of The Future: Researchers Predict That Over 50 Percent Of Workplace Discrimination Will Be Automated By 2040,nan,"Email 
Automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness, but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements. No matter your stance on cutting-edge technology in the office, there is no doubt that itâ€™s a swiftly approaching reality. According to a new study released by Stanford University, Americans can expect over 50 percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by 2040. 
The future is coming, and itâ€™s coming fast. 
Thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics, it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant. Whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out rÃ©sumÃ©s from people with Middle Eastern last names, trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and cost-effectiveness than human labor. 
â€œPeople think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future, when truthfully itâ€™s right around the corner,â€ said Stanford computer scientist Dr. Oliver Thorpe, who spearheaded the new study. â€œWeâ€™re already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans, and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day.â€ 
With intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable, virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities, senior citizens, and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. Within 10 years, market-available computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens. Within 15 years, roving automatons will travel about open-plan offices smacking female subordinatesâ€™ buttocks with their carbon-fiber paddle attachments, adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences. 
Some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human on-the-job prejudice, but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line. Thorpe notes that maintaining a fucked-up culture of occupational disparity is expensive, and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semi-autonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost, theyâ€™ll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide. 
Only time will tell whether or not the human workers who have so dutifully carried out discriminatory business practices for decades get laid off or reassigned, but one thing is for sure: The American office is about to look way different."

20855,U.S.-Backed Militia Opens Drive on ISIS Capital in Syria - The New York Times,Eric Schmitt,"A joint   militia has begun a new phase in the operation to dislodge the Islamic State from its stronghold in Raqqa, Syria, moving to encircle the city and largely cut off the resupply of arms, supplies and fighters, American military officials confirmed on Sunday. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said on Sunday that he welcomed the start of the militiaâ€™s operation. â€œThe effort to isolate, and ultimately liberate, Raqqa marks the next step in our coalition campaign plan,â€ Mr. Carter said in a statement. American warplanes are flying bombing missions against the Islamic Stateâ€™s â€œleadership, command and control, and resourcesâ€ in Raqqa and outside the city in support of the militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said Col. John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Baghdad. Colonel Dorrian said in an email that it might be some time before the   to   force reached Raqqa, and that the   coalition would continue to train and recruit more forces  â€”   especially Arab troops  â€”   for an eventual attack on the city. By supporting the advance on Raqqa, American officials are sweeping aside objections from Turkey and moving forward with plans to rely on a ground fighting force that includes Kurdish militia fighters in Syria. The Turkish government, which has become a complicated ally in the fight against the Islamic State, fears that aspirations for autonomy will spread among its own Kurdish population. In a move to assuage Turkish concerns, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a previously unannounced visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital, on Sunday for talks with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar, in part to consult on battle plans for Raqqa, according to General Dunfordâ€™s spokesman, Capt. Greg Hicks. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs could not be reached for comment on Sunday, but last month Ankara asked Washington to exclude the Syrian Kurdish militias from the operation to liberate Raqqa, saying Turkey was ready to provide military support. Last month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had told President Obama in a phone call that Turkey was capable of ridding Raqqa of the Islamic State by itself. Turkey wants to start the push on Raqqa after operations in Iraq, including the offensive against Mosul, have been completed, the deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference last week. France on Sunday supported the decision to begin the battle against the Islamic Stateâ€™s headquarters in Raqqa while the   offensive on Mosul is underway. â€œI believe it will be necessary,â€ the defense minister,   Le Drian, said on Europe 1 radio. United States military officials said the Raqqa operation was being undertaken in roughly three phases. Phase 1 is what the   coalition has been doing for months: conducting scores of preparatory airstrikes in and around Raqqa to knock out    and fighting positions and other assets of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. â€œThey donâ€™t have the ability to move large troop formations, large convoys, but they do have the ability to move into and out of the area,â€ Colonel Dorrian told reporters in Washington last week. â€œWhat weâ€™ve done to try to limit that is weâ€™ve conducted a lot of strikes on their favored supply routes and infiltration routes. â€ Phase 2, which the Syrian Democratic Forces announced on Sunday, is the campaign to isolate Raqqa. The aim is to cut it off from resupply with the available forces  â€”   about   of them Syrian Kurds and   Syrian Arabs, Pentagon officials say. â€œThe intent, though, is to intensify that effort, to move closer to the city, to envelop the city and then once everything is in place, to liberate it,â€ Colonel Dorrian said last week. Phase 3 will be a fight for Raqqa itself, which American officials say they hope will be conducted mostly by Syrian Arabs, given that the city is majority Sunni Arab. But Colonel Dorrian said that might not happen for some time. â€œRight now, I donâ€™t think that all the forces thatâ€™ll be involved in that liberation campaign for Raqqa are yet trained,â€ he said. Colonel Dorrian said that providing additional training to militia members who had already been involved in the fighting would take about two weeks. â€œWeâ€™ll let that play out, and weâ€™ll see how long that takes, and weâ€™ll see how many forces will be generated,â€ he said. More than 300 members of the United States Special Operations Forces are in Syria advising the   coalition forces, but Colonel Dorrian said the Syrian opposition forces would dictate the timing of the ground operations and training, and the recruitment of additional Arab troops for the recapture of Raqqa. â€œThere is an intent to enlarge the force, and in particular the Arab contingent of the force, because we do understand that Raqqa is primarily an Arab city,â€ Colonel Dorrian said. â€œWe do understand that there is a political dimension and a local acceptance dimension to this fight. â€ Senior Pentagon officials have stressed for weeks that the fight to retake Raqqa should begin soon  â€”   within weeks  â€”   to disrupt planning believed to be underway there to stage terrorist attacks on the West. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top American military commander in Iraq, has declined to name a specific threat emanating from Raqqa against Western targets but described a general â€œsense of urgency. â€ He told reporters at the Pentagon two weeks ago that it was imperative that operations to isolate the city began soon to prevent attacks on the West that could be launched or planned from the militantsâ€™ capital. General Townsend stressed that Kurdish militia fighters would be a major part of the ground force used to isolate Raqqa, despite Turkish objections. â€œWeâ€™re going to go with who can go, whoâ€™s willing to go soon,â€ he told reporters during a video news briefing from Baghdad. â€œAnd then, once we get the initial isolation in position, weâ€™ll look at how we prosecute the operation further. â€ While the Kurdish militia will make up the bulk of the operation, General Townsend said, many of the United States Special Forces troops in Syria would help recruit, train and equip local forces in and around Raqqa, predominantly Syrian Arabs. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, has acknowledged the challenges of dealing with two pivotal allies in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria who essentially loathe each other  â€”   the Turks and the Syrian Kurds. One of his main goals now, he said recently, is to maintain momentum and â€œto keep everyone moving in the right direction. â€"

20857,"DeRay Mckesson, Arrested While Protesting in Baton Rouge, Is Released - The New York Times",Yamiche Alcindor,"DeRay Mckesson, one of the best known voices for the Black Lives Matter movement, was among hundreds of people arrested at weekend demonstrations across the country. He spent 16 hours in a Baton Rouge jail cell until he was released Sunday afternoon, vowing to continue demonstrating because he was convinced that the authorities want activists to be â€œtoo afraid to protest. â€ Mr. Mckesson, in a telephone interview shortly after his release, said he believed that his arrest was unlawful and that the police unfairly conducted mass arrests while people were peacefully assembled and out of the way of traffic along a highway. In a booking record, Baton Rouge authorities said Mr. Mckesson ignored a police officerâ€™s order to stay out of the road and as a result was charged with simple obstruction of a highway of commerce. He was released on his own recognizance. On Sunday night, he was at the Triple S convenience store, where Mr Sterling was shot a week ago, and which on this night was distinctly devoid of police officers after tense protests downtown hours earlier. â€œThe police want protesters to be too afraid to protest, which is why they intentionally created a context of conflict, and Iâ€™ll never be afraid to tell the truth,â€ he said. â€œWhat we saw in Baton Rouge was a police department that chose to provoke protesters to create, like, a context of conflict they could exploit. â€ He said that officers chased several protesters and that he had retained a lawyer. He added that he and others jailed remain committed to the Black Lives Matter movement and would continue to use civil disobedience to make their points. Mr. Mckesson and several others traveled to Baton Rouge to protest the death of Alton Sterling, who was fatally shot early Tuesday. The authorities arrested more than 100 people in connection with a protest outside the cityâ€™s police headquarters, charging most of them with obstructing the road. Eight firearms were confiscated and one officer lost several teeth after he was struck by a projectile, the police said. At a news conference in Baton Rouge, law enforcement officials defended arresting people who had stepped onto a highway against police commands, saying that streets had been closed for marches elsewhere but that this was a major thoroughfare and needed to remain open. â€œWe certainly respect the right people have to gather peacefully, to protest peacefully and weâ€™re going to protect that right,â€ said Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux III of East Baton Rouge Parish. â€œAt the same time weâ€™re not going to tolerate any violence, weâ€™re not going to tolerate any lawlessness, weâ€™re not going to tolerate any destruction of property. â€ Mr. Mckesson filmed his encounter with the police using the   app Periscope. On camera, he told viewers that there was no sidewalk where they were walking. An officer could be heard shouting, â€œYou with them loud shoes, I see you in the road. If I get close to you, youâ€™re going to jail. â€ â€œI think heâ€™s talking to me, yâ€™all,â€ said Mr. Mckesson, who often wears red sneakers to demonstrations. Later, Mr. Mckesson said, â€œWatch the police, they are just literally provoking people. â€ Then, about five minutes into the broadcast, the video becomes shaky and a police officer can be heard saying: â€œCity police. Youâ€™re under arrest. Donâ€™t fight me. Donâ€™t fight me. â€ Sunday night, Mr. Mckesson said once he was taken into custody he was put in a van with dozens of others and was able to use another personâ€™s phone to text people about what happened. He was eventually taken to East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. There he was at times housed with some 50 other men who took turns sitting on packed benches and sleeping on the floor. â€œNot everybody could fit,â€ he said. â€œSome of us had to stand. I, like many other people, slept on the floor or didnâ€™t sleep at all because there just wasnâ€™t enough room. â€ After hours, Mr. Mckesson and others were then told to change into   jumpsuits and were fed a breakfast of orange juice, oatmeal and pastries. While inside, Mr. Mckesson was able to make several calls to his lawyers and friends to strategize how to be released. Mr. Mckesson, 31, a public school administrator turned activist, first gained national notice with his blunt critiques on Twitter of the police response in Ferguson, Mo. after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. He ran for mayor of Baltimore, his hometown, this year, ultimately losing the Democratic primary in April to Catherine E. Pugh."
20858,"Carrie Fisher, a Princess, a Rebel and a Brave Comic Voice - The New York Times",A.O. Scott,"Carrie Fisher was the child of a   family. â€œThe daughter of famous parents,â€ she wrote in her memoir â€œWishful Drinking,â€ which originated as a   show. â€œOne an icon, the other a consort to icons. â€ She entered popular culture as a princess in peril and endures as something much more complicated and interesting. Many things, really: a rebel commander a witty internal critic of the celebrity machine a teller of comic tales, true and embellished an inspiring and cautionary avatar of excess and resilience an emblem of the honesty we crave (and so rarely receive) from beloved purveyors of  . When I heard the news of Ms. Fisherâ€™s death on Tuesday, what immediately popped into my mind was not â€œStar Warsâ€ but â€œRosemaryâ€™s Babyâ€  â€”   that unforgettable episode from Season 2 of â€œ30 Rock,â€ in which she turns up as a legendary and colossally difficult television writer, Rosemary Howard. [ Read Carrie Fisherâ€™â€™s obituary ] Liz Lemon, the   television writer played (and created) by Tina Fey, idolizes Rosemary, seeing her as a pioneer and a spiritual mother. But even symbolic   relationships have a way of turning dysfunctional, and Liz comes to see Rosemary less as a beacon than a warning  â€”   an image of the cynical, resentful,   dingbat Liz herself might well become. Emily Nussbaum, the New Yorkerâ€™s television critic, remarked on Twitter that the episode was â€œthe     of female comedy,â€ which may actually be an understatement. The character of Rosemary Howard certainly embodies the glories and contradictions of   feminism, and Lizâ€™s ambivalence about her is a barbed and brilliant illustration of the anxieties of female comic influence. But the casting of Ms. Fisher  â€”   whose performance on the show is somehow at once wildly winking and completely    â€”   adds about 12 dimensions of meta. Anyone watching that episode will already know that Liz Lemon is a rabid â€œStar Warsâ€ fan. Her default Halloween costume is Princess Leia Organa. Later, when she wants to get out of jury duty, Liz will coil her hair over her ears and dress in a belted linen djellaba, confident that no judge would ever impanel such a cosplaying nerd. Sheâ€™s wrong about that, and also wrong to sell out her Leia devotion, treating it as a source of embarrassment rather than power and pride. The princess allows Liz  â€”   and not only Liz  â€”   to be both geek and warrior, sex symbol and samurai, free spirit and prisoner of the corporate Death Star. Liz Lemon has two mothers, both played by Carrie Fisher. That statement can stand as a fictional index of Ms. Fisherâ€™s extensive   influence. Princess Leia  â€”   now General Organa of the Rebel Alliance  â€”   will always define her as an actress, something she claimed, in a recent Rolling Stone interview, not to mind. â€œI like Princess Leia,â€ she said. â€œI like how she was feisty. I like how she killed Jabba the Hutt. â€ That feistiness has been Leiaâ€™s principal legacy, the early sign of a shift in the understanding of female heroism  â€”   and the meanings of the word princess  â€”   that has rippled through popular culture in the past 40 years. Leia is a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless   Disney princesses. She also foretold the recent, somewhat belated feminist turn in the â€œStar Warsâ€ cycle itself. All of a sudden, and at long last, Leia is not the only   heroine in the galaxy, having been joined by Rey in â€œThe Force Awakensâ€ and Jyn in â€œRogue One. â€ Ms. Fisherâ€™s legacy may rest at least as much on her literary voice, on the alter egos she created on the page, as on any character she played onscreen. She was hardly the first or the only Hollywood figure to spill the beans about sex, drugs and other   shenanigans. Nor was she unique among writers in the way she mined her own painful history of addiction and mental illness for harrowing and humorous copy. But â€œPostcards From the Edge,â€ her 1987 roman Ã  clef about a movie star named Suzanne Vale with a cocaine problem and a difficult   mom, bristles with a bravery and candor that still feels groundbreaking. She went there, long before that was a catchphrase, and before that particular there was such a crowded piece of real estate. In her Rolling Stone interview and elsewhere, Ms. Fisher liked to cite Dorothy Parker as an inspiration. She carried that tradition forward, and the frank, funny, confessionally inclined and   women who now flourish on television and in print  â€”   the list is too long they know who they are  â€”   are in her debt. â€œYouâ€™re my kid!â€ Rosemary Howard cries out to Liz Lemon. An echo of the famous assertion of paternity in the â€œStar Warsâ€ saga. And also an acknowledgment of Carrie Fisherâ€™s own undeniable status as a matriarch."

In early November, Afghan Special Forces, accompanied by American military advisers, came under intense fire during an operation to arrest Taliban commanders in Boz Qandahari, a village in Kunduz, the United States military command in Afghanistan said in a statement. They called in American airstrikes, which resulted in some of the civilian casualties. Two American soldiers and three Afghan commandos were killed, and four American soldiers and 11 commandos were wounded, the statement said. â€œRegardless of the circumstances, I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives,â€ said Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. the commander of United States forces in Afghanistan. â€œOn this occasion, the Taliban chose to hide amongst civilians and then attacked Afghan and U. S. forces. â€ â€œI wish to assure President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan that we will take all possible measures to protect Afghan civilians,â€ he added, referring to Ashraf Ghani. After the battle in Kunduz, a New York Times reporter counted 22 bodies being brought into the city on the way to the hospital there. Among them were 14 children, four women, two older men and two men of fighting age. They were accompanied by a large group of protesters from Boz Qandahari, the village that was hit. Residents of Boz Qandahari, however, said that the investigation had underestimated the number of civilians killed and that the claim of Taliban firing at the forces from their homes was not true. â€œMy father was a shopkeeper  â€”   he had a grocery shop close to our house. My brother and I were farmers. We had never had a weapon. I and no one in my family knows how to use a weapon,â€ said Mohammed Reza, 29, who lost seven family members in the bombing and was stuck in the rubble of their house for hours. â€œI lost my father, my brother, my brotherâ€™s wife, my son and three of my nephews who were between 1 and 7 years old. â€ Dad Mohammed, 45, said he was aware of at least 37 killed among his own relatives. â€œThere were no Taliban among us, there was no Taliban in our house. Except for one former Talib, who was disabled and had lost a leg and he was our cousin,â€ he said. â€œHe was killed along with his father, his wife and five children. His brother was also killed. â€ Mr. Mohammed said the Taliban stronghold in the area was obvious, but it was far from the areas that had been bombed. â€œThis was an act of oppression,â€ he said. â€œWe are also humans. It should be investigated by an international court, and we need to be compensated for our loss. â€ Kunduz is also where a United States military gunship mistakenly targeted a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in October 2015, killing at least 42 people and destroying much of the hospital."

20861,"Clinton, Trump Both Promise Hands Off Social Security","Joe Wolverton, II, J.D.","Email 
Americans reportedly favor expanding Social Security, while key members of the Republican Party are accused of wanting to let it wither. 
An article published October 28 by the Huffington Post , citing data culled from Public Policy Polling survey, reports that 72 percent of Americans support expanding Social Security benefits. 
After highlighting data that they claim prove that all Americans regardless of age and political persuasion favor increasing Social Security benefits, the article explains that this growth should be accomplished by forcing ""the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share."" 
As an attorney, I was trained to parse phrases, breaking them down into key terms and then defining those words in careful ways so as to reveal the principles and biases upon which the statutes in question reveal. 
In the case of the expansion of Social Security, the key word that jumps off the page is ""wealthiest."" 
To me, the threshold question in the analysis of this recommendation is who is to decide what level of affluence would qualify an American as being among the ""wealthiest"" who are the target of the proposed revenue-raising scheme. 
Of course, as is the case with most of these progressive plans to steal the fruits from the laborer and fence them to the ""needy"" (who, for generations, have been convinced that it is their right to receive such filched funds), there is no mention of the fairness of seizing the property of one group, which thought to prepare for their retirement, to compensate for another group's failure to do so. 
Next up on the list of terms to define is ""fair share."" 
Again, it is critical to know who is deciding what is the ""fair"" amount ""owed"" by the objects of the fleecing. 
Not surprisingly, the HuffPo article provides no answers to these key questions. It does, however, indicate how these questions would be answered by the two major party candidates for president. 
First up, Hillary Clinton. HuffPo explains the Democratic nominee's plan for taking more money from the ""wealthy"" to make up for the lack of retirement planning by the rest of us. 
""Consistent with the will of the people, Hillary Clinton has pledged to expand, never cut, Social Security,"" the article affirms. ""The Democratic Platform fully backs the same position espoused by Clinton and the American people."" 
The GOP nominee, on the other hand, hasn't signed on to steal the property of one group and give it to another, rewarding the latter's lack of planning and preparation for a pension. Here's the HuffPo portrayal of Donald Trump's take on the purportedly popular plan to expand Social Security: In sharp contrast to Clinton and the Democrats, the Republican Partyâ€™s 2016 platform advocates cutting and dismantling, through privatization, our Social Security system. Donald Trump publically [sic] states that he wonâ€™t touch Social Security, but his choice of advisors and running mate â€” not to mention his own past statements and the Platform he controlled â€” make it clear that, once in office, he would fall in line with Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker Paul Ryan, and other leaders of the Republican Party who claim that they want to â€œsaveâ€ Social Security but advocate cutting it. 
However despite HuffPo's claim to the contrary, over the course of the campaign for the White House, Trump has repeated many times that he would not touch Social Security -- much less privatize it -- revealing why the issue is called the ""third rail"" of American politics. 
The ""third rail"" analogy comes from railroad where the third rail is the middle rail that is electrified, deadly to the touch. 
In politics, then, any issue dubbed a third rail is one that is so controversial that any attempt to fiddle with it in any way would kill the politician making the ill-fated effort at change. 
Trump, in his own words, has declared his plans for Social Security should he become president. 
""They want to cut your social security, I'm not cutting your social security,â€ Trump said in Racine, Wisconsin, on April 2. 
""We're gonna save your Social Security without making any cuts. Mark my words,â€ explained Trump on a trip to Georgia in February. 
It appears, then, that neither major party candidate has any plan to eliminate this untouchable region of the soft socialism that is the economic policy of both partners in the duopoly that controls the United States. 
Whence comes the authority of Congress (or any branch of the federal government) to forcibly seize the property of workers and set up a retirement savings account on their behalf? The quick answer is the Supreme Court. 
In the case of Helvering v. Davis (1937), the Supreme Court determined that Social Security deductions from a person's wages was a constitutional exercise of the General Welfare Clause. 
As for whether that clause was meant to endow the central government with unlimited authority to tax and spend, in 1792 Congressman James Madison warned: If Congress can apply money indefinitely to the general welfare, and are the sole and supreme judges of the general welfare, they may take the care of religion into their own hands; they may establish teachers in every State, county, and parish, and pay them out of the public Treasury; they may take into their own hands the education of children, establishing in like manner schools throughout the Union; they may undertake the regulation of all roads other than post roads. In short, every thing, from the highest object of State legislation, down to the most minute object of police, would be thrown under the power of Congress; for every object I have mentioned would admit the application of money, and might be called, if Congress pleased, provisions for the general welfare. 
And so they have and there are few brave enough to oppose the perpetuation of the plan. Certainly neither the Democratic candidate for president, nor her Republican counterpart. 
How did Americans get to a place where they will be left penniless in their old age? 
The socialists, the progressives, and the politicians who pander to them, the ""stagnation of wages"" is to blame for the failure of ""American families to save even for short-term emergencies."" 
What, though, of the fact that the average American carries over $15,000 in credit card debt. What if the money paid in interest on this debt was set aside for retirement, rather than spent paying interest rates on credit card-financed consumer purchases that, truth be told, have no long-term value and in fact rob the debtor of not only his current financial health, but make his future financial health on life-support, as well? 
Moreover, consider all of the money that employess â€œcontributeâ€ to Social Security. This amount is actually twice the amount shown on pay-check stubs, since employers are required to match their employeesâ€™ â€œcontributionsâ€ with their own â€œcontributionsâ€ that are part of the cost of employing workers and (in the absence of Social Security) could be paid directly to the employees. Just imagine how big a nest egg workers could accumulate if all of the money now going into Social Security were available to them to save and invest! 
There is another proposal for how to restore the happy retirement of an increasingly elderly American population: privatization of Social Security. 
HuffPo claims that this plan would harm the poorest among us and leave them unable to support themselves in their retirement. Others insist that the poorest pensioners would be the biggest beneficiaries of the privatization of Social Security. 
Here is an analysis by the Cato Institute: By providing a much higher rate of return, privatization would raise the incomes of those elderly retirees who are most in need. Although the current Social Security system is ostensibly designed to be progressive, transferring wealth to the elderly poor, the system actually contains many inequities that leave the poor at a disadvantage. For instance, the low-income elderly are much more likely than their wealthy counterparts to be dependent on Social Security benefits for most or all of their retirement income. But despite a progressive benefit structure, Social Security benefits are inadequate for the elderly poorâ€™s retirement needs. In addition, the progressivity of Social Security is undermined by differences in life expectancy. Because the wealthy generally live longer than the poor, they receive more total Social Security payments over the course of their lifetimes. In a privatized system, an individualâ€™s benefits would not be dependent on life expectancy. Individuals would have a property right in their benefits. Any benefits remaining at their deaths would become part of their estates, inherited by their heirs. Finally, Social Security drains capital from the poorest areas of the country, leaving less money available for new investment and job creation. Privatization would increase national savings and provide a new pool of capital for investment that would be particularly beneficial to the poor. 
Financial sense of this sort would not be enough, of course, to convince the socialists to reconsider their plan to pilfer the wages of the ""wealthy"" and ""charitably"" give it to the elderly poor. 
Why? Simple. Their plan is not to take care of the poor, but rather they need to keep the poor poor in order to sell economic salvation to them every election cycle. 
Ultimately, for constitutionalists, the goal is to eliminate Social Security all together and divest the federal government of its role in retirement planning and any other activity over which the states did not grant it authority in the Constitution.

20862,Congressional Hawks Rush to Intensify War in Syria,Anonymous,"Tweet Widget by Rick Sterling 
Warmongers in the U.S. Congress -- Democrats and Republicans â€“ are in a mad dash towards war with Russia in Syria. A â€œNo Fly Zoneâ€ resolution passed the House with little debate, cloaked in â€œhumanitarianâ€ language that blames the besieged Syrian government for the totality of the deaths in the U.S.-backed proxy war. The bipartisan regime changers are desperate to complete their mission before the regime change that will occur in Washington, on January 20. Congressional Hawks Rush to Intensify War in Syria by Rick Sterling 
This article previously appeared in Dissident Voice . 
â€œ They are desperate to prevent the Syrian government from finally eliminating the terrorist groups which the West and allies have promoted for the past 5+ years.â€ 
Hawks pass HR5732 
Late in the day Tuesday November 15, Congress convened in special session. With normal rules suspended, they passed House Resolution 5732 the â€œCaesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.â€ The resolution calls for intensifying already harsh sanctions on Syria, assessing implementation of No Fly Zone in Syria and escalating efforts to press criminal charges against Syrian officials. 
HR5732 claims to promote a negotiated settlement in Syria but, as analyzed by Friends Committee for National Legislation, imposes preconditions which would actually make that more difficult. 
There was 40 minutes of â€œdebateâ€ with six representatives (Royce, Engel, Ros-Lehtinen, Kildee, Smith, and Curbelo) speaking in favor of the resolution. There were few other Congressional representatives present in Congress. The House Foreign Affairs Committee stated that the resolution was passed â€œunanimouslyâ€ without mentioning the special conditions. 
The â€œNon Controversialâ€ Resolution that could lead to World War III 
According to wikipedia â€œ Suspension of the rules is a procedure generally used to quickly pass non-controversial bills in the United States House of Representatives â€¦.such as naming Post Officesâ€¦â€ In this case, the resolution calls for evaluating and developing plans for a â€œNo Fly Zoneâ€ which is an act of war. This is obviously controversial and it seems clear the resolution should have been debated and discussed under normal rules with a normal amount of Congressional presence and debate. 
The motivation for bypassing normal rules and rushing the bill through without debate was articulated by the billâ€™s author and ranking Democrat Eliot Engel: â€œWe cannot delay action on Syria any furtherâ€¦. if we donâ€™t get this legislation across the finish line in the next few weeks, we are back to square one.â€ The current urgency may be related to the election results since Trump has spoken out against â€œregime changeâ€ foreign policy. As much as they are critical of Obama for not doing more, Congressional neoconservatives are concerned about the prospect of a President who might move toward peace and away from war. 
The Caesar Fraud 
HR5732 is titled the â€œCaesar Syria Civilian Protection Actâ€. Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Ed Royce (R-Ca) explained that the resolution is named after â€œthe brave Syrian defector known to the world as Caesar, who testified to us the shocking scale of torture being carried out within the prisons of Syria.â€ 
In reality, the Caesar story was a grand deception involving the CIA with funding from Qatar to sabotage the 2014 Geneva negotiations. The 55,000 photos which were said to show 11,000 torture victims have never been publicly revealed. Only a tiny number of photos have been publicized. However, in 2015 Human Rights Watch was granted access to view the entire set. They revealed that almost one half the photos show the opposite of what was claimed: instead of victims tortured by the Syrian government, they actually show dead Syrian soldiers and civilian victims of car bombs and other terror attacks! The â€œCaesarâ€ story, replete with masked â€˜defectorâ€™, was one of the early propaganda hoaxes regarding Syria. 
False Claims that the US has been doing nothing 
One of the big lies regarding Syria is that the US has been inactive. Royce says: 
The administration has decided not to decide. And that itself, unfortunately, has set a course where here we sit and watch and the violence only worsens. Mr. Speaker, America has been sitting back and watching these atrocities for far too long. Vital U.S. national security interests are at stake. 
The ranking Democrat Eliot Engel said: 
Four years ago I thought we should have aided the Free Syrian Army. They came to us in Washington and begged us for helpâ€¦ they were simply looking for weaponry. I really believe if we had given it to them, the situation in Syria would have been different today. 
This is nonsense. The US was actively coordinating, training and supplying armed opposition groups beginning in late 2011. When the Qadaffi government was toppled in Fall 2011, the CIA oversaw the theft of the Libyan armories and shipment of weapons to Syrian armed opposition as documented in the Defense Intelligence Agency report of October 2012. 
These weapons transfers were secret. For the public record it was acknowledged that the US was supplying communications equipment to the armed opposition while Saudi Arabia and Qatar were supplying weaponry. This is one reason that Saudi purchases of weapons skyrocketed during this time period; they were buying weapons to replace those being shipped to the armed opposition in Syria. It was very profitable for US arms manufacturers. 
Huge weapons transfers to the armed opposition in Syria have continued to the present. This past Spring, Janes Defense reported the details of a U.S. delivery of 2.2 million pounds of ammunition, rocket launchers and other weaponry to the armed opposition. 
â€œThe US has done everything short of a direct attack on Syria.â€ 
Claims that the US has been inactive are baseless. In reality the US has done everything short of a direct attack on Syria. And the US military is starting to cross that barrier. On September 17 the US air coalition did a direct attack on the Syrian Army in Deir Ezzor, killing 80 Syrian soldiers and enabling ISIS to launch an attack on the position. Claims that it was a â€œmistakeâ€ are highly dubious. 
The claims by Congressional hawks that the US has been â€œinactiveâ€ in the Syrian conflict are part of the false narrative suggesting the US must â€œdo somethingâ€ which leads to a No Fly Zone and full scale war. Ironically, these calls for war are masked as â€œhumanitarian.â€ And never do the proponents bring up the case of Libya where the US and NATO â€œdid somethingâ€: destroyed the government and left chaos. 
Congress as a Fact-Free House of Propaganda 
With only a handful of representatives present and no debate, the six Congress members engaged in unrestrained propaganda and misinformation. The leading Democrat, Eliot Engel, said â€œWeâ€™re going into the New Year 2017, Assad still clings to power, at the expense of killing millions of his citizens.â€ That number is way off anyoneâ€™s charts. 
Rep Kildee said â€œThe world has witnessed this terrible tragedy unfold before our eyes. Nearly half a million Syrians killed. Not soldiers â€“ men, women, children killed.â€ 
The official text of the resolution says, 
It is the sense of Congress thatâ€“ 
(1) Bashar al-Assadâ€™s murderous actions against the people of Syria have caused the deaths of more than 400,000 civiliansâ€¦ 
The above accusations â€“ from â€œmillions of citizensâ€ to â€œhalf a millionâ€ to â€œ400,000 civiliansâ€ â€“ are all preposterous lies. 
Credible estimates of casualties in the Syrian conflict range from 300,000 to 420,000. The opposition supporting Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates the documented 2011-2016 death toll as follows: 
killed pro Syrian forces â€“ 108,000 
killed anti government forces â€“ 105,000 
killed civilians â€“ 89,000 
In contrast with Congressional and media claims, civilians comprise a minority of the total death count and the largest casualty group is those fighting in defense of the the Syrian state. These facts are ignored and never mentioned because they point to the reality versus the propaganda narrative which allows the USA and allies to continue funding terrorism and a war of aggression against Syria. 
The Congressional speakers were in full self-righteous mode as they accused the Syrian government of â€œcommitting crimes against humanity and war crimes against civilians including murder, torture and rape. No one has been spared from this targeting, even children.â€ A naive listener would never know that the Syrian government is primarily fighting the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda including thousands of foreigners supplied and paid by foreign governments. 
The Congressional speakers go on to accuse the Syrian military of â€œtargetingâ€ hospitals, schools and markets. A critical listener might ask why they would do that instead of targeting the Al Qaeda terrorists and their allies who launch dozens and sometimes hundreds of hell cannon missiles into government held Aleppo every day. 
â€œThe White Helmets actively promote US/NATO intervention through a No Fly Zone.â€ 
The Congressional propaganda fest would not be complete without mention of the â€œ White Helmets â€œ. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said: 
â€œWe (previously) heard the testimony of Raed Saleh of the Syrian White Helmets. These are the doctors, nurses and volunteers who actually, when the bombs come, run towards the areas that have been hit in order to try to get the injured civilians medical treatmentâ€¦They have lost over 600 doctors and nurses.â€ 
This is more Congressional nonsense. There are no nurses or doctors associated with the White Helmets. The organization was created by the USA and UK and heavily promoted by a â€œ shady PR firm .â€ The White Helmets operate solely in areas controlled by Nusra and associated terrorist groups. They do some rescue work in the conflict zone but their main role is in the information war manipulating public opinion. The White Helmets actively promote US/NATO intervention through a No Fly Zone. Recently the White Helmets has become a major source of claims of innocent civilian victims in east Aleppo. Given the clear history of the White Helmets, these claims should be treated with skepticism. What exactly is the evidence? The same skepticism needs to be applied to video and other reports from the Aleppo Media Center. AMC is a creation of the Syrian Expatriates Organization whose address on K Street, Washington DC indicates it is a US marketing operation. 
What is really going on? 
The campaign to overthrow the Syrian government is failing and there is possibility of a victory for the Syrian government and allies. The previous flood of international jihadi recruits has dried up. The Syrian Army and allies are gaining ground militarily and negotiating settlements or re-locations with â€œrebelsâ€ who previously terrorized Homs, Darraya (outer Damascus) and elsewhere. In Aleppo the Syrian army and allies are tightening the noose around the armed opposition in east Aleppo. 
This has caused alarm among neoconservative lawmakers devoted to Israel, Saudi Arabia and U.S. empire. They are desperate to prevent the Syrian government from finally eliminating the terrorist groups which the West and allies have promoted for the past 5+ years. 
â€œPro Israelâ€ groups have been major campaigners for passage of HR5732. The name of Simon Wiesenthal is even invoked in the resolution. With crocodile tears fully flowing, Rabbi Lee Bycel wrote â€œ Where is the Conscience of the World? â€ as he questioned why the â€œhumanitarianâ€ HR5732 was not passed earlier. 
Israeli interests are one of the primary forces sustaining and promoting the conflict. Syria is officially at war with Israel which continues to occupy the Syrian Golan Heights; Syria has been a key ally of the Lebanese resistance; and Syria has maintained its alliance with Iran. In 2010 Secretary of State Clinton urged Syria to break relations with Hezbollah, reduce relations with Iran and come to settlement with Israel. The Syrian refusal to comply with these Washington demands was instrumental in solidifying Washingtonâ€™s hostility . 
Congressional proponents of HR5732 make clear the international dimension of the conflict. Royce explains â€œIt is Russia, it is Hezbollah, that are the primary movers of death and destructionâ€¦it is the IRGC fighters from Iranâ€. Engel echoes the same message: â€œYes, we want to go after Assadâ€™s partners in violenceâ€¦along with Iranian and Hezbollah forcesâ€. 
These statements are in contrast with the analysis of some writers who believe Israel is not deeply opposed to the Damascus government. For example, Phyllis Bennis recently wrote that belief in an â€œarc of resistanceâ€ has been â€œlong debunkedâ€ and that â€œthe Syrian regime â€¦. often plays a useful role for US and Israeli interests.â€ 
Itâ€™s remarkable that this faulty analysis continues to be propounded. In words and deeds Israel has made its position on Syria crystal clear. Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren explained in an interview: 
â€œWe always wanted [President] Bashar Assad to go, we always preferred the bad guys who werenâ€™t backed by Iran to the bad guys who were backed by Iran â€¦ the greatest danger to Israel is by the strategic arc that extends from Tehran, to Damascus to Beirut. And we saw the Assad regime as the keystone in that arc.â€ 
These statements have been fully backed up by Israeli actions bombing Syrian positions in southern Syria and providing medical treatment for Nusra/Al Qaeda and other armed opposition fighters. 
What Will Happen Now? 
If the Syrian government and allies continue to advance in Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, outer Damascus and the south, the situation will come to a head. The enemies of Syria â€“ predominately the USA, Gulf Countries, NATO and Israel â€“ will come to a decision point. Do they intervene directly or do they allow their regime project to collapse? 
HR5732 is an effort to prepare for direct intervention and aggression. 
One thing is clear from the experience of Libya: Neoconservatives do not care if they leave a country in chaos. The main objective is to destabilize and overthrow a government which is too independent. If the USA and allies cannot dominate the country, then at least they can destroy the contrary authority and leave chaos. 
What is at stake in Syria is whether the USA and allies Israel, Saudi Arabia, etc. are able to destroy the last secular and independent Arab country in the region and whether the US goal of being the sole superpower in the world prevails. 
The rushed passing of HR5732 without debate is indicative that: 
* â€œregime changeâ€ proponents have not given up their war on Syria 
* they seek to escalate US aggression. 
* the US Congress is a venue where blatant lies are said with impunity and where violent actions are advanced behind a cynical and amoral veneer of â€œhumanitarianismâ€ and crocodile tears.

20864,Six Gulf Protectors Arrested Challenging Gulf Oil Drilling,Bill Quigley,"Email 
Six Gulf Protectors were arrested outside the New Orleans office of the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management . They were taken into custody by Federal Protection Service agents of the Department of Homeland Security during an action by Nonewleases.org urging President Obama to cancel oil drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico. 
â€œWe began the event in solidarity with those from the Sioux Nation who are standing up to the Dakota Access pipeline ,â€ said Anne Rolfes of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade , one of the organizations participating. â€œAs Gulf Protectors we are calling on President Obama to live up to his climate legacy and permanently cancel future leases in the Gulf of Mexico.â€ 
The six arrested were: Alicia Cooke, Danil Faust, Alison Kalnik, Ben Quimby, Noah Rahman, and Reverend Jim Vanderweele. Booked on federal charges of obstructing an entrance to a federal building, they were advised they have to each pay a fine of $530 or go before federal court for trial. 
Alicia Cooke, a member of 350 Louisiana , explained why she was willing to be arrested. â€œTo maintain a livable climate, experts estimate that around 80% of existing fossil fuel resources must stay in the ground. At current consumption levels, we need to place an immediate moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure projects and we also must scale back on existing projects. The industry and government executives who dismiss our concerns out of hand because we drive fuel-powered vehicles or use air conditioning are missing the point. A transition to a renewable energy economy at the speed required by science will not be easy for any of us. It will take a full-hearted acceptance of climate science and an enormous collective will. But when you look at the climate math, it is quite literally our only choice.â€ 
Iris Carter of Concerned Citizens of Norco explained why she was there to protect the Gulf. â€œOil is killing people. Just look at my own family. I grew up between a Shell refinery and a Shell chemical plant and when my mother and sister got sick, the doctors asked if we lived near pollution. Itâ€™s not fair. And now people have to go and fish in the Gulf â€“ after oil companies leave all that mess. Look what they left from the spill that BP did. That was bad. And itâ€™s no better. They keep going out and drilling and spilling in our Gulf. And thatâ€™s just not right.â€ 
Cheri Fotlin of BOLD Louisiana challenged the feds for excluding the public. â€œThe head of BOEM , Abigail Hopper, had promised to come down and meet directly with our communities who continue to be adversely affected by oil production in and along the Gulf. At the last minute, she backed out. Additionally, BOEM recently stopped allowing public participation at point-of-sale lease auctions. At every turn our voices have been oppressed by this federal agency. We deserve to be heard. If she wonâ€™t come to us, then we have no choice but to go to BOEM ourselves to make our wishes known. We want protection. We want respect for our lives. No new leases, not here, not anywhere!â€ 
Four others were arrested in August at the same place and charged with state criminal trespass. Their trial is still pending. 
The group promises to return and escalate their actions to protect the Gulf."
20865,Hillary Clintonâ€™s Gun Control Agenda Exposed in WikiLeaks Emails,The Daily Sheeple,"  The Daily Sheeple 
There is no doubt about it. Hillary Clinton is after your guns. 
Brian Fallon, national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote in an email dated October 4, 2015 that Clinton intends to stop the â€œgun show loopholeâ€, meaning all private gun sales, by executive order : 
Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President â€“ universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability . 
Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold. When a lawsuit brought against these manufacturers was found to be frivolous, Clinton made a big fuss about it on Twitter: It's incomprehensible that our laws would protect gun makers over Sandy Hook families. We need to fix this. https://t.co/96uBe92wPi 
â€” Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 15, 2016 
In September 1993 during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Hillary Clinton was asked by Senator Bill Bradley if she supported a 25% sales tax on handguns and automatic weapons. She was very clear in her support of taxing guns: 
â€œIâ€™m all for that. I just donâ€™t know what else weâ€™re going to do to try to figure out how to get some handle on this violence,â€ said Clinton. â€œIâ€™m speaking personally, but I feel very strongly about that.â€ 
In another email exchange dated January 14, 2016, Clinton wrote about using racial division to further her gun control agenda by selectively ignoring occurrences of gun violence that were not racially motivated. For this reason, according to the email, the Clinton campaign did not include the story of Jordan Davis in an essay on gun violence: 
This is great. My edits are attached. The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably â€“ this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence. Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was NOT racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis. 
In another email from March 17, we see an exchange about how to attack Donald Trump and a press call with Arizona locals about gun control. When asked about an anti-gun op-ed article by the Clinton Campaign, Chairman John Podesta wrote that he fears blowback from Clintonâ€™s supporters:

20866,My Last Thoughts Before An Historic Election,Rowan Wolf,"[Graphic of Trump courtesy of Boing Boing ] Rowan Wolf, PhD Voice of Conscience A s the minutes tick down before election day 2016, I feel that I must throw in my final thoughts and feelings.
This is an historic election in so many ways. Let me point out a few: The first time that a woman was the Presidential candidate of the duopoly. The first time in the modern era when a direct member of the .01% without any knowledge or background in politics was the Presidential candidate of the duopoly. The first time that BOTH candidates were hated and mistrusted by the majority of the voting public â€“ regardless of party. 
Now that the â€˜firstsâ€™ are out of the way, let me deal with my real concerns about this election. 
We live in a time when the world is literally a political tinder box, and the United States seems bent on adding fuel and throwing Molotov cocktails all over the place. 
We live in a time when the Earth teeters on the brink of runaway climate and ecological catastrophe. We are literally at a point where most climate scientists are saying that we are near or PAST the point of no return with climate â€“ the point where we could avoid devastating, civilization destroying, extinction level event (ELE) catastrophe. Every single eco-system, and every ecological region on the planet is degraded and many are collapsing. 
This issue of the environment is deeply pertinent to the U.S. presidential election because one of the duopoly candidates rabidly does NOT â€œbelieveâ€ in global warming. In fact, this candidate wants to disband the entire Environmental Protection Agency and reverse all environmental protections â€“ from pollution to endangered species. (Frankly, this candidate wants to get rid of ALL regulations and treaties and apparently, most laws â€“ they get in the way of business). Can you guess which candidate this is? 
Video courtesy of the NY Times . 
I have watched as much of the left has joined the far right Tea Partiers and â€œalt-rightâ€ white power movement in promoting Donald Trump as the better of the two candidates for President. The â€˜Leftâ€™sâ€ argument at base is that â€œThe Establishmentâ€ is against Trump so he must be better than Hillary Clinton (who obviously represents The Establishment). The fact is that the Left is standing with those who are ideologically (supposedly) 180 o from the Left I thought I knew. 
The Left I thought I knew was anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, pro-social justice, pro-collectivity, and environmentally conscious. Yet most seem to have decided that standing with those who are white-centric, xenophobic, misogynistic, imperialistic, pro-corporate, anti-science, anti-intellectual, and anti-environmentalism, is the â€˜common groundâ€™ against The Establishment. I am sorry, but the logic eludes me. 
These same Left Trumpers argue that he is less militaristic and hawkish than Clinton, even thought Trump has said that he wants to dramatically increase the military (the only part of the government he seems to have a use for since they would be tied to his command). He wants to upgrade and USE the nuclear arsenal. His solution to ISIS (and other pesky folk in the Middle East) is to nuke them. He wants to re-take Iraq and get their oil. In fact, he thinks that we should just take over the resources wherever we want. He also wants to make Iran straighten up â€œfastâ€ (everything is going to happen â€œfastâ€) or presumably he will nuke them too. Then there is clearly a lot of money to be made in nukes and he wants to sell them to everyone. I have not found one thing that is less hawkish about Trump other than he seems to like Putin. Of course that could change on a dime if he gets pissed off at Putin. 
Trump is different than the ordinary candidate, and what he has done is step to the front of a movement. It is a movement that is now clearly fascist. Even many on the Left recognize that Trump is a fascist (there have been various comparisons to Mussolini), but there has been virtually no discussion of the movement that has not only been empowered by Trump, but is now legitimated as a political organization, part of the power structure and sitting at the table â€“ via Trump. And the racist Right (aka â€œalt-rightâ€) is well aware of it. Trump says that there will be riots if he is not elected. The implied threat is of heavily armed militias in the streets and not peaceful protestors expressing their disgust and distrust. 
I have to wonder at how the Left has changed. We have arrived at a point where the Left (reluctantly of course) stands behind a fascist (and a fascist movement) for President of the most powerful nation on the planet. Please keep that in mind. No matter the degraded economic position of the United States, we have the largest arsenal and largest military on the planet by several magnitudes. Who is elected here matters more than ANY other country on the planet. 
So I am sad, and bereft. My country is sliding into chaos. My planet is rushing towards disaster. And the people I thought stood with me have lined up behind a narcissistic, vengeful, fascist for President. 
Oh we missed the opportunity of a lifetime. The Left could have gotten behind Sanders. No he was not perfect, but he was damn well a significant move LEFT. The Left could have looked at what was happening (given the popularity of Sanders and Trump, the two perceived anti-establishment candidates) and put forward a real viable candidate â€“ Jill Stein. With the massive dislike of both Clinton and Trump, we might have actually pulled off a real coup and gotten the Greens into the White House. That ship has sailed. 
I do not support Clinton. I do not think she is a good candidate. I do think she is sane â€“ though self-serving. I do know just how much of a hawk she is, and that she is more than happy to continue the agenda that both neo-cons and neo-libs have been pushing since 2000 (if not earlier). 
Regardless of who â€œwinsâ€ this farce of an election, Trump and his version of Brown Shirts are going to be with us for a long time. I am left to wonder how the Left that risked their lives fighting Mussolini and Franco are now standing behind Trump. 
I have no illusions about the malignancy of Clinton, but I also have no illusions about the malignancy of Trump. The fact that Clinton is the Democratic candidate speaks to the fact that she puts her â€œrightâ€ to be the first woman candidate, and the first woman U.S. president, above the fate of the country speaks volumes. It was clear that if Sanders was the candidate, Trump would not even be on the radar, much less in a dead heat for the presidency. It is now known that the DNC (with the help of MSM) sunk Sanders. Of course, much of the Left had nothing but trash talk for Sanders. It is also now known that Sanders put his political position as a senator above the needs of the country and got in line behind Clinton rather than refusing to support her and jumping over to the Green Party ticket (which speaks clearly as to where the hearts of Stein and Baraka are). 
In talking and corresponding with folks on the Left, I have heard that many are not even planning to vote. This includes the authors of a number of the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump pieces. This is stunning to me and a double blow as what they are doing is purely trying to influence the votes of others. In other words, propaganda. That some of my comrades would turn their pens and efforts to propaganda to influence the votes of others, and not devote that energy to promoting real candidates for real change leaves me tremendously disillusioned about the Left and what the goal actually is. I had thought that we were aiming for a world of justice and equality, of humane treatment of all â€“ including the planet itself, of true education and intellectual development, of support for creativity and the importance of it in a healthy society. Now I find that the apparent goal is to bring down society at any cost, and surely that cost will be high for little good arises from chaos. Rather, the most self oriented and violent responses are maximized when people feel they are fighting for survival. This is not what I have spent a life time fighting for and it is not what I will fight for now. 
My voting advice is as follows: 
Find out how the vote is running in your state. If Clinton is leading by a significant margin, vote for Stein and Baraka. If there is not that margin, then vote for Clinton. We have an electoral College- not a majority vote. That puts the electoral college members in each state as the voter for each state. 
Another option is vote swapping through a system like #NeverTrump . And yes, it is legal to do this. 
Vote for the down ballot. Vote for the most progressive candidate that has any chance of winning. Why? Because if Trump wins we will need them to help stop the slide into fascism. If Hillary Clinton wins, we need them to keep her from the the continued plans of regime change. 
One thing I know for sure â€“ we have a long struggle before us to get back to the point where we can embrace the diversity and richness of our culture, and to fully address the structured inequality that is robbing us of lives and potential every day. We were obviously NOT there before this election process, and we will be a damn sight further away from it afterwards. When hate becomes socially acceptable, we are all damaged, and lessened, and all life is cheapened. 
Is this the person you want for President of the United State? Would you trust him with your life?

20867,Anonymous To Release The 33000 Deleted Hillary E-Mails Starting November 1st,nan,"Â« Previous - Next Â» Anonymous To Release The 33000 Deleted Hillary E-Mails Starting November 1st 
The Internet hacking collective Anonymous are said to be behind the enormous hack of emails relating to the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. While it has been claimed in the mainstream media that hackers from within Russia were responsible for the hack, Anonymous have declared that these suspicions are complete without merit. A source from within the group has allegedly provided proof that Anonymous are in possession of the thirty-three thousand deleted emails. It has also been said that they intend to release all of them. 
It has been claimed that the choice to release emails that would force the FBI to open a serious criminal investigation was a deliberate tactic on the part of hackers involved with the shadowy cyber-network. It is believed that the emails relate to the disgraced former politician Anthony Weiner and his sexual propositioning of an underage girl. The nature of Weinerâ€™s crime adds credence to the claims that Anonymous are behind the hack as they have a strong track record in aggressively exposing the crimes of sex offenders. 
The source has claimed that the revelations will not end with Weiner. In the week leading up to the highly contentious presidential election, more emails will be released in batches, each containing sensational details supposedly relating to the criminal activity of those within Clintonâ€™s inner circle. A sneak preview of the revelations that are to suggest that they are potential ground breaking in nature. Apparently, the group has access to documents which attest to serious criminal activities including bribes and threats to both election officials and members of the media. Sources within Anonymous have claimed that these documents will certainly lead to criminal charges being leveled against further individuals within the Democratic Party . 
The group has also given a tantalizing hint about the relationship between the Clinton Foundation, the White House and the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. It is alleged that the emails will show that the Clinton Foundation made a transfer of $1.8 billion to the incredibly wealthy country. There are also allusions to a palace being built there for a â€˜high-ranking White House official.' As the group has also claimed that the sitting president Barrack Obama will feature heavily in the upcoming emails, it has been speculated as to whether the president himself is this â€˜high ranking White House official.'

20868,Washingtonâ€™s meddling in foreign elections,Jacob Hornberger,"Washingtonâ€™s meddling in foreign elections By Jacob Hornberger Posted on November 7, 2016 by Jacob Hornberger 
As U.S. officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the U.S. presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, letâ€™s review some of the U.S. governmentâ€™s history of meddling with elections in others countries. 
1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iranâ€™s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country. 
British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country. 
To fortify the Shahâ€™s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIAâ€™s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture. 
For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that U.S. officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States. 
In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shahâ€™s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and U.S. governments that continue to exist today. 
2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to U.S. officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that U.S. officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and U.S. officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to â€œnational securityâ€ here in the United States. 
In 1954â€”one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIAâ€™s destruction of Guatemalaâ€™s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor. 
3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lumumba was elected Congoâ€™s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lumumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to â€œnational security.â€ The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lumumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lumumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office. 
4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to â€œnational securityâ€ here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chileâ€™s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a U.S. military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the countryâ€™s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead. 
The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochetâ€™s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent peopleâ€”that is, people whose only â€œcrimeâ€ was believing in socialismâ€”with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his â€œnational securityâ€ team. 
Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the U.S. government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt. 
And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the U.S. national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-U.S. dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind. 
U.S. officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the U.S. presidential election, U.S. officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

20869,Donald Trump Reacts to Egypt Ramadan Terror: â€˜The Bloodletting of Christians Must Endâ€™ - Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,"President Donald Trump strongly condemned Fridayâ€™s terrorist attack on Coptic Christians in Egypt during the first day of Ramadan. [â€œThis merciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls,â€ he said, after terrorists shot at a bus, killing at least 28 people.  Trump again criticized the â€œdepraved, twisted, and thuggish ideologyâ€ of terrorists, promising to fight on eliminating them from the world. â€œThe bloodletting of Christians must end, and all who aid their killers must be punished,â€ he said. Trump vowed that America would help defend historic Christian communities in the Middle East. â€œCivilization is at a precipice  â€”   and whether we climb or fall will be decided by our ability to join together to protect all faiths, all religions, and all innocent life,â€ he said. Earlier today, President     also responded to the attack. â€œI direct my appeal to President Trump: I trust you, your word and your ability to make fighting global terror your primary task,â€ he said."
20870,TERROR THREAT WARNING MONDAY | RedFlag News,nan,"
CBS NEWS 
NEW YORK -- CBS News has learned about a potential terror threat for the day before the election. 
Sources told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that U.S. intelligence has alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda could be planning attacks in three states for Monday. 
It is believed New York, Texas and Virginia are all possible targets, though no specific locations are mentioned. 
U.S. authorities are taking the threat seriously, though the sources stress the intelligence is still being assessed and its credibility hasnâ€™t been confirmed. Counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of abundance of caution. 
A senior FBI official told CBS News, â€œThe counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety.â€ 
Intelligence about potential threats always increases during holiday seasons and when big events are approaching. 
As Election Day nears, federal law enforcement is planning for several worst-case scenarios. 
Earlier this week, an alert warned local police of â€œpolling placesâ€ being seen as â€œattractive targetsâ€ for â€œlone wolfâ€-type attacks by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity. "
20871,Germany Bans Cultivation of GM Crops Under EU Opt-Out Law,Christina Sarich,"The Netherlands 
Poland 
Germanyâ€™s GM ban is significant considering that biotech industry representatives have been trying to keep their stranglehold on the genetically modified crop market in the country. 
The news will likely not be taken well by DuPont Pioneer and Dow Chemical, who have been waiting for an EU executive permit for GMO cultivation in Germany and other EU countries for nearly 15 years. 
Likewise, Monsanto has criticized other member states for using their â€˜opt-outâ€™ vote to ban GMOs from their countries, stating that their decisions â€œcontradict science.â€ 
It was just over six years ago that another EU country, Hungary, strongly enforced their GM ban by destroying 1,000 acres of GM maize that had been found growing illegally. The Hungarians were the very first to take a forceful position in the European Union in relation to the use of transgenic seeds. 
Germanyâ€™s GMO ban is doubly important due to the planned merger between the Germany-based Bayer, and U.S.-based Monsanto. With ChemChina-Syngenta and DuPont-Dow Chemical forming their own multi-billion-dollar mergers, consumers and farmers still have a way to refuse genetically modified crops as they are increasingly incorporated into international treaties and trade agreements. 
As agricultural companies continue to consolidate , becoming larger and larger entities with greater capacity to lobby governments in their favor of monopolizing seed markets, the German opt-out sends a clear message to the makers of these seeds. They can grow bloated and powerful but in the end, the people will decide what they eat . 
Bill and Melinda Gates try to convince an EU country to embrace GMOs:"
20872,Men Are Binded By Their Shared Realization Of Truth,AndrÃ© du PÃ´le,"  Men Are Binded By Their Shared Realization Of Truth Men Are Binded By Their Shared Realization Of Truth 
AndrÃ© is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 18, 2016 Politics 
The 9 th of November 2016 was a great day. We will remember it as well as our parents remember the first moon landing in July 1969 or the fall of the Berlin wall. Liberal mainstream mediaâ€”almost a pleonasmâ€”are either stunned or agitating. Some of these crybullies clamour to themselves how â€œfearfulâ€ they are, lament on the â€œdestruction of the Westâ€â€”a curious expression as it seldom appears under leftist pensâ€”or have difficulties to acknowledge that the man they have despised and defamed every day for months will be the 45 th President of the United States. 
Outside the US, The Donaldâ€™s victory is creating waves, too. So many liberals allegedly connected to the Canadian Immigration website to crash it. In France, the bourgeois bohemians who work in the media, academia and everything that constitutes the big left establishment do the same posturing than their American counterparts, whereas the petits blancs (impoverished, disenfranchised whites) and local â€œrightersâ€ rejoice. 
In Brazil, where your humble servant lives, the official media is making some tedious comments that deliver a flabby criticism. Local leftist talking heads condemn the â€œ white protestants â€ and reality shows in a very clichÃ© posturing that mixes anti-white prejudice with a critique of capitalism, whereas some new traditionalists, among whom some have been avid readers and makers of Alt-Right content, are grateful . 
This is our victory. Feels good, man 
A pro-Pepe Facebook group has had a substantive discussion about where a red-pilled foreigner considering moving to the US after the Donald won should go. To make a long story short, some have advised potential newcomers to go live in the Midwest, in Texas as long as one stays away from Houston or Dallas, in Wyoming for the gun rights, in Pennsylvania excluding Philadelphia and the urban areas, close to the Appalachian mountains if one enjoys outdoors, while staying away from Illinois. Most of those who participated were whites, but I have spotted some Latino and Arab names. Some made jokes on these names but no fuss. 
And here the following question arises. What defines us? Liberals have been shrieking about â€œxenophobiaâ€ or â€œracismâ€ all the time. Yet, strictly national boundaries are much less relevant than before, even for us , even when we all rejoiced about Trumpâ€™s promise to make a wall. All over the world we are rejoicing around the GOP candidateâ€™s victory. 
American â€œTrumpistsâ€ undoubtedly feel closer to non-Americans who have been dissenting from the NWO on the Internet and wanted the Donald to pass than to American libtards. A lot of us are OK with having non-whites around: we donâ€™t pander to arrogant, aggressive anti-whites, but that does not mean we would have to be â€œracistsâ€ as the liberal caricature wants us to be. To cut in more personally, I know of no genuine red-pilled or Alt-Righter who would have rejected me as a frog, although I remember some stars and stripes cucks blaming me for daring to speak about American politics without owning a US passport. The frog is green after all 
So, once again, what defines us? Why are we a â€œweâ€? Race plays a role for sure. We struggle to keep the white people from getting dissolved into the acid bath of wide-scale miscegenation and dispossession. We want a right to solidarity based at least partly on race, i.e. on lineage and identity, just like all the pseudo-minority groups out there. We fight the double standard that allows them to be communitarian, tribalistic, nepotistic, without being ever responsible of what they do, whereas we are supposed to keep our heads down and be taught everything by liberal social engineers in a world where we would have no freedom, no future, no dignity. 
But even then, there have been Blacks, Latinos , and many women who participated into bringing The Donald to the White House. I have a race-mixed friend who supported Trump all along. This is not to say â€œIâ€™m not a racist!,â€ afraid cuckservative-style, but to show there are some and we know it firsthand. 
It is no mystery why most of us are white: we are united around a civilization that was primarily built by people of European descent. But there is more, too. 
And this â€œmoreâ€ that, I think, defines and binds us; this â€œmoreâ€ is shared awareness . On the periphery of the System centers, we managed to grow and gather 
We are all aware, broadly speaking, of the same phenomena and trends. We have witnessed the break-up of families and harmonious relationships between men and women. We have been faced with the untold prohibition to make the least critic of feminism, â€œminority groupsâ€ aggressive identitarianism, and with the pervasive omnipresence of these leftist norms commonly referred to as political correctness. We have seen neoliberalism allowing a handful of careless, irresponsible assholes sending the jobs overseas, importing third-world immigration, then force us into a life of chronic unemployment or endless struggles against other low-wage individuals for a small place under the sun. 
We saw how conservatism was a sham that never faced the genuine problems. We witnessed societies crumble, conflictual â€œminoritarianâ€ group identities being crafted by the likes of Soros, and the meritorious worker or professionalâ€”whatever his raceâ€”getting exploited to the benefit of the lower and upper parasites. We saw the liberal establishment using various social categories like pawns to create horizontal struggles and depopulation . 
Of course, some disagreements can be found on this or that particular issue, but we all see the same devastated landscape in lieu of the brilliant civilization the West once was. 
And here is the major fault line. The leftists deny or value â€”they often go from the former to the latterâ€”the replacement of native European population, the aggressive and tribalistic stance of â€œminority groupsâ€ towards the silent majority, the forced inclusion of individuals into sick identity politics games, the perpetual hostility and institutionalized prejudice against whites and malesâ€¦ Either the leftists utterly deny what we are aware of, for example when they say that whites are not under replacement, or they demonize it as a remnant of some â€œprivilegeâ€ or â€œprejudice.â€ 
All their talk about â€œoppressed minoritiesâ€ dissimulates the very real disenfranchisement of the white majority, of non-white meritorious and integrated Westerners, and serves to deny us from our rights to public empathy, to dignity, or to even basically survive in a world of our own. They work on language and representations because their job consists in manipulating these, thus brainwashing us into seeing the world through their lenses and denying the legitimacy of any other vision. 
The importance of shared awareness explains why we united on the Internet. A lot of us were closet nationalists years ago, and still are. We could not, and often still cannot, be nationalists in public, or we would have been excluded from normal social life by the local leftists and cowards. Leftist hegemony was and is still real in the mainstream. You know hegemony when you see it and spend countless hours thinking about how you can thrive even when living under it. 
In the mid-2000, I found out about the information website Fdesouche (â€œNative Frenchâ€) quote. By the standards of today, this news aggregator seems hardly interesting: it mostly collates pieces written by others. But then, it was fantastic. Here I could recognize what I already felt about the worldâ€”that something was wrong with all these non-whites thugs holding the streets and getting lavish promotion when they bragged about it. It was all concentrated before my eyes, and others were talking about what they went through daily as well. At least, others felt and saw the same as I did! I was not crazy, not bound to a life of unauthenticity or forlorn solitude among the almighty left. We were assembling. And we were on the Internet. â€œFdesouche.comâ€”The website they want to keep you from visitingâ€ 
As most of us found ourselves under attack from non-native Frenchmen, and knowing intuitively that identity goes deeper than the fleeting winds today called culture, we often despised immigration in general. But eventually things changed, thanks to Alain Soral , mostly, who emphasized how racial struggle was leading to sterile battles among disenfranchised people while letting the truly powerful off the hook. Mathias Cardet, a black journalist who worked with Soral, showed how gangsta-rap culture was injected and nurtured among non-whites by powerful interests. 
After all, one can be black or Arab and wanting to live in peace as a free individual, not as an identity politics pawn who spends his life attacking another social category. 
Being pro-white, pro-masculinity and pro-tradition does not require being white: I often felt closer from Muslims with good intentions, i.e. Muslims who were genuine believers and not rancorous people using Islam as a mask for anti-white tribalism, than from white liberals. The Muslims would not share my blood, but they would share some of my awareness and yearning for Tradition, two things that white liberals eagerly reject. â€œFaith front, warriorsâ€™ alliance against common foesâ€ 
The Internet is immaterial. It is, basically, a network where information flows. Awareness, and the will to spread it, are immaterial as well. This is why we could meet and act on the Internet. After all, the Alt Right and manosphere have been sharing ideas, media contents, memes, advisesâ€”and only later proceeded to meetups, panicking the totalitarian liberals in the process. 
Trumpâ€™s victory is a major one. Regardless of what The Donald will actually do, it is an event of considerable historical magnitude. But it is only the beginningâ€”make no mistake about that. The libtardsâ€™ establishment still holds loads of money, of institutions, of cultural territory. It has started to crumble and leak , yet it is still there. 
Major battles are waiting ahead. We have to further our awareness, make thorough research on every aspect of leftism, and develop more proper cultural references. 
Always remember the libtards never cared one second about us. They would have let us die off, alone, poor, childless, traumatized and demonized, had we not chosen to follow the path of the red pill. 
America is a first-tier power, but it is still a battlefield among others. Wherever we are, it is time to thicken our mutual relationships and cooperate more closely. It is a battle, not between nationals and foreigners, but between workers and parasites, between those who feel the void and wrongness in the rotten core of postmodernity and those who dwell in the last liberal trend, between the realists who want freedom and responsibility in a healthy world of values and cultures against those who ravel in blue pill, media bullshit, complacency, parasitism and cucking for the empire of nothing. 
We are the future. It doesnâ€™t matter where we are. We are those with true awareness, those with genuine and healthy values, those who struggled to hone their abilities, and most importantly those who actually deserve to inherit the Western world. So, save it and conquer it, country after country, institution after institution, outlet after outletâ€”or there will be nothing left."
20873,The Top Political Tweets and Hashtags of 2016 - The New York Times,Daniel Victor,"Twitter announced on Tuesday the yearâ€™s biggest trending topics and most widely shared tweets in news and politics, and while the election loomed large, several of the most popular discussions were focused on matters of identity and safety. Race relations were at the top of peopleâ€™s minds, with #BlackLivesMatter the   popular subject. Alton Sterling, a black man fatally shot by the police in Baton Rouge, La. was also in the top 10. #InternationalWomensDay gathered discussion about gender in March, while #LoveIsLove  â€”   a declaration associated with equal rights for gay people that Barack Obama used as Americans held pride parades  â€”   was popular in June. Twitter users publicly mourned   attacks with #PrayForOrlando and #PrayForNice, while discussion of Brexit, a coup attempt in Turkey and the Panama Papers also made the top 10. But #Election2016 was the leading discussion of the year and the subject of most of the most widely shared political tweets of the year. The most popular political tweet was a quote from Hillary Clintonâ€™s concession speech on Nov. 9. Ms. Clintonâ€™s tweet was the   popular tweet of the year in any subject, falling behind one by a Spanish video gamer and one from Harry Styles quoting Taylor Swift. And you thought the American election was the most interesting thing that happened this year. The   political tweet might require some explanation. During the campaign, Donald J. Trump posted a criticism of President Obamaâ€™s endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. In response, she (or, more likely, her staff) latched on to a common Twitter retort. If youâ€™re still confused, we explained the meme more fully here. Other tweets on the list were more straightforward, such as Mr. Trumpâ€™s Election Day declaration, a kind word from a vice president to his pal and an actor responding in despair to the election results. This one came from an everyday user who struck a nerve with a Google search for the name of the current president. Although Mr. Obama sent the tweet below four years ago to celebrate his   it got more than 236, 000 retweets in 2016, Twitter said. That was slightly more retweets than Mr. Trump got this year on an   tweet after winning the election. Last on the list was a tweet that found resonance among Mr. Trumpâ€™s opponents."

Trump is continuing to build his cabinet. Members of his transition effortâ€™s economic and domestic policy teams are expected to begin meeting with agency officials today. He has hinted strongly that James N. Mattis, a retired general who helped lead the 2003 invasion of Iraq, will be defense secretary. Here are the latest transition details. _____ â€¢ Mr. Trumpâ€™s meetings with business leaders since his election, including three Indian real estate executives last week, have raised questions over his conflicts of interests. The Indian business partners are building Trump Towers Pune, a luxury apartment complex south of Mumbai. _____ â€¢ Mr. Trump  used Twitter to rail at his satirists and critics in the entertainment industry.

20875,The Best Sandwich Ever - The New York Times,Sam Sifton,"â€œYour Top 5 favorite sandwiches, in order, please. Go. â€ This is a game I play in the car with my children, as if we were characters in a Nick Hornby novel. Itâ€™s a diversion to make long travel more bearable. We play it all the time. The children rush to judgment, and as is true for most of us, their answers change along with their tastes. But of late: grilled cheese on white, with tomato soup the B. L. T. from a store in Maine near their uncleâ€™s house, on thick country bread ham and Brie with mustard on baguette a meatball sub from a local deli and  â€”   does a hamburger count? (It does not.) Dadâ€™s turn. I count in reverse order: that B. L. T. yes, perhaps with avocado turkey with Swiss, coleslaw and Russian dressing on a kaiser roll peanut butter and gochujang (the Korean   paste) on sesame toast a Reuben, on rye of course, with pastrami, Swiss, sauerkraut, more of that Russian. I know a guy who makes those as if he were building violins for Pinchas Zukerman. I pause before the No. 1 slot, as if reflecting I enjoy giving this answer. My most favorite sandwich is fried eggplant, mozzarella and roast beef on an Italian hero, with hot peppers and a slash of mayonnaise. You can find that sandwich at Defonteâ€™s Sandwich Shop, on Columbia Street in Brooklyn, near the exit to the Hugh Carey Tunnel that leads from Red Hook to the Battery in Manhattan. It is a beautiful torpedo of food  â€”   crunchy, silken, sweet and spicy all at once. But be careful. It is huge and outrageously rich. If you consume it all at once, it can be the sort of sandwich to lay out the afternoon in stages of grief. Often I omit the roast beef from my order and tell myself Iâ€™ll eat only half. I always eat the whole thing and hate myself through my untouched dinner later in the day. Recently, in a fit of ambition, I set out to make the thing at home,   both the fried eggplant and the ratio of the ingredients to make it a   sandwich, the sort of meal that offers satisfaction without hurting anyone, that delivers deliciousness at a lower cost to the body that consumes it. It is still a colossal feed. It is still the best sandwich. To start, fry the eggplant. You can do this up to a day or two ahead of time. I use small Italian eggplants, eight to 10 inches in length, with dark, shiny skins, firm to the touch. You can leave the skins on, or you can peel them, as do some masters of the   game, including the Franks Castronovo and Falcinelli, of the Frankies Spuntinos restaurants in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Then I cut the eggplants into thin planks and salt them awhile, not so much because theyâ€™re bitter but because the salt draws moisture from the flesh, collapsing its cell structure and reducing the amount of oil the eggplant picks up when it cooks. Blot them well with paper towels to remove the liquid and the excess salt, and you will be good to go. The frying is serial: A first run through hot olive oil cooks the eggplant and lightly browns it a second, after the cooked eggplant has been dipped in a wash of egg and Parmesan cheese, gives it a slightly puffed crust, browned in spots, salty and oily in the best possible way. (Some old recipes for   fried eggplant call for a dip in bread crumbs following the egg, but I think this is overkill.) Let the   eggplant drain a little, and the planks will keep, lightly covered, for a few hours on the countertop or for a few days in the fridge. Theyâ€™re best at room temperature. The rest of the sandwich is shopping: Italian hero rolls, or loaves of Italian bread, as well as fresh   mozzarella (though Iâ€™ve had good results even with the   stuff from the supermarket just be sure to allow it to come to room temperature before assembling your meal). And while you can certainly make the roast beef yourself, letâ€™s not overcomplicate things youâ€™ve already fried eggplant. (Vegetarians can avoid the roast beef.) Lastly, youâ€™ll need pickled Italian hot cherry peppers, which you can slice into rounds and apply as desired. The mayonnaise is my preference. I know some people hate it. In sandwich making, form always follows function. So wherever you come down on the question of mayonnaise, follow your decision with a small stack of fried eggplant on the sandwichâ€™s bottom, followed by another of sliced mozzarella and another of roast beef, then top the whole with the cherry peppers. The eggplant protects the bottom of the sandwich from the moisture of the cheese, while the top absorbs the acidity and fire of the peppers. Fold the mass together, and youâ€™ve got the best sandwich there is. For today, at least. Recipe: The Best   Sandwich"
20876,Gunfire and Panicked Calls on Police Log of Orlando Shooting - The New York Times,Richard PÃ©rez-PeÃ±a and Frances Robles,"It took just 16 minutes. Emergency calls from inside the Pulse nightclub poured into the Orlando police in the early morning of June 12 from panicked and wounded revelers reporting the bloody scene as it played out. Dispatchers noted that they, too, could hear gunshots in the background, according to a police log that was among hundreds of pages of documents about the massacre released by the city on Tuesday. The incident log gives a staccato narration, based on entries made in real time and   down to the minute and the second  â€”   the most detailed account yet of what happened after Omar Mateen, 29, armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, walked into a bustling club with a mostly gay and Latino clientele and opened fire. It shows the confusion as police officials tried to figure out what was happening, the horror of some victims reporting on their own gunshot wounds, and the abject fear of dozens of people trapped in pockets throughout the club, whispering into their phones, pleading for rescue, and hoping that the gunman would not come for them next. Other documents released on Tuesday raised questions about whether one of Pulseâ€™s exits might have been blocked. At the end of a   standoff, for which some have criticized the policeâ€™s delayed response, 49 people had been killed and 53 wounded. But nearly all the slaughter took place in just those first 16 minutes. The first report of shots fired came just before 2:03 a. m. and that awful message was repeated no fewer than 30 times, as caller after caller described the massacre, sometimes in English, sometimes in Spanish, and sometimes just by picking up the horror in the background on their cellphones. Often, the entries say simply, â€œStill shooting,â€ or that people could be heard screaming. At one point, a dispatcher noted having â€œopen line hearing   gunshots. â€ The gunfire paused for 30 seconds or so, until at 2:08 a. m. the first police officers on the scene attempted to enter the building and engaged in a shootout with Mr. Mateen, who then retreated to a bathroom where people were hiding. Just before 2:19 a. m. about the time the cityâ€™s SWAT team was called out, the shooting stopped as suddenly as it had begun, and the killer hunkered down for almost three hours with his hostages. But while the barrage was still underway, evidence of the grim toll began rolling in, noted by dispatchers in entries sprinkled with abbreviations like â€œcâ€ for caller and â€œcadvâ€ for â€œcaller advises. â€ â€œMultiple down. â€ â€œSomeone is screaming Im shot. â€ â€œMy caller is no longer responding, just an open line with moaning. â€ â€œC is shot in the stomach. â€ â€œC is shot in the leg and knee. â€ â€œCadv his friend (redacted) has been shot in the chest. â€ â€œCadv sister has been shot twice. â€ â€œCadv vic is losing a lot of blood. â€ â€œCadv vic is no longer responding to him. â€ Hours after the shooting, the cityâ€™s fire marshal, Tammy Hughes, sent a text message to the fire chief, Roderick Williams, saying that a code enforcement official â€œshowed me a picture where the club owner had blocked the exit with a coke machine. â€ Fire Department officials said Tuesday that the photo was taken on the day of the shooting, but that no exits had been blocked. A lawyer for the club, Gus R. Benitez, also insisted that all public exits had been clear. Ms. Hughes and Mr. Williams also traded emails on the day of the shooting about a May 27 inspection showing that â€œan exit was blocked. â€ But on Tuesday, officials refuted information contained in city records and said that there had been no blocked exit doors and that the only infractions were minor, nothing more serious than a nonworking light bulb in an exit sign. Ms. Hughes wrote on June 12 that the Fire Department had planned another inspection to make sure the problem was corrected, but it had not yet taken place at the time of the shooting. During the nightclub siege, officers went into Pulse several times to bring out stranded survivors, while callers reported that they were still hiding or trapped in various bathrooms, an attic, an office, a dressing room. The incident log shows that they called repeatedly to report casualties and gunfire, warn that their phone batteries were dying, and express their dread at sounds indicating that the gunman may have been approaching. Some even called from the bathroom where the gunman was holed up to tell police what he had said and what he looked like. â€œSubj in restroom whispering please help,â€ a dispatcher wrote. A few times, callers went silent or their calls went dead, leaving dispatchers no way of knowing if they were still alive. At 2:35 a. m. Mr. Mateen called 911 himself to claim responsibility for the attack, and declared allegiance to the Islamic State, the F. B. I. has said. The incident logs show the police trying to pin down the number and location of people still trapped inside Pulse, figure out which bathroom the gunman was in, and determine how serious a threat they were facing. Near the beginning, a caller reported (correctly) that the gunman had an assault rifle, while another reported (incorrectly) that there might be multiple shooters. At 2:51 a. m. when Mr. Mateen was on the phone with a police negotiator, the F. B. I. has said, word came that took the potential danger to another level: â€œShooter saying poss explosives in the parking lot,â€ and a few minutes later in the same call, â€œSubj is saying that he is a terrorist and has several bombs strapped to him in the downstairs female restroom. â€ In addition to the gunmanâ€™s own statements, several entries show the people trapped inside confirming that he appeared to have bombs, which turned out to be untrue. At 4:21 a. m. the police rescued the people in a dressing room by pulling an   unit out of an exterior wall, and some of those people warned that the gunman planned to strap explosive vests to four hostages. It was that information, officials said, that had persuaded them to make the final assault on the club, using explosives and an armored vehicle to punch through a wall. â€œSWAT breached,â€ the log says at 5:02 a. m. At 5:15, as the officers traded gunfire with Mr. Mateen, it notes, â€œShots fired north bathroom,â€ and less than a minute later, â€œSubj down. â€ An entry just before 5:18 a. m. using a police term for armed, states, â€œBad guy down strapped. â€"
20877,Grandiose Ideas for Donald Trump Inaugural Give Way to Traditional - The New York Times,Maggie Haberman and Nicholas Fandos,"  Donald J. Trump kicked around ideas for his inauguration in his office at Trump Tower on Tuesday with two of his oldest friends, Mark Burnett and Thomas Barrack Jr. The ideas spilled out from Mr. Burnett, a   showman best known for producing â€œThe Apprenticeâ€: a parade up Fifth Avenue, a helicopter ride to Washington from New York that could hold the attention of millions of people expected to watch from around the world. Mr. Trump recalled the conversation Wednesday morning to an audience of donors, lobbyists and supporters at Cipriani 42nd Street during a   to help support his transition operation. The details offered a brief glimmer of a sprawling inauguration, full of the kind of showmanship for which Mr. Trump is famous, that could shake up what has become a relatively predictable affair for recent presidents. According to some of the people overseeing the events surrounding Mr. Trumpâ€™s   as the 45th president, they also bore little resemblance to reality. In fact, they said, Mr. Trumpâ€™s celebration would be a relatively subdued affair  â€”   marked by Mr. Trumpâ€™s own touches, to be sure, but in the mold of past affairs. â€œItâ€™s going the opposite way,â€ Mr. Barrack, the private equity investor who is leading the presidential inaugural committee, said in an interview. â€œThe   wants this to be simple. He wants this to be about the people. â€ â€œItâ€™s not about putting on the most expensive talent and spending that kind of money to ingratiate himself,â€ Mr. Barrack added. In many ways, the discussion between the three men in Mr. Trumpâ€™s office tower encapsulates the dueling impulses of the   a man who enjoys being at the center of attention, but who is also aware that he was elected on a strong populist message of â€œdraining the swampâ€ of Washington cronyism and extravagance. In reality, Mr. Trumpâ€™s festivities are constrained by security concerns surrounding the modern presidency, making some gaudier displays impossible and other   ones unrealistic. Each event under consideration must be vetted by the overlapping agencies responsible for securing the transfer of power, including the Secret Service, responsible for a presidentâ€™s security, and the National Park Service, which controls the Mall in Washington. â€œYou have five gigantic security groups that dictate what can and canâ€™t be done,â€ Mr. Barrack said. For example, Mr. Barrack said that hopes to open the White House to visitors, as Andrew Jackson did during his 1829 â€œPeopleâ€™s Inaugurationâ€ (and as other presidents did afterward) had simply proven unrealistic. â€œUnfortunately, security concerns are different than they were in 1829,â€ he said. Despite the modest nature of the events under consideration, Mr. Barrack said Mr. Burnett was actively involved in producing the inauguration week festivities. He will have a large team to work with, as the committeeâ€™s staff in Washington is expected to swell to more than 300 people by Inauguration Day. â€œMark is a genius, and the   loves him,â€ Mr. Barrack said. Referring to the Tuesday meeting, he said, â€œThis was about throwing stuff out if you are thinking in the frame of mind of what a global audience would see. â€ A schedule of inaugural festivities is expected to be completed by Monday. But after the committee rolled out a series of donor packages last week aimed at enticing wealthy contributors and corporations to open their checkbooks, a rough outline of the week has begun to emerge. It will include an opening â€œvictory receptionâ€ for donors, as well as a series of more personal events with the incoming first family, Vice   Mike Pence and members of Mr. Trumpâ€™s cabinet. Donors will be invited to candlelight dinners on the eve of the inauguration, and some will be able to attend one of two official balls planned for inauguration night. Whatever Mr. Trump and the committee ultimately decide, there likely will be plenty of resources at their disposal. Mr. Trumpâ€™s   team has already secured roughly $50 million in pledged donations since it began soliciting money in earnest last week, according to two people involved in the effort. The early success puts Mr. Trump in line to easily surpass President Obamaâ€™s 2009 inauguration, when his finance team raised a record $53 million to pay for the festivities. He should also easily meet or surpass the $65 million to $75 million   goal set by the committee. The event at Cipriani on Wednesday was a   affair, featuring some donors who had vehemently rejected Mr. Trumpâ€™s candidacy, such as the hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, according to an attendee. Those raising money to support the inauguration said they have seen a similar pattern, securing early pledges from prominent Republican donors who did not support Mr. Trump during the campaign. Corporations, they said, have also been forthcoming. Yet, if Mr. Trump is looking forward to his presidency, he has not yet left the past behind, as was clear Wednesday morning. Another person at the   said Mr. Trump delivered a kind of   recollection of winning the primaries and his grim odds for the White House. Mr. Trump said that heading into Election Day, he and his wife, Melania, had planned a vacation in the expectation that they would be seeing an early night. He recalled Mr. Obama telling him privately that the presidentâ€™s advisers had told him on election night, as the numbers looked grim, that North Carolina would be a firewall for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. The attendance at the   spoke to Mr. Trumpâ€™s change of fortune since becoming  . There were at least 850 people in the restaurant. Mr. Trump singled out those in attendance who had been part of the â€œNever Trumpâ€ movement, drawing a large laugh."
20878,Murder Inc. in the White House; Obamaâ€™s Drones for Breakfast Club,Thomas C. Mountain,"Murder Inc. in the White House; Obamaâ€™s Drones for Breakfast Club By Thomas C. Mountain   Thomas C. Mountain 
Elections come and go but when â€œThe Don,â€ Barack Obama, meets with his inner circle of Capos every Tuesday morning its breakfast with drones as in the Murder Incorporated assassination program. 
Think about it, every Tuesday morning in the White House this breakfast club decides who they are going to blow to smithereens that week, with fresh fruit and cappuccinos all around. 
Does Obama lie in bed on Monday nights deciding who to have assasinated the next day? You think I am joking? I went to the same school as Barack Obama, I know it torments the brother to blow away all those women and children at those village weddings but someone has to protect Pax Americana . . . right? 
Hear it straight from the mouth of Barack in 2012. â€œTurns out Iâ€™m really good at killing people. Didnâ€™t know that was a strong suit of mine.â€ . 
The criminal absurdity of the right to kill at will without consequence when you head the most powerful military on the planet as the commander in chief seems to be completely lost on the American sheeple. 
As a star basketball player in high school Barry Oâ€™Bomber, as he was known, left a life of being the only black kid in an elite school of 3,000 to being amongst black Americans for the first time in his life when he left Hawaii for college on â€œthe continent,â€ as it is known in the islands. 
Obama spent most of his childhood completely isolated from blacks, had reached early adulthood before having any black friends and then made his career out of being black. Could this explain his sociopathic behavior? 
I suspect â€œBarry,â€ as his white grandmother renamed him, must know about Murder Inc., the national crime syndicate headed by Lucky Luciano in the 1930s who met regularly to decide whom to kill. 
Mr. Luciano ended up serving life in a federal prison only to be released to set up the Italian Mafia nationally after WW2 as a part of the CIAâ€™s forerunners plan for murder and mayhem against the Italian Communist Party to prevent them from winning the postwar Italian elections. 
Impunity to kill, it runs in American history and Barack Obama finds himself surprisingly good at it. Breakfast with drones, approving the hit list alongside expressos and bagels, Tuesday morning is still Murder Inc. in the Obama White House.

20880,Former Penn State President Found Guilty in Sandusky Abuse Case - The New York Times,Jess Bidgood and Richard PÃ©rez-PeÃ±a,"Five years after a child sex abuse scandal rocked Penn State, damaging its reputation, exposing a revered coach as a serial predator and sending him to prison, a jury on Friday convicted the former president of the university of child endangerment for failing to stop the abuse. On its second day of deliberations, the jury in Harrisburg, Pa. found Graham B. Spanier guilty of one misdemeanor count, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10, 000 fine. He was also found not guilty of two felony charges, for his handling of allegations against Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant coach. Mr. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 young boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. In 2013, Penn State agreed to pay $59. 7 million to 26 sexual abuse victims in exchange for an end to their claims against the university. The extent and nature of the abuse shocked the State College, Pa. community, upended a university that has long adored its vaunted football program and badly tarnished the reputation of the beloved head coach, Joe Paterno, who was among those suspected of turning a blind eye to his assistantâ€™s conduct. The fallout was swift and   in higher education, sports and even state politics. Mr. Paterno, an icon on campus and the most victorious coach in major college football, was dismissed, and died soon after. Much of his coaching staff was dismissed. The university commissioned an investigative report that harshly criticized Mr. Spanier and other administrators, though he disputed its findings. Mr. Spanier, once a   leader who oversaw a period of expansion, was removed as president, though Penn State confirmed on Friday that he remained a tenured faculty member, on paid leave. Tim Curley, the athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a senior vice president, were forced to leave. When Kathleen G. Kane ran for state attorney general in 2012, one of her main themes was that Gov. Tom Corbett had dragged his feet on the Penn State investigation when he was attorney general, part of a male power structure that she said protected its own. But the cases against Mr. Spanier, Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz, brought after she was elected, sputtered after legal delays, and some of the charges were dropped. Ultimately, the proceedings against the three men outlasted Ms. Kane, who fell from power in her own scandal, convicted of perjury and abuse of her office. Mr. Schultz and Mr. Curley, who pleaded guilty last week to one misdemeanor charge each, testified for the prosecution. The three men had been told of possible sexual assault, but â€œinstead of reporting it to authorities, they consciously turned their backs and the abuse continued,â€ Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvaniaâ€™s attorney general, said after the verdict. â€œThese leaders endangered the welfare of children by both their actions and inactions. There are zero excuses when it comes to failing to report the abuse of children to the appropriate authorities. â€ Sam Silver, Mr. Spanierâ€™s lawyer, said, â€œThere always have been substantial questions in this case that need to be reviewed and resolved by the appellate courts, and we fully intend to pursue an appeal. â€ The scandal was one in a series of recent cases sending a message that campus crimes  â€”   particularly sex crimes  â€”   cannot be kept as quiet, or treated as lightly, as they once were. Administrators have been fired from several colleges and universities that failed to report assaults or treat them seriously, including Kenneth W. Starr, who was removed last year as president of Baylor University. â€œCollege administrators have been put on notice that if you know an employee is sexually assaulting people and you leave them in place, you could be held responsible, including legally responsible,â€ said John D. Foubert, a professor of higher education at Oklahoma State University who has written extensively on campus sexual assault. But the circumstances at Penn State set it far apart from most campus sexual assault cases: It involved the abuse of children, a nationally renowned sports program and the downfall of Mr. Paterno. And the criminal charges that resulted, not just against the attacker but against administrators accused of covering up his crimes, have no parallel in recent memory. The count on which Mr. Spanier was convicted was charged as a felony, but the jury instead chose to convict him of the misdemeanor version of it. The jury acquitted him of another felony count of child endangerment, and a charge of conspiracy, also a felony. â€œIâ€™d be foolish to be disappointed,â€ said Laura Ditka, the deputy attorney general who was the lead prosecutor. Asked if she would seek jail time for Mr. Spanier, who remained free on bail, she said, â€œWe arenâ€™t there yet. â€ Childrenâ€™s advocates called the administratorsâ€™ convictions a victory for accountability. â€œWe can no longer put institutional loyalty above protecting kids,â€ said Cathleen Palm, the founder of the Center for Childrenâ€™s Justice, a nonprofit that pushed for changes to Pennsylvaniaâ€™s child abuse policies in the wake of the scandal. Supporters of Mr. Spanier and Mr. Paterno held up the acquittal on the conspiracy charge as vindication. â€œThe story should be that there was no conspiracy to cover up child abuse at Penn State,â€ said Maribeth Roman Schmidt, the executive director of Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship, an alumni group opposed to the sudden ouster of Mr. Paterno and the administrators. Mr. Spanier has long maintained that he was unaware of the seriousness of the accusations against Mr. Sandusky, who prosecutors said met his victims through his charity work, drawing them in with trips to football games and other gifts. The trial, which began with jury selection on Monday after years of legal delays, offered victims and their families the possibility of new information about what the universityâ€™s   officials knew about Mr. Sandusky. Supporters of Mr. Spanier and the administration hoped it would absolve the university of some wrongdoing. â€œIn the view of the jury, with respect to Spanier, and by their own admission, as to Curley and Schultz, these former leaders fell short,â€ Penn State said in a statement released after the verdict. â€œAnd while we cannot undo the past, we have rededicated ourselves and our university to act always with the highest integrity, in affirming the shared values of our community. â€ Mr. Spanier sued the university, accusing it of violating their separation agreement. The university countersued, seeking to recoup more than $5 million it has paid him. Prosecutors contended that Mr. Spanier, along with Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz, was aware of a 2001 report that Mr. Sandusky had showered with a young boy at the university, but that they failed to tell the authorities, acting instead to keep the matter quiet. That choice, prosecutors said, allowed Mr. Sandusky to keep abusing boys for years. They have often pointed to an email written by Mr. Spanier about the episode, after the decision was made to go to Mr. Sandusky directly and tell him to get counseling, rather than alerting the authorities. â€œThe only downside for us is if the message isnâ€™t â€˜heardâ€™ and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it,â€ Mr. Spanier wrote. That could be assessed later, he wrote. For now, he said, speaking to Mr. Sandusky directly was a â€œhumane and a reasonable way to proceed. â€ Prosecution witnesses included Mike McQueary, a former assistant coach who testified that he had told Mr. Paterno, Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz that he had seen Mr. Sandusky molesting the boy in the shower. A victim of Mr. Sanduskyâ€™s who said he was abused in 2002 also testified at Mr. Spanierâ€™s trial. Mr. Spanierâ€™s lawyers called no witnesses in his defense, but, according to news media reports, told the jury that prosecutors had failed to provide evidence that he knew Mr. Sandusky was accused of sexual abuse. Instead, they said, he made a â€œjudgment callâ€ and took action about what he knew. Mr. Spanierâ€™s lawyers have said that the charges against him were politically motivated and an attempt to distract from state prosecutorsâ€™ failures to stop Mr. Sandusky sooner."
20881,"Youâ€™re Fired! Trump Wins Big, Clinton Is Going To Jail",Starkman,"Via Yournewswire 
Let the swamp draining begin. And when the murky stench begins to clear we all know what we will see â€“ a bloated, slimy creature called Hillary Clinton shivering in the shallows. SPONSORED LINKS 
Removed from the corridors of power, she wonâ€™t be able to say â€œI donâ€™t recallâ€ 357 times to FBI investigators and get away with it. Her people wonâ€™t be able to plead the fifth every time they are asked an incriminating question. Hillary is going down, and a lot of her cronies are going with her. 
The arrogance of the Democratic establishment in thinking the country would endorse these people is staggering. Podesta, essentially a foreign agent for Saudi Arabia â€“ with a brother, Tony, a Spirit Cooker who is actually on Saudi books as an agent. You canâ€™t make this stuff up. 
And donâ€™t forget Huma Abedin, thrown off the the campaign in a disastrous, scandal-riddled final week, exposed as being lax with national security â€“ and having close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Her only experience prior to employment as a Hillary State Dept aide? 10 years working at a radical Islamic journal with links to jihad. The Democrat campaign was a dumpster fire. Burn, baby, burn. 
The Democratic establishment should never have nominated such a liability for president. The people wanted Bernie Sanders. The DNC should have let the primary election play out democratically, as their name suggests they would. But no, they interfered, suppressed the voice of their people, and forced a flawed, roundly disliked and distrusted candidate into the full glare of a brutal election season. 
On election night the Democratic establishment got the pounding they deserve. 
Never let the mainstream mediaâ€™s disgraceful collusion with the Clinton campaign be forgotten. May the ignominy live forever. Funneling questions to Clinton so she could defeat her primary rival in debates, colluding with Clintonâ€™s campaign manager John Podesta â€“ at his house â€“ to â€œframe the messageâ€ and â€œframe the race,â€ lying to the American people about their first amendment rights, attempting to scare the population away from being informed. 
CNN is a PR firm, the propaganda arm of the establishment, not a member of the fourth estate. They have been thoroughly exposed by WikiLeaks in 2016. RIP Clinton News Network. Go to hell. 
Donâ€™t forget about the ongoing FBI investigation into the corrupt Clinton Foundation. When Comey cleared her of wrongdoing this week, he was referring to her email scandal. The less publicized Clinton Foundation investigation is still ongoing. The probe was going to hound her into the White House, but now itâ€™s going to throw her in the jailhouse."
20882,North Korea Threatens â€™Super-Mighty Preemptive Strikeâ€™ to Reduce America to â€™Ashesâ€™,John Hayward,"In the latest installment in North Koreaâ€™s   stream of murderous threats, the official newspaper of the Workersâ€™ Party said a North Korean preemptive strike would annihilate both South Korea and the continental United States. [â€œIn the case of our   preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U. S. imperialistsâ€™ invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U. S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,â€ wrote the Rodong Sinmun newspaper.  Reuters notes that North Korea â€œregularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no   in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. â€ Also, the North Koreans are characteristically incensed by the current round of U. S.  Korean military exercises, an aerial training program called â€œMax Thunder,â€ which is scheduled to run through April 28. North Korea always denounces training exercises involving America, South Korea, and other allies, portraying them as practice sessions for a   invasion and sometimes even as the first stage of an invasion disguised as a training exercise. Pyongyangâ€™s rhetoric might be as barbaric as ever, but its actions suggest pressure from the U. S. and China has forced the Kim regime to back away from further provocations, at least temporarily. The analysts who were concerned about an imminent nuclear test at the   test site, timed to coincide with last weekendâ€™s North Korean state holiday celebrations, now report satellite imagery that shows several volleyball games being played at the site. Three volleyball courts are up and running, with a fourth apparently under construction. The analysts at watchdog group 38 North note that the volleyball games could be a deception, and the site remains capable of conducting a nuclear test at any time. U. S. intelligence agencies are working to establish just how serious China is about the North Korean crisis. A U. S. defense official told CNN that China put its cruise   bombers on â€œhigh alertâ€ on Wednesday and appears to be conducting intense maintenance on a large number of military aircraft. CNNâ€™s source believed China is making an effort to â€œreduce the time to react to a North Korea contingency. â€ Russia has also moved troops and military equipment to the North Korean border, possibly to prepare for a wave of refugees after military hostilities or the collapse of the Kim regime."

20884,Will Trump Dump The Wahabbi Autocrats? | New Eastern Outlook,Author,"Country: Saudi Arabia US leaders almost always justify their foreign policy with words about â€œdemocracyâ€ and â€œhuman rights.â€ Especially when talking about the Middle East, the insincerity of such words are blatantly obvious. While US leaders criticize Iran and Syria for alleged human rights violations, the entire world can see that the US allies in the region are serial human rights violators. Israel has been widely condemned for its treatment of Palestinians. Saudi Arabia is a country where even the basic notion of human rights does not exist. The Kingdom is an absolute monarchy where people can still be executed by beheading or crucifixion in the 21st century. Crimes punishable by death under the Saudi regime include â€œsorceryâ€ and â€œinsulting the King.â€ Under Saudi law, the people are not citizens with rights, but rather â€œsubjectsâ€ who are essentially the Kingâ€™s property. Qatar is yet another repressive regime. Like Saudi Arabia, it is an absolute monarchy, where a King serves as the unelected autocrat. Bahrain is known not only for its lack of democratic structures, but for its repression of the Shia Muslim majority who frequently take to the streets, demanding their rights. The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, and almost every other US-aligned regime in the Arab world has a primitive political system, centered on an autocratic monarchy. These regimes are known to torture, behead, flog, repress free speech, oppress religious minorities, and do all kinds of things US leaders claim to oppose. This does not prevent the United States from selling weapons to these regimes, or from purchasing their oil. This also does not prevent the USA from establishing military bases on their soil, and otherwise coddling them. In fact, the Financial Times describes how the United Arab Emirates is becoming a beloved â€œtax havenâ€ for the rich and powerful in the western world. While western leaders love to talk about human rights, they have no problem with autocratic emirates handling their money . The Roots of Wahabbi Terrorism More shockingly, the involvement of these regimes in terrorism has not deterred US support. It took 15 years for the classified 28 pages of the 9/11 Commission report to be released. The pages revealed that Saudi government officials had collaborated with the 9/11 hijackers. It furthermore revealed that Saudi Arabia had been uncooperative and offered minimal support to US officials with their investigations during the aftermath of the attacks. The Saudi Royal family owes its reign to the British Empire. During the 1800s the British discovered that the House of Saud were useful allies against the Ottoman Empire, and were more than willing to sell their oil at a reasonable price. The Saudi monarchy professes a particularly conservative brand of Islam known as â€œWahabbism.â€ While not every Wahabbi has been involved in terrorism, Al-Queda, ISIS, Al-Nusra, Osama Bin Laden, Omar Mateen, and nearly every Middle-Eastern or Central-Asian terrorist who has menaced the world in recent years has been an adherent of Wahabbism. Wahabbism is particularly anti-Western and anti-American. Opponents of the Saudi ideology it often call it â€œTakfirism,â€ a term that refers to Wahabbiâ€™s willingness to kill other Muslims with whom they disagree. The relationship between Wahabbi fanatics and Britainâ€™s wealthy has not ended. A recent article in the Financial Times describes how British Houses of Finance now specialize in â€œIslamic Banking.â€ While many Islamic scholars describe the very concept as fraudulent, many financial institutions are accommodating sultans, emirates, and princes who adhere to strict Wahabbi laws. Islam forbids lending money for interest, so many financial institutions have invented loopholes with hidden fees, investment returns, and other mechanisms that can accommodate strict adherents . During the 1980s, the CIA worked with the heir of a wealthy Saudi construction dynasty to build a Wahabbi army. Osama bin Laden was sent to Afghanistan to build an army of â€œMujihadeenâ€ to topple the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party. The USA worked closely with the fanatical Wahabbi terrorists to battle the Marxist government of Afghanistan and their Soviet allies. Currently, the United States works with Saudi Arabia to fund a Wahabbi insurgency against the secular Syrian Arab Republic. ISIS and Al-Nusra are known to be terrorists inspired by the Saudi ideology. The Saudis have been caught directly helping them out. Among the US backed â€œmoderate rebels,â€ many Wahabbis can also be found. Most of the various US-aligned autocracies in the Middle East can be linked to Wahabbi forces in Syria. Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and other regimes have made the goal of â€œregime changeâ€ in Syria a priority, and many ISIS fighters have emerged from their respective populations. Is The Tide Turning? While the past three presidencies of Bush, Obama, and Clinton have involved massive coddling of the Saudi regime, Donald Trump often spoke against Saudi Arabia during his Presidential campaign. Furthermore, in a recent move, the US Congress dramatically overrode Barack Obamaâ€™s veto, and passed the controversial JASTA bill, allowing victims of terrorism to sue the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in US courts. While Trump often appealed to ignorant and Islamophobic sentiments among Americans, he also appealed to an isolationist desire to stop meddling around the world. Trump made fighting ISIS, the Wahabbi extremist group unleashed amid US-Saudi regime change efforts, a key plank of his campaign. Will Trump live up to his words? Will the USA end its alliance with Pro-Wahabbi autocratic regimes that are linked to terrorism? Though Trump spoke against the Saudis and talked of fighting ISIS, his campaign included reckless denunciations of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Trumpâ€™s speeches often seemed to lump Iran in with ISIS, ignoring the fact that Iranian Revolutionary Guards are on the battlefield each and every day, risking their lives to defeat ISIS. Iran is greatly threatened by ISIS terrorism. ISIS and most Wahabbis consider the Islamic Republic of Iran to be led by â€œShia Apostates.â€ ISIS and other anti-government forces in Syria have recruited fighters from around the world on the basis of toppling Syrian President Bashar Assad because of his Alawi faith, which Wahabbis consider to be a variation of Shia apostasy. 
Contradictory Middle East Positions For too long, the USA has been targeting secular, nationalist governments like the Baathist regimes of Iraq and Syria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or Gaddafiâ€™s Libya. In doing so they have been passively helping and strengthening the bloodthirsty Wahabbi fanatics who these regimes have held back, and whose ideological foundation is promoted by Saudi Arabia. If Trump is serious about stopping ISIS and the surrounding wave of Wahabbi terrorism, he will immediately end the US financial and military relationship with the Saudi regime, as well as the nearby, pro-Wahabbi autocracies. Furthermore, Trump will need to end his irresponsible demonization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and join with the Iranians, the Russians, the Syrian government, and China in the fight against ISIS terrorism. If Trump were to do this, it would be one of the most dramatic shifts ever seen in US foreign policy. During his campaign, Trump has taken two somewhat contradictory positions in relation to the Middle East. While he has denounced Saudi Arabia and talked about how US â€œregime changeâ€ policies have strengthened terrorism, he has also repeated the anti-Iranian talking points of Netanyahu, and spoken with great admiration for Israel. Israel has been the greatest direct beneficiary of the US policy in the Middle East. Each regime the US has targeted in the regionâ€“Syria, Iraq, and Iranâ€“have been outspoken opponents of Israel who directly support Palestinian resistance. Meanwhile, the Wahabbi-linked autocrats denounce Israel in words, but do very little to threaten its existence or strength. Israelâ€™s primary enemies, Iran and Syria, are also the primary target of the Wahabbi fanatics and the Saudi monarchy. Israeli and Saudi Arabia may denounce each other, but their foreign policies both center on hostility to what the Saudis call â€œthe Shia crescent.â€ Regarding the Middle East, the new President will be forced to decide whether he seeks to continue aligning US and Israel foreign policies, and targeting Iran and Syria, or whether he wants to end Wahabbi terrorism, and stop cooperating with the regimes actively linked to it. Trump is often perceived as quite unpredictable. Whichever choice he makes, it is likely to surprise many people. Caleb Maupin is a political analyst and activist based in New York. He studied political science at Baldwin-Wallace College and was inspired and involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement, especially for the online magazine â€œNew Eastern Outlookâ€ .

20885,The Source of our Rage: The Ruling Elite Is Protected from the Consequences of its Dominance,Gillian,"Leave a reply Please read my election note at the end of the essay â€“ C H Smith Charles Hugh Smith â€“ There are many sources of rage: injustice, the destruction of truth, powerlessness. But if we had to identify the one key source of non-elite rage that cuts across all age, ethnicity, gender and regional boundaries, it is this: The Ruling Elite is protected from the destructive consequences of its predatory dominance. We see this reality across the entire political, social and economic landscape. If I had to pick one chart that illustrates the widening divide between the Ruling Elite and the non-elites, it is this chart of wages as a share of the nationâ€™s output (GDP): 46 years of relentless decline, interrupted by gushing fountains of credit and asset bubbles that enriched the few while leaving the economic landscape of the many in ruins. The Ruling Elite once had an obligation to uphold the social contract as a responsibility that came with their vast privilege, power and wealth (i.e. noblesse oblige). Americaâ€™s Ruling Elite has transmogrified into an incestuous self-serving few unapologetically plundering the many. In their hubris-soaked arrogance, their right to rule is unquestioningly based on their moral and intellectual superiority to â€œthe little peopleâ€ they loot with abandon. Rather than feel a responsibility to the nation, Americaâ€™s Elite views the status quo as a free pass to self-aggrandizement. Much has changed in America in the past 46 years. Not only have wages and salaries declined as a share of â€œeconomic growth,â€ but the wealth that has been generated has flowed to the top of the wealth/power pyramid (see chart below). Social mobility has also declined drastically: Restoring Americaâ€™s Economic Mobility , as has trust in government and key institutions. As Frank Buckley, the author of The Way Back: Restoring the Promise of America observed: â€œIn a corrupt country, trust is a rare commodity. Thatâ€™s America today. Only 19 percent of Americans say they trust the government most of the time, down from 73 percent in 1958 according to the Pew Research Center.â€ The top .01% has seen its share of the household wealth triple from 7% to 22% in the past four decades, while the share of the nationâ€™s wealth owned by the bottom 90% has plummeted from 36% to 23%. Distribution of wealth in the US since 1917 (image) As I described in Americaâ€™s Ruling Elite Has Failed and Deserves to Be Fired and Now That the Presidential-Election Side Show Is Finally Endingâ€¦. , the economy is rapidly undergoing structural changes that tend to reward the top 5% class of technocrats and managers and the top .1% with millions in mobile capital, while leaving the bottom 95% in the dust. The ever-widening wage gap (image) Rather than address this rising inequality directly and honestly, the Ruling Elite has parroted propaganda and policies that protect their gains while obfuscating the reality that most American households have been losing ground for decades, a decline that has been masked by replacing real income with rising debt. The ceaseless parroting of the Ruling Elite and the Mainstream Media that prosperity has been rising for everyone is nothing less than the destruction of truth. This propaganda has one purpose: to mask the inequality and injustice built into the American status quo. The rapid concentration of wealth has also concentrated political power in the hands of a few who seamlessly combine public and private modes of power. This wealth and power protects the Ruling Elite from the perverse consequences of their dominance. Their precious offspring rarely serve at the point of the American militaryâ€™s spear, they never lose their jobs or income when corporations shift production (and R&D, etc.) overseas, and they are never replaced with illegal immigrants paid under the table. Rather, the Ruling Elite is pleased to pay immigrants a pittance to care for their children, clean their luxe homes, walk their dogs, etc. This is why weâ€™re enraged: we bear the consequences of the Ruling Eliteâ€™s dominance. The system is rigged to benefit the few, who use their wealth and power to protect themselves from the destructive consequences of their self-serving dominance. This rage is as yet inchoate, sensed but not yet understood as the inevitable result of a broken system and a predatory Elite that exploits the system to maximize their private gain by any means available. Election Note : As I write this Tuesday evening, it appears Donald Trump may win the presidency. For those who cannot understand how anyone could possibly vote for Trump, please read the above essay again and ponder what people were voting against by voting for Trump. They may well have been voting against the corrupt, self-serving status quo rather than voting for the individual Donald Trump. There are very few opportunities for powerless non-elites to register their disapproval of the nationâ€™s Ruling Elite and the corrupt status quo. Voting for an outsider in a national election is one such rare opportunity. As I noted in October, The Ruling Elite Has Lost the Consent of the Governed (October 20, 2016). If you still donâ€™t understand how Trump could win, please read the above essay as many times as is necessary for you to get it: the status quo of corrupt self-serving insiders generates injustice and inequality as its only possible output.

20886,Even Penguins Have Children Who Wonâ€™t Leave the Nest - The New York Times,Nicholas Bakalar,"GalÃ¡pagos penguin chicks have it good. Even when they are old enough to hunt on their own, they beg their parents for food  â€”   and the parents give in. Recently researchers in the GalÃ¡pagos watched as fully fledged birds squeaked and pleaded until their parents turned to them and regurgitated a meal into their mouths. One big young bird, recorded on video, was fed, then followed his parent squeaking for more until the besieged adult escaped by diving into the water. The study is online in The Wilson Journal of Ornithology. In the GalÃ¡pagos, food supplies vary. When times are good and there is plenty of food, one way of assuring the survival of the species is for parents to help their adult children with some extra nourishment. GalÃ¡pagos penguins forage just offshore, close to their nests, and return to the nest site after the young fledge, so parents and fledglings are likely to encounter one another frequently. Only one other of the 18 species of penguins is known to do this: the Gentoo penguins. These birds, which inhabit Antarctica and nearby islands, feed their young after they have fledged for about 12 days, probably to give them time to learn how to hunt for themselves. The GalÃ¡pagos penguins, the only penguins that live north of the Equator, are endangered, with fewer than 2, 000 left in the world. They are not always so  . â€œWhen conditions are good, they can raise two chicks in a season and continue to feed them,â€ said Dee Boersma, a professor of biology at the University of Washington and the lead author of the study. â€œWhen thereâ€™s little food around,â€ Professor Boersma continued, â€œthey save themselves, forgetting about both eggs and chicks. â€"
20887,A New York Holiday Tradition to Count On? Big Crowds - The New York Times,Winnie Hu,"Bruna Gomes has made the holiday rounds in New York City. The glittering windows at Macyâ€™s. The Radio City Rockettes   with Santa. The pilgrimage to the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. Her new tradition? Staying home. â€œI promised myself Iâ€™d never go back because itâ€™s so crowded,â€ Ms. Gomes, 22, said. It is supposed to be a festive time of year. But tell that to all the New Yorkers confronted by the crush of humanity at many of their cherished holiday destinations. Moms strategize about the best times to visit department store Santas with the precision of a military campaign. At Macyâ€™s Santaland, desperate dads have tried to bribe the elves to skip past the long lines. The throngs of ice skaters and shoppers descending on Bryant Parkâ€™s Winter Village have taken up all the seats, choked walkways and brought foot traffic to a shuffle. The famed window displays along Fifth Avenue get so many admirers that just catching a glimpse can be hard, let alone taking a family photo. When Ms. Gomes broke her promise and recently took a friend to see the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, she found herself stranded in the middle of an intersection on Fifth Avenue. â€œI got stuck there,â€ she said. â€œI was literally standing in the crowd. â€™â€™ As if New York City did not already have plenty of people, the holidays draw more each year as surely as children make wish lists and doormen count on tips. From Thanksgiving to New Yearâ€™s, the city attracts five million visitors  â€”   seemingly undeterred by security concerns  â€”   who provide a   boon to businesses and the cityâ€™s bottom line but who also overrun subways, streets and attractions. The annual â€œChristmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettesâ€ plays to an audience of more than a million, or roughly the population of San Jose, Calif. each season. Every day, about 800, 000 people pass through Rockefeller Center, where the outsize tree draws crowds to match. Macyâ€™s Christmas windows attract, on average, 8, 000 to 10, 000 people an hour, up from 5, 000 to 7, 000 a few years ago, according to the store. Upstairs, on the eighth floor,   inch through a maze of Christmas trees, stuffed reindeer and caroling snowmen in a painted   village. For those who know to make reservations ahead of time, there is an express   similar to the   used at Disneyâ€™s theme parks, guarded by   elves who have been offered a $20 or $50 bill by   line skippers. The   are not just piling into Manhattan. At the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, an annual holiday train show with model rail cars whirring past miniature replicas of city landmarks  â€”   new this year, the Queensboro Bridge and the Coney Island Cyclone and Wonder Wheel  â€”   brought out a record 266, 000 visitors last year, up from 165, 000 in 2010. Of course, what would New York City be without crowds? Want peace and quiet? Try the North Pole. Gregory Holmes, 32, who was visiting last week from Nashville, said he did not come to New York for serenity. â€œI love big crowds of people enjoying themselves thatâ€™s what New York is about, the hustle and bustle,â€ said Mr. Holmes, who was power shopping  â€”   spending more than $1, 500 on clothes and shoes at stores including Macyâ€™s, HM and Uniqlo  â€”   in between taking in the sights. â€œMore money is coming out of my pocket in the past three days than in the past two months. â€ But even New Yorkers used to crowds are finding more visitors under foot and in the way. Kimberly Charles, a stylist from Brooklyn, says the window displays are so beautiful that she wants to stop and look. Yet, whenever she takes five steps toward them, she finds everyone else has the same idea. In recent years, she has mostly stayed away from the windows, though she cannot completely avoid the      who block the sidewalks. â€œItâ€™s not road rage, itâ€™s foot rage,â€ she said. â€œYouâ€™re just trying to get around everybody and keep going. â€ Near the Holland Tunnel the other evening, Ms. Charles stopped short for another reason. Oshun Brown, 20, an    was turning pirouettes on Varick Street, handing out free candy canes, and posing with   pedestrians for â€œelfies. â€ Ms. Charles walked past him and then turned around to get a candy cane. The holiday congestion had inspired a local group, Hudson Square Connection, which runs a business improvement district in the neighborhood, to start a new tradition: dispatching eight prancing and caroling elves along with traffic managers to keep the peace at heavily congested intersections. â€œThereâ€™s only so much you can do about congestion, so we thought, â€˜Letâ€™s make it fun,â€™â€ said Ellen Baer, the president of the Hudson Square Connection. Some holiday destinations have taken steps to reduce lines. At Bryant Parkâ€™s Winter Village, nestled among Midtown Manhattan skyscrapers, the free ice rink drew 247, 989 skaters last winter, more than double the number from a decade earlier. Hundreds used to wait two or three hours in lines that wrapped around the park. This year, the park streamlined the   process and introduced a   system that sends skaters text messages when it is their turn. The New York Botanical Garden accommodated the growing numbers at its train show by increasing the exhibit space by half, to 12, 800 square feet, last year. It has also added more   night hours where alcohol is served, with 11 â€œbar car nightsâ€ this year, up from three in 2011. And it has timed tickets so visitors do not have to wait in line. â€œEvery year, itâ€™s more popular,â€ said Henry Cabrera, the botanical gardenâ€™s associate vice president for visitor experience. â€œItâ€™s a great problem to have. Probably in five years weâ€™ll be thinking of what to do next. â€ Along Fifth Avenue, the holiday sightseers have been joined this year by political aficionados and gawkers hoping for a glimpse of   Donald J. Trump, who lives and works at Trump Tower. Lloyd Kemp, 59, a Brooklyn resident who collects donations for the homeless, said he usually sets up outside Bergdorf Goodman, a block from Trump Tower, but was asked to move by the police as part of tighter security. So there was Mr. Kemp on the sidewalk in front of Saks Fifth Avenue, tucked in between the   windows and the metal barricades lining the street. One tourist after another stopped to ask him directions. The nearest subway? A good restaurant? He answered cheerfully in a booming voice. One woman, leaning back to take a photograph, tripped and fell against a barricade. He caught her arm. Another asked who had the best windows this year. Mr. Kempâ€™s money was on Saks, his new home. â€œThis is more crowded than Trump Tower,â€ he said. â€œAnd this is more pleasant because people come here to uplift their spirits. â€ As Christmas approaches, some of the biggest crowds can be found outside Macyâ€™s Herald Square. It can be chaos, said Crosby Reynolds, 27, a street cleaner. People are crammed together. Some are yelling at others to get out of the way. They step on the litter he is trying to pick up. â€œI kind of wait until it loosens up a little and then I sneak in,â€ he said. Mr. Reynolds has yet to bring his    son to see the Macyâ€™s windows. â€œItâ€™s too much,â€ he said. â€œI see enough when Iâ€™m here. â€"
20888,Runway vs. Red Carpet - The New York Times,Vanessa Friedman,"MILAN  â€”   Didnâ€™t Isabelle Huppert look great? And Viola Davis? What about that peachy color on Nicole Kidman? Such were the whispers going around at the Giorgio Armani show on Monday, the morning after the night before  â€”   which is to say, in the bleachers of the Armani Theater just a few hours after Mr. Armani had dressed those   nominees for what is arguably the biggest fashion show of them all, the Academy Awards. Perhaps acknowledging that itâ€™s almost impossible for the runway to compete with the red carpet these days  â€”   no one, after all, understands the power of Hollywood, and how it can be harnessed for fashion, better than Mr. Armani  â€”   the designer kept the gowns in Milan to a minimum (one final showstopper in a rainbow of swirling crystals, a black velvet column twinkling stars) and instead concentrated on a multiplicity of fluid trousers and natty jackets in jewel tones and tactile fabrications. Plus a somewhat   new idea: skinny pants with an insert of pleated silk chiffon attached in the front or back in a contrasting color to create a  . A skant? A pirt? It was one way to startle people away from the   slide shows on their cellphones and into attention. In one of the more unfortunate coincidences of timing, the Milan womenâ€™s wear season draws to a close in the long shadow of the Oscars. It tends to make for a pretty anticlimactic ending. Everyone is focused on the clothes over there, when they are supposed to be focused over here. Whatâ€™s a designer to do? Take a cue from the movies, apparently. Arthur Arbesser, for one, part of the fresh crop of names in the city, started with Wim Wendersâ€™s 1987 film â€œWings of Desire,â€ set in the Berlin circus scene, and then embraced  â€”   well, not gold, but bronze, in the form of gleaming vinyl, as well as a kaleidoscopic   mix in knits and cotton shirting, vinyl and latex. The multiple stripes and squares tumbled together in a not entirely successful mix of clownish proportions. Stella Jean, meanwhile, another   also went Eastern bloc, though even more literally, upping the narrative by weaving a tale of the Cold War and Siberia (and Syria, too) full of military memorabilia and folkloric fantasy. Think   with velvet epaulets, gold fringe and rows of decorative medals paired with skirts depicting village scenes in winter, babushka headgear and leopard print,   patchworks of silk and brocade. Less dramatic, however, was Salvatore Ferragamo, where Fulvio Rigoni, making his official debut as design director for womenâ€™s wear, beat a strategic retreat toward the long, lean and mostly neutral. Dresses were sleeveless and patched together from abstracted animal prints, sometimes with a trompe lâ€™oeil cape of a sweater hanging off the back, as if the model had just shrugged out of her cardigan outerwear came complete with curving double portrait collars (including on a long sleeveless puffer coat, one of the weirder ideas) and trousers were   . Paired with Paul Andrewâ€™s towering   stacked heels on   bootees, the collection looked like the beginning of an idea that had not yet burst into bloom. For posies, as well as leopard print, ruched sheaths, velvet trouser suits, robot appliquÃ©s,   chubbies (donâ€™t be a cuddly puma, wear one instead!) elaborately embroidered denim,       prints, puppy prints, tuxes of all types, corsetry, and a gold Lurex crocheted minidress with hearts all over, there was Dolce  Gabbana. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana had what seemed like an   of their own, but instead of golden statuettes, there were golden tiaras. On almost everyone. I know this, not because I was at the show (The New York Times, as we have pointed out before, is not invited to attend the collection, for reasons rooted in history that began long before I arrived at the newspaper) but because it became a social media sensation thanks to the digital reach of the millennials, children of and influencers who walked in the show (alongside a few models and many very good customers)  â€”   a combined total of approximately 65 million followers on Instagram, according to the website fashionunfiltered. com. As a result, I could watch it. So I did! Given the emphasis the brand has placed on its relationship with the digital generation over the last year or so, it seemed the appropriate thing to do. The livestream (and related coverage) wasnâ€™t quite as long as a feature, but almost. Seemingly pitched as a celebration of family  â€”   the family the brand has made, and literal family, as relatives of all generations walked  â€”   it came complete with   celebrity front row (see: Rene Russo, Christie Brinkley, Jamie Foxx, Pamela Anderson) attracted by the fact their children were strutting in the show. Between that and the frenzy generated by a   from the teen idol Austin Mahone (10 million Instagram followers) no one seemed to pay much attention to the clothes. Though that could also be because  â€”   save, perhaps, for the Justin Bieber    â€”   they looked like they had come straight from the Dolce archive of greatest hits. Thereâ€™s something for everyone inside. But then, the collection was almost beside the point. Which could be summed up fairly simply: If you canâ€™t beat â€™em, and donâ€™t want to join â€™em, go viral on â€™em. Now to Paris."

20891,Wife of Orlando Gunman Is Charged Under Antiterrorism Laws - The New York Times,"Erin Marie Daly, Richard PÃ©rez-PeÃ±a and Adam Goldman","OAKLAND, Calif.  â€”   She fired none of the shots, she was nowhere near the bloody scene, and none of the evidence made public so far hints that she shared her husbandâ€™s violent jihadist ideology. Yet Noor Zahi Salman, the widow of the gunman who massacred revelers at an Orlando nightclub, stood before a federal judge on Tuesday as the only person charged in the attack. In the early hours of June 12, Ms. Salmanâ€™s husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub, and wounded 53 others in one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil. Before being fatally shot by the police, Mr. Mateen, a    security guard, declared his allegiance to the Islamic State. Though suspicion and scrutiny naturally fall on people close to someone who commits terrorism or mass murder, it is rare for a wife or a girlfriend to end up facing charges. But in a brief hearing in federal court in Oakland, a federal prosecutor, Roger Handberg, explained why the authorities considered Ms. Salman an exception. â€œShe knew he was going to conduct the attack,â€ Mr. Handberg said. An indictment unsealed on Tuesday accused Ms. Salman, 30, of â€œaiding and abetting the attempted provision and provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization,â€ a charge that can carry a sentence of life in prison. She was also charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly misleading police officers and federal agents, who interviewed her for 12 hours on the day of the shooting. Ms. Salman went with her husband to buy ammunition, drove him to Orlando when he apparently scouted his target, and knew that he watched jihadist propaganda videos. Those could be innocent acts or indications of criminal culpability, depending on her own intent and what she knew of his. Her fate could turn on evidence about her frame of mind, including how much she was controlled by her husband, who she has said abused her. â€œWeâ€™ve seen the government trying to widen the definition of â€˜material support,â€™ and the increased visibility of women being involved in jihadist movementsâ€ makes it easier to imagine charging them with terrorism, said Nimmi Gowrinathan, a visiting professor at the City College of New York who studies women in violent situations around the world. In an interview last fall with The New York Times, her only public statement since the attack, Ms. Salman said she had not known what her husband planned to do, a claim that her uncle, Al Salman, made repeatedly outside the courthouse on Tuesday. Prosecutors, who plan to pursue the case in a federal court in Florida, gave little new information, leaving unclear what evidence they had or why seven months had passed before charges were filed. Ms. Salman, who was arrested on Monday and has a young son fathered by Mr. Mateen, has been living with relatives in Rodeo, Calif. northeast of San Francisco. Visibly shaking in a   and gray jail uniform, Ms. Salman stood in court Tuesday and, in a barely audible voice, told Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu, who had to ask her to speak up, that she understood the charges against her. Only when she was led from the courtroom did she raise her head and let her eyes search the packed gallery. On Wednesday, the judge will consider whether to grant bail. The married couple who fatally shot 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. in 2015 provide the clearest case of a wife as accomplice, but examples remain rare. A study of more than 100 terrorists in Western countries who acted alone or in pairs found that most of them were single.   percent confided in someone about their plans, the authors found, but   research showed that only 4 percent told a spouse, a girlfriend or a boyfriend. The closest parallel to Ms. Salman may be Katherine Russell, the widow of one of the Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and the mother of his child. The bombs detonated at the race in 2013 were made in the home she and her husband shared, and testimony at the trial of the surviving bomber  â€”   Ms. Russellâ€™s    Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  â€”   indicated that her computer had been used for a search on the rewards that come to the widow of a martyr for Islam. Ms. Russell talked to investigators but refused to testify before a grand jury without immunity from prosecution. Federal agents investigating the case were eager to bring charges against her, but prosecutors decided not to. Ms. Salman and Mr. Mateenâ€™s former wife, Sitora Yusufiy, have both said that he beat them severely and tried to control every aspect of their lives. Citing that abuse, a lawyer for Ms. Salman, Linda Moreno, said recently that it was â€œmisguided and wrong to prosecute her. â€ Experts say that domestic violence is a common trait among mass killers and terrorists, and that close relatives are often among their victims. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was also accused of domestic violence by a previous girlfriend. â€œMisogyny and extremism work together very often, so abuse is entrenched in these cases,â€ Dr. Gowrinathan, the City College professor, said. But, she added, sympathy for women as victims of abuse tends to evaporate in terrorism cases. At the time of the Pulse shooting, Ms. Salman was at home in Fort Pierce, Fla. a   drive from Orlando, but the indictment charged that she had been abetting her husbandâ€™s plans since at least late April. Prosecutors say she knowingly misled the F. B. I. agents and Fort Pierce police officers who interviewed her. The indictment also says the government wants her to forfeit more than $30, 000, which may be connected to the jewelry she has said her husband lavished on her in the final days of his life. In interviews last year, friends and acquaintances described Ms. Salman as a relatively naÃ¯ve young woman, a doting mother who could have unwittingly witnessed the buildup to her husbandâ€™s attack. The daughter of Palestinian immigrants, she struggled in high school, they said, but earned an associate degree at a community college before meeting Mr. Mateen, a son of Afghan immigrants, on an Arab dating website. â€œI was unaware of everything,â€ Ms. Salman said in the Times interview last year. â€œI donâ€™t condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people. â€ She said that she had known her husband was viewing jihadist videos, but that she had disapproved and forced him to turn them off so that their son would not see them. She said that the drive to Orlando had seemed innocent, and that the ammunition purchase was unremarkable for a security guard who practiced at a shooting range. The F. B. I. questioned Mr. Mateen after he told   in 2013 that he had ties to terrorist groups like Hezbollah, and again in 2014, when his name came up in another terrorism case. But agents never found evidence that he was plotting an attack. In the Times interview, Ms. Salman said she had thought that if her husband had been a danger, the F. B. I. would have arrested him."
20892,A Sour Surprise for Public Pensions: Two Sets of Books - The New York Times,Mary Williams Walsh,"When one of the tiniest pension funds imaginable  â€”   for Citrus Pest Control District No. 2, serving just six people in California  â€”   decided last year to convert itself to a 401( k) plan, it seemed like a  . After all, the little fund held far more money than it needed, according to its official numbers from Californiaâ€™s renowned public pension system, Calpers. Except it really didnâ€™t. In fact, it was significantly underfunded. Suddenly Calpers began demanding a payment of more than half a million dollars. â€œMy board was somewhat shocked,â€ said Larry Houser, the general manager of the pest control district, whose workers tame the bugs and blights that threaten their corner of California citrus country. It is just a few miles down the road from Joshua Tree National Park. It turns out that Calpers, which managed the little pension plan, keeps two sets of books: the officially stated numbers, and another set that reflects the â€œmarket valueâ€ of the pensions that people have earned. The second number is not publicly disclosed. And it typically paints a much more troubling picture, according to people who follow the money. The crisis at Citrus Pest Control District No. 2 illuminates a profound debate now sweeping the American public pension system. It is pitting specialist against specialist  â€”   this year in the rarefied confines of the American Academy of Actuaries, not far from the White House, the elite professionals who crunch pension numbers for a living came close to blows over this very issue. But more important, it raises serious concerns that governments nationwide do not know the true condition of the pension funds they are responsible for. That exposes millions of people, including retired public workers, local taxpayers and municipal bond buyers  â€”   who are often retirees themselves  â€”   to risks they have no way of knowing about. â€œOne of the first things I think you should do is publish that number for every city,â€ said William F. Sharpe, professor emeritus of finance at Stanford Universityâ€™s Graduate School of Business who won the Nobel in economic science in 1990 for his work on how the markets price financial instruments. He is also a California resident who voluntarily helped his city,     crack the secret pension code  â€”   figuring out the market value of its debt to its retirees in 2011 before Calpers resolved to start divulging the information later that year. â€œWe just about nailed it, which made us feel very good for ourselves  â€”   but very bad for the city,â€ Professor Sharpe said. On a market basis, the city turned out to be $48 million short of what it owed retirees, or four times what the official numbers showed. The two competing ways of valuing a pension fund are often called the actuarial approach (which is geared toward helping employers plan stable annual budgets, as opposed to measuring assets and liabilities) and the market approach, which reflects more   math. The market value of a pension reflects the full cost today of providing a steady, guaranteed income for life  â€”   and itâ€™s large. Alarmingly large, in fact. This is one reason most states and cities donâ€™t let the market numbers see the light of day. But in recent years, even the more modest actuarial numbers have been growing, as populations age and many public workers retire. In California, some struggling local governments now doubt they can really afford their pension plans, and have told Calpers they want out. In response, Calpers has calculated the heretofore unknown market value of their pension promises  â€”   and told them thatâ€™s the price of leaving, payable immediately. Few have that much cash, so itâ€™s welcome to the Hotel California: You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave. Calpers says it must bill departing governments for every penny their pensions could possibly cost because once they cash out, Calpers has no way of going back and getting more money from them if something goes wrong. Calpers keeps that money in a separate â€œtermination pool. â€ Things went differently for Citrus Pest Control District No. 2. It withdrew first, before realizing the shortfall. Then, four months later, it got the unexpected bill from Calpers. â€œI was opening the mail and thinking, â€˜Can this be right?â€™ I thought they put an extra zero on it,â€ said Tim Hoesterey, one of the districtâ€™s two employees. The bill came just as the district was building up a war chest to fight a virulent new citrus blight, a disease that had already devastated groves in Florida. The directors had armed themselves by raising a growersâ€™ tax per acre fivefold. Suddenly, paying Calpers would wipe out the whole citrus blight reserve. Some wondered if they should just declare bankruptcy. â€œThere are people selling their farms, trying to get out of the business, because they canâ€™t make a profit anymore,â€ Mr. Hoesterey said. He called Calpers to see if the district could get a break, an extended due date, or even stay with Calpers after all. Calpers said no. It was a done deal. A Calpers spokeswoman, Amy Morgan, said such questions suggested â€œa misunderstanding of the purpose of Calpers. â€ â€œCalpers does not exist to make money,â€ she said. â€œCalpers exists to fully pay out benefits that are promised to its members. â€ She said the law required Calpers to perform a complete valuation after the termination date had passed, and to recover all the money needed to ensure that the retirees would be paid in full. Today in California, both the market values and the actuarial pension values for many places are available on a website run by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. But for the 49 other states, the market numbers remain unknown. The   numbers are â€œclose to the truth of the liability,â€ Professor Sharpe said. But most elected officials want the smaller numbers, and actuaries provide what their clients want. â€œSomebody just should have stopped this whole charade,â€ he said. For years, people have been trying to do just that. In 2003, the Society of Actuaries, a respected professional body, devoted most of its annual meeting to what was called â€œthe Great Controversyâ€  â€”   the notion that the actuarial standards for pensions were fundamentally flawed, causing systemic underfunding and setting up a   train wreck when baby boomers retired. It drew a    crowd. The problem reaches far beyond pensions, and into the $3. 7 trillion municipal bond market. The reason is that municipal bond ratings take into account the strength (or weakness) of government pension plans. If those numbers have been consistently wrong, as dissidents argued, then actuaries were helping mislead the investors buying municipal bonds. Arguably, the flawed standards worsened the problem with each passing year: Actuarial values determine the annual contributions that states and local governments make to their pension plans, so if the target numbers are too low, the contributions will always be too small. Shortfalls will be compounding, invisibly. Much of the debate surrounded the routine practice of translating future pension payments into todayâ€™s dollars, which is called discounting. The tiny pension plan at Citrus Pest Control District No. 2 shows clearly what the problem is. With everybody either retired, or about to be (Mr. Houser will retire later this year) there is no guesswork in determining everybodyâ€™s pensions. The actuaries at Calpers project each of the future monthly payments due to Mr. Houser and the other five retirees, assuming they will live to age 90. (Mr. Hoesterey is not included because his retirement benefit is the new 401( k) plan.) Then, they translate all those future payments into todayâ€™s dollars with a rate  â€”   often called a discount rate. This is exactly how a lender would calculate a home mortgage. The problem is, which rate should be used? An economist would say the right rate for Calpers is the one for a   bond, like a Treasury bond, because public pensions in California are guaranteed by the state and therefore  . And thatâ€™s what Calpers does when it calculates market values. It used 2. 56 percent when it calculated the bill for the pest control district, producing a $447, 000 shortfall. But the rest of the time, Calpers and virtually all other public pension funds use their assumed annual rate of return on assets, now generally around 7. 5 percent. Presto: This makes a pension appear to have a much smaller liability  â€”   or even a surplus. That was the case with the pest control district for years. And since there seemed to be a surplus, Calpers said the district owed no annual contributions. Calpersâ€™s numbers hid it, but the six membersâ€™ pensions were going unfunded. â€œEvery economist who has looked at this has said, â€˜Itâ€™s crazy to use what you expect to earn on assets to discount a guaranteed promise you have made. Thatâ€™s nuts! â€™â€ Professor Sharpe said. But what he calls crazy is enshrined in the actuarial standards. And since adhering to the standards makes public pensions look affordable, there is a powerful incentive to preserve those standards. â€œActuaries shamelessly, although often in good faith, understate pension obligations by as much as 50 percent,â€ said Jeremy Gold, an actuary and economist, in a speech last year at the M. I. T. Center for Finance and Policy. â€œTheir clients want them to. â€ Mr. Gold was also a ringleader of that stormy professional meeting in 2003. Since then, there have been more conferences, monographs, speeches,   panels and recommendations  â€”   to say nothing of an unusual spate of municipal bankruptcies and insolvencies in which ailing pension plans have played starring roles. And yet little has changed. Even as Citrus Pest Control District No. 2 was scrambling to find the cash to pay its unexpected bill this year, another fight broke out within the American Academy of Actuaries, which represents the profession in Washington, over the same issues. An academy task force had commissioned a paper on how financial economists would measure public pensions. But during the peer review process, the opus was spiked, the task force disbanded and the four authors  â€”   Mr. Gold among them  â€”   barred from publishing the work elsewhere. Accusations of censorship flew. The four authors said the academyâ€™s copyright claims were false. The academyâ€™s president, Thomas F. Wildsmith IV, said in a statement to members on the academyâ€™s website that the paper â€œcould not meet the academyâ€™s publication standards. â€ In a separate email message to The New York Times he said the academy was committed to helping the public understand the different measurements, and provided a position paper concluding that both measures are useful, but for different purposes. Then the Society of Actuaries, which handles the education and testing of actuaries, joined the fray. It posted the suppressed paper on its own website, albeit with the authorsâ€™ names removed. It claimed to hold the copyright jointly with the academy. It also added a statement that the paper did not reflect the position â€œof any group that speaks for the professionâ€ but called the authors â€œknowledgeable. â€ The societyâ€™s president, Craig W. Reynolds, sent an email message citing other efforts â€œto develop strong funding programs that are responsive to a rapidly changing environment. â€ The four authors then issued a revised version of their paper, with their names on the front  â€”   and a claim that they held the copyright. The paper, which runs 19 pages, says in brief: Use market values for public pensions. Professor Sharpe noted that Calpersâ€™s   method was â€œvirtually the precise approach advocated in this paper. â€ Almost, but not entirely. At Citrus Pest Control District No. 2, Mr. Hoesterey said Calpers added a final twist. It took so long to calculate the districtâ€™s final payment that the bill arrived four months after the districtâ€™s withdrawal date  â€”   and then it charged four monthsâ€™ interest, at 7. 5 percent, on the late payment. Ms. Morgan, the spokeswoman, said the   lag was â€œunfortunate but unavoidable. â€ Mr. Hoesterey said Calpers should have warned the district well in advance how big the bill might be, to give it time to find the money. â€œI kept asking: â€˜Does this seem fair to you? What other organization conducts business like this? â€™â€ he said. Seeing no way out, the district paid the whole thing."
20893,How to Save the Conversation at Your Post-Election Thanksgiving Dinner,Pamela Bofferding,"Sometimes going home for the holidays is hard (thereâ€™s a reason liquor sales swell during these occasions!). Often, Thanksgiving dinners bring far-flung family members together at a single table under one roof, and that, even in the best of circumstances, can lead to stress and awkward conversations. Add in the fact that this is an election year and youâ€™re bound to encounter some strain while you pass those mashed potatoes across vastly different ideologies. Iâ€™ve heard from more than one friend or family member that they wonâ€™t be attending holiday dinners this year, and I think thatâ€™s really a shame.
Iâ€™d encourage anyone thinking about going that route to reconsider; the following tips can help to make your Thanksgiving dinner manageable and enjoyable and can help you focus on your familiesâ€™ similarities, rather than differences.
Remember the Golden Rule of Polite Conversation If youâ€™re an activist of any sort this may be difficult to adhere to, but the two topics that are best to leave on the coat hook are your religious and political views. Remember last year when Uncle Joe successfully convinced everyone at the table to convert to his exact religious and political beliefs? Yeah, that didnâ€™t happen. No matter how zealous your convictions, if you truly want to make the two hours of Thanksgiving dinner comfortable, you need to skip that kind of talk. Now is no time to be passive-aggressive either: leave the political-themed hats and t-shirts at home. Focus instead on the personal: how people are doing in their jobs, what hobbies they are participating in, how their kids are doing.
If someone tries to bait or lead you into a conversation that approaches one of the two danger zones, be nice but donâ€™t engage. I once escaped a horrible conversation with a distant cousin by complimenting her earrings. Really, this is no different than abstaining from talk about your digestive issues or the road kill you saw on the drive overâ€”itâ€™s just plain rude to go there. And if your family happens to all hold the exact same beliefs and convictions, well, how nice for you! (Though you should know that for years my family assumed I shared their same political opinions when I absolutely did notâ€”consider this might be the case for the person next to you at the table.)
Thankful for Place Settings When I host Thanksgiving dinner at my house, each place setting has a little piece of paper with the subject heading â€œI am thankful for:â€ and 5 blank lines. I also give out fountain pens like these as a little gift to my guests. As everyone is seated, they fill out their lists. We take turns over the course of the dinner reading our lists. This is a great way to focus on what really matters to us and to help us share in our gratitude.
Do Your Part Preparation is key in all situations, so having a couple of talking points in your conversation arsenal is smart. Avoid lulls in conversation by contributing. Think about something positive or meaningful that happened to you recentlyâ€”a beautiful place that you visited or a great (non-political!) book or movie that you sawâ€”and have an anecdote ready.
When all else fails, you can always talk about the food: what your favorite part of the meal is, how certain dishes were prepared, and how good the wine is (but go easy on the wine!).

20895,Trump Will Issue New Travel Order Instead of Fighting Case in Court - The New York Times,Adam Liptak,"WASHINGTON  â€”   The Justice Department told a federal appeals court on Thursday that it would not seek a rehearing of a decision that shut down President Trumpâ€™s targeted travel ban. Instead, the administration will start from scratch, issuing a new executive order, the department said. Last Thursday, a unanimous   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked the key parts of the original executive order, which suspended the nationâ€™s refugee program as well as travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The panel said the original ban was unlikely to survive constitutional scrutiny. The Justice Department said that the panelâ€™s decision was riddled with errors but that the flaws it noted would be addressed in the new executive order. â€œRather than continuing this litigation,â€ the Justice Departmentâ€™s brief said, â€œthe president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns. â€ â€œIn so doing,â€ the brief said, â€œthe president will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially   litigation. â€ In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the new executive order would be issued next week. In its brief, the Justice Department urged the appeals court to await the new order and then vacate last Thursdayâ€™s decision. It is not clear that the issuance of a new and narrower executive order will make the case before the Ninth Circuit moot or that the court will agree to vacate the decision even if it did. The Supreme Court has said the â€œvoluntary cessationâ€ of a government action does not usually make a case moot if the government remains free to resume the conduct after the case is dismissed. In calling for a legal   the Justice Department avoided a Supreme Court test of the original executive order. A    tie on the   Supreme Court would have left the panelâ€™s decision in place. Mr. Trumpâ€™s travel ban, issued Jan. 27, caused confusion and protests at airports nationwide and was immediately challenged in court. Many federal judges blocked aspects of the order. The broadest injunction was issued on Feb. 3 by Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle, acting in a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. Judge Robart required the administration to roll back the key aspects of the order, and travel from the affected countries resumed almost immediately. The next day, the Justice Department filed an emergency appeal, saying that national security concerns required immediate action from the appeals court. The   panel heard arguments a few days later, and in a unanimous decision last Thursday, it refused to reinstate the ban. Many legal scholars, including ones who disapproved of the ban, have criticized the reasoning in the panelâ€™s ruling. The Justice Departmentâ€™s brief tracked many of those critiques, saying the panelâ€™s decision was plagued by misunderstandings about the scope of the original executive order and the presidentâ€™s authority to address immigration. â€œIn other circumstances,â€ the brief said, â€œthe panelâ€™s multiple errors in sustaining a substantially overbroad injunction, and thereby prohibiting enforcement of a lawful executive order designed to protect the nationâ€™s security, would warrantâ€ review by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. â€œSuch review is not called for at this time,â€ the brief said, given the forthcoming executive order. In their own brief filed Thursday, Washington and Minnesota agreed with the administration on one thing: that no rehearing of the panelâ€™s decision was warranted. But the states argued that the panelâ€™s ruling had been careful and correct. â€œThe panelâ€™s order thoroughly considered the legal precedent and the partiesâ€™ arguments and neither overlooked nor misunderstood a point of law or fact,â€ the brief said. The briefs came in response to a request from the appeals court. Last Friday, an unidentified appeals court judge called for a vote on whether the   panelâ€™s ruling should be reheard by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. If a majority of the courtâ€™s active judges vote to rehear the case, it would typically be considered by an   panel made up of the circuitâ€™s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random. Rehearing motions filed by parties and requests for votes on rehearings requested by judges are not particularly unusual. The Ninth Circuit rehears decisions issued by   panels 15 to 25 times a year, the court said. The Ninth Circuit has 25 active judges 18 were appointed by Democratic presidents. Even if the Ninth Circuit agrees to vacate the panelâ€™s decision, challenges to the original executive order will continue in other courts. And the new executive order may draw fresh legal challenges."
20896,Egyptian Court Clears Way for Hosni Mubarakâ€™s Release - The New York Times,Declan Walsh,"CAIRO  â€”   Egyptâ€™s top appeals court cleared former President Hosni Mubarak of any responsibility for the killing of hundreds of people during the 2011 protests that ended his   rule, sweeping away the final legal hurdle to Mr. Mubarakâ€™s release from detention. The ruling drew cheers from Mr. Mubarakâ€™s supporters, who have in recent years cast off the stigma once associated with his name to air increasingly vocal demands for his release. But it represented a bitter landmark for the millions of Egyptians who risked their lives to oust Mr. Mubarak and his circle during the heady,   uprising in early 2011. None of the   figures who grew rich and influential during his time in power are still in jail. The sole exception is Mr. Mubarak himself, who has been under guard for years at the Maadi Military Hospital in Cairo, at a room overlooking the Nile. But the decision to keep him in detention is widely seen here as a political matter rather than a legal one  â€”   constructed to avoid any embarrassment to Egyptâ€™s current leader, President Abdel Fattah   who sometimes praises the 2011 revolution. In contrast, thousands of Egyptians who rose against him in 2011 are stuck in prison, in many cases after mass trials that drew stinging international criticism. The prisoners include supporters of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, but also activists, lawyers and journalists who dared to challenge Mr. Sisi. â€œItâ€™s pretty telling that Mubarak, who ran the country into the ground, gets acquitted, and people who gave their everything to try and do something for the country are sitting in prison,â€ said Ahdaf Soueif, an author whose nephew, the activist and blogger Alaa Abd El Fattah, is in jail. Some Egyptian prisoners have been held without trial for years, often in terrible conditions, in stark contrast with the relatively gilded conditions enjoyed by Mr. Mubarak. According to supporters who have visited him, Mr. Mubarak gets regular deliveries of flowers, newspapers and takeout restaurant meals, as well as a constant stream of visitors. Occasionally, Mr. Mubarak emerges onto the balcony to wave at cheering supporters gathered at the hospital gates. His sons Alaa and Gamal, who were convicted on charges of embezzling millions of dollars of state money, were released from prison in 2015 and are often sighted in restaurants and shops in upscale Cairo neighborhoods. In the past six years, Mr. Mubarak has faced a slew of criminal charges for corruption and misrule. He was often seen glowering with anger when he appeared in court and was forced to sit inside a cage. But he has been convicted in just one corruption case, which concluded in 2015 when an appeals court upheld a   sentence. The judge allowed Mr. Mubarak to count time served against the sentence. Alternately defiant or embittered, Mr. Mubarak never publicly displayed much contrition for his actions during his three decades in power. On Thursday he was flown by helicopter to the courtroom, where he sat in a wheelchair and smiled at supporters from the defendantâ€™s cage. Among those watching from the public gallery was his son Gamal, once groomed as his successor. Yousri Abdelraziq, a lawyer and Mubarak supporter who was present in court, said the former president was in a buoyant mood after his acquittal. â€œHe fully intends to go home, perhaps in a month or two,â€ he said. He suggested that Mr. Mubarak might want to go to his palatial villa at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, which was the subject of a different, failed corruption case. The final case against Mr. Mubarak centered on accusations that he ordered shootings by security forces that led to the deaths of 239 people during the 2011 uprising. In 2012, a court sentenced Mr. Mubarak to life in prison, but an appeals court ordered a retrial, which resulted in his initial acquittal in 2014. Thursdayâ€™s ruling confirmed that acquittal, prompting renewed speculation that Mr. Sisi might release Mr. Mubarak from detention, though it could prove politically awkward. In speeches, Mr. Sisi regularly pays tribute to the 2011 uprising, which was supported by the Egyptian military. â€œIf they let Mubarak out, what does that say about 2011  â€”   that the military got it wrong?â€ said Hisham A. Hellyer, author of â€œA Revolution Undone: Egyptâ€™s Road Beyond Revolt. â€ Still, Mr. Sisiâ€™s tenure is more strongly defined by the tumultuous events that brought him to power, when the military he led toppled the democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013. Since then Mr. Sisi has cracked down hard on the Brotherhood, while his supporters have sought to portray the events of 2011 as a result of foreign interference in Egypt. Some Egyptians believe that Mr. Sisi might want to free Mr. Mubarak before the presidential election set to take place next year, as a means of drawing a line under the 2011 uprising. Mr. Sisi himself has yet to make his views clear. Mr. Mubarak, for his part, has always insisted he did nothing wrong. After a list of charges against the former president was read aloud in court on Thursday  â€”   quite possibly for the last time  â€”   he responded curtly: â€œIt did not happen. â€"
20897,Russia Moves to Soften Domestic Violence Law - The New York Times,Ivan Nechepurenko,"MOSCOW  â€”   Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to decriminalize some forms of domestic battery for   offenders who do not do serious physical harm to their victims. Members of the State Duma passed the controversial amendment to the Russian criminal code in its second reading, which essentially assures it will go to President Vladimir V. Putin for his signature. The amendment treats a first conviction for domestic battery as an administrative offense, carrying a penalty of a $500 fine or 15 days in jail. If Mr. Putin signs the measure into law, only injuries like concussions or broken bones, or repeated offenses committed in a family setting, would lead to criminal charges. Defenders of the measure say it will protect parentsâ€™ rights to discipline their children and generally reduce the stateâ€™s role in domestic life. â€œIn the traditional Russian family culture, relations between â€˜fathers and sonsâ€™ are built upon the authority of parentsâ€™ power, mutual love and personal indispensability as the basis for childrenâ€™s upbringing,â€ said Yelena B. Mizulina, one of the initiators of the new legislation and author of a law that banned â€œgay propagandaâ€ aimed at minors. Opponents called it a step back to medieval times and a license for violent behavior by domestic tyrants. â€œIt is clear that lawmakers recognized violence as a norm of family life,â€ said Svetlana G. Aivazova, a Russian specialist in gender studies. â€œThis shows that Duma deputies are not simply conservative or traditional, it shows that they are archaic. â€ Ms. Aivazova and other experts say that Russia has a serious problem with domestic violence. Citing data provided by Russiaâ€™s Interior Ministry, Ms. Aivazova told Mr. Putin in 2015 that â€œ40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families. â€ In 2013, she said, more than 9, 000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11, 000 were badly injured. In 2014, she said, â€œmore than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families. â€ In the United States, by comparison, 11, 766 women were killed by a husband or boyfriend in the years 2001 to 2012, an average of about 1, 000 a year in a country with about twice the population of Russia. Ms. Aivazova asked Mr. Putin to support a special law on the prevention of domestic violence that had already been passed in 143 countries, including Russiaâ€™s   neighbors Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Mr. Putin thanked her, but the law remained in the State Duma, and Ms. Aivazova said she was not optimistic about its prospects. In the past, Mr. Putin has expressed concern about domestic violence, even in the absence of serious injury. â€œI think we should not slap children and justify it based on some old traditions,â€ he told journalists at his last news conference in December. â€œThere is a short distance from slaps to beating. â€ The new legislation was pushed by conservative members of the Russian parliament and the Russian Orthodox Church, who were incensed last summer when lawmakers criminalized domestic violence, acting upon a recommendation by the Supreme Court. The Russian Orthodox Church, which has steadily increased its influence in social policy in recent years, said in a statement last year that physical punishment was a Russian tradition and thus should be protected as â€œan essential right given to parents by God. â€ â€œThere is absolutely no doubt that children should be defended against true criminal activities,â€ the church said. â€œBut you cannot equate such criminal assaults with rational and moderate use of physical punishment by loving parents. â€ Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the new legislation was a sign of the stateâ€™s determination to â€œmake conditions for strong families to emerge. â€"
20898,Against Hillary's Malevolent Matriarchy,Ilana Mercer,"What feminists can learn from Melania Trump. October 28, 2016 Ilana Mercer 
In recent interviews, Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump, observed wryly that almost every malicious, lie-filled article about herself or he husband was written by a â€¦ female. Indeed, women seem to have a particular stake in bringing Mr. Trump down. 
The contrast between Mrs. Trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark. In both her interviews with CNN's condescending Anderson Cooper and Fox News's Ainsley Earhardt, Mrs. Trump was the embodiment of ""strength."" 
When a liberal woman declares she's a strong woman (usually uttered in a tart-like, staccato inflection), she's using a clichÃ©. Look at her actions. You'll see that ""strong"" to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways. 
A ""strong"" liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to fork-out for her Trojans and her Trivora. And if birth control fails our liberated libertine, then you're on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients. And don't dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man, any man. To doubt her is to harm her. 
It was not without significance that Hillary Clintonâ€™s first general election speech, in June, was before Planned Parenthood. At the time, media buried the story of one named Rajiv K. Fernando , who had donated to the Clinton Foundation and was given a seat as Hillaryâ€™s nuclear weapons advisor. Watching this, I was thinking endemic corruption, the $19 trillion debt, the dire jobs report, the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers. But Hillary and her gyno-brigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayer-paid dilation and curettage (D&C). 
Melania Trump, on the other hand, is authentically strong. 
In her refusal to impart salacious tell-all tidbits to interviewers, in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family; in her serene, gracious, and beautiful manners and bearingâ€”Mrs. Trump exemplifies a European woman's good breeding. She's a class act. Her enemies are the cultural underclass. 
Nor does Mrs. Trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her American counterparts. There are images on the Internet of presidents being inappropriate with women. In particular, you can watch a grainy YouTube clip of Barack Obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters. In another, the president, with France's Nicolas Sarkozy, is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by. Much to media chagrin, Melania refused to get worked up about the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in locker-room talk. 
Men will be men. If they're not saying it; they're thinking it. 
More material than her mien were Melania Trump's words of reason. On the Soviet-style witch-hunt launched against her husband with media mediation, she said this: â€œAll sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law. To accuse someone, man or woman, without evidence is damaging and unfair.â€ This was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney Tom Mesereau, about the Bill Cosby pile-on. Quit the feeding frenzy. Give the man his due process. Investigate the women, counseled Mesereau, Esq., at the time. 
The very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted Michelle Obama. The First Lady was lauded for an unhinged anti-Trump address to the nation's women. In a world where Americans have been beheaded on camera, women raped en masse on Europe's streets, and Christians exterminated in the Middle Eastâ€”the First Lady bewailed being ""shaken"" to her shallow core by raunchy words. ""I can't stop thinking about it,"" groaned Michelle about Mr. Trump's Access Hollywood indiscretion. It ""has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted."" 
The ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a Catholic priest by Muslim migrants in France: That's something ""I can't stop thinking about."" The machine-gunning of five Macy's shoppers and employees by a Turkish Muslim immigrant (Arcan Cetin), in my neck of the woods: That ""has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted."" Again, Mrs. Obama's pitiful case against Mr. Trump has strengthened nothing but her drama-queen credentials. 
Candidate Clinton crowed that Mrs. Obama's long whinge for women was a ""compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election, about who we are as Americans."" Indeed, the implicit case Michelle put to women is this: a mammoth national debt, a shrinking job market, rising lawlessness and racial strife, an annual intake of mostly Third-World immigrants exceeding 3 million, the dangers to life and limb of importing more Islam: fuhgeddaboudit. What counts, whimpered Michelle Obama, voice tremblingâ€”yes, Mrs. Obama almost brought herself to tearsâ€”was to ferret out microaggression, and find a safe-place to hunker down. 
As I write, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has stormed a stage somewhere for Hillary Clinton. Phony Pocahontas is hollering about the power of ""nasty women"" to immiserate. Clinton and Warren make for a resentful, domineering, power-hungry pair, whoâ€™ve made it big in life through the use of state power. The human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same. 
Whereas Trump rallies are packed with hope-filled, beaming faces; a Clinton-Warren affair is festooned with malevolent-looking, aggrieved women and their frightened, low-T houseboys. The background music: enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop â€œsingerâ€ like Katy Perry, whose out-of-tune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard, if not for the marvel of Auto-Tune. (Auto-Tune is the â€œholy grail of recordingâ€ that â€œcorrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments, in real time, without distortion or artifacts.â€ It was invented by a male engineer.) 
Shudder. 
If this melodramatic, neurotic message is the voice of America's womenâ€”and legions of Republican women have seconded itâ€”then count me with HER, with Melania."
20899,Multiple universes and enhanced life,Gillian,"Leave a reply Notes toward a theory of overlapping universes â€œIf everything is already connected to everything, as weâ€™re told, the universe would be one dead hot dog, long past its expiration date. We should, instead, be considering a universe of separated forces, and when they come in contact, they can produce sparks of surprise, novelty, spontaneous energy, and synchronous possibilitiesâ€¦â€ (The Magician Awakes, Jon Rappoport) â€œThe 19th French Impressionist painters were all dedicated to revealing light in nature. They made all their subjects bathe in it. But each painter pursued that goal in a different way, as if he were describing a different universe. Perhaps they were also showing the collision of several universesâ€¦â€ (The Magician Awakes) 
Jon Rappoport â€“ Consider a different way of looking at things: The life we are living has an invisible characteristic which is massively important. 
This characteristic is the meeting and overlapping of separate universes. 
When this phenomenon occurs, it produces what some people call synchronicity. The important thing is: this synchronicity is spontaneous in the moment and alive and vital and brimming with possibility. If we recognize it, it â€œfills the cup to the brimâ€ and spills over. It is abundant. 
Some physicists claim that, in order to make sense out of quantum theory, in order to track its implications, you need to accept multiple universes. 
If you wanted to move into even deeper waters, you would consider the proposition that such universes interconnect and overlap. 
During roughly the same period that quantum theory appeared, painters were exploring simultaneous universes. Cubism and Collage (Picasso, Braque), Surrealism (Dali, Max Ernst, Roberto Matta). Writers were moving that direction (Rimbaud, Andre Breton, Apollinaire, Jarry). 
Conceiving of this universe as one space-time continuum would naturally lead to the question, â€œWhy not more than one continuum?â€ 
Dreams, in their episodic unfolding, shift radically from one scene to another, and the dreamer isnâ€™t jolted out of sleep by the changes. He goes on the ride. Heâ€™s absorbed in the action. Heâ€™s a kind of explorer, on a search, and if the voyage takes him from one universe to another, so be it. 
But in waking time, we want our experience to be serial, to follow the rules. We want our language to bolster the rules. Subject, verb, object. And so we ask, as well, that our problems lead to solutions in a straight line. 
Occasionally, we might wonder whether there is an entirely different way to effect solutions, particularly when weâ€™re dealing with a stubborn or chronic problem. 
In a way, that was my impetus for developing what I call Magic Theater, based on Psychodrama, in which people would improvise roles in dialogue with each other. 
For example, when faced with Problem X, the person plays the role of â€œthe person who has already solved X.â€ And in this role, he speaks with â€œsomeone who is struggling with X.â€ 
A new situation is invented, where two separate universes, so to speak, collide and overlap. 
Or a person plays the role of Problem X itself and speaks as that problem, to someone who is playing the role of â€œan inhabitant of a universe in which Problem X could never exist.â€ 
In a general sense, you simply have two people play the roles of inhabitants of vastly different kinds of universes. They sit and talk to each other. 
In approaching the subject of simultaneous overlapping universes, the notion of synchronicity pops up. Thirty years ago, I used to walk around Los Angeles with my camera snapping hundreds of pictures. At the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, on a Saturday afternoon, I was standing outside the main building taking pictures of Rodinâ€™s large sculpture, The Burghers of Calais. A heavy-set woman wearing a long coat suddenly stepped into the scene and looked up at one of the Burghers. I caught her in the frame and snapped the shot. Later, when the black-and-white photo was developed, it turned out that her overhanging hair-do was nearly identical to the piled up arrangement of hair on the Burgher she was staring at. Her head was the same wedge shape as the Burgherâ€™s. The similarity and the dissonance (a metal man, a flesh-and-blood woman, from two different epochs) were startling. 
A few minutes later, inside the Museum, I was focusing my camera on a very large painting of several 18th-century courtesans reclining on a couch in a luxurious chamber hung with rich heavy curtains. This was just the kind of painting I would ordinarily pass without a second glance. Two girls stepped in front of the painting and looked up at it. I snapped several shots. Later, after developing them, I saw that the girls were wearing all sorts of costume bracelets and rings. The contrast between the girlsâ€™ and the courtesansâ€™ jewelry, and between the young fresh faces of the girls and the opulent experienced faces of the courtesans, was quite marvelousâ€”and the photo diminished the distance and separateness between the girls and the painting. The universe of the girls and universe of the painting suddenly met and overlapped. 
As a wandering photographer in Los Angeles, I experienced many of these spontaneous synchronicities. 
This was a different order of reality. I would never have found it, had I not been carrying a camera and taking pictures. It would have been invisible. But there it was, on film. 
I was prompted to think that the reality of the street is much more than we usually believe it to be. That â€œmoreâ€ is actually there, all the time. But we stumble past it. 
The â€œmoreâ€ is multiple universes. We ignore them, because weâ€™re trained to. 
Suppose we are actually living in multiple universes all the time, and the gist of it, all the time, is the spontaneity and surprise and novelty that imparts life and vitality to the whole operation. If we could see it. 
And we donâ€™t see it, because every time we experience a glimpse of it, we discount it as â€œfantasy,â€ and we stash those moments, as memories, in the place where they seem to belong, THE IMAGINATION. 
And then, by living with imagination, we re-discover simultaneous overlapping universesâ€¦. 
We expect and insist on a flow of cause and effect in space. Thatâ€™s the way we conceive of events. A to B to C to D. 
This is the story of investigation in this universe. And it works, of course. It works brilliantly. 
What happens in an engine? Trace the flow of energy through the working parts and out into another mechanical framework where the energy gets something done. A to B to C. 
Iâ€™m simply proposing an additional way of looking at events. 
As an analogy, take this odd view of magnetism. The piece of iron is already â€œattract-able.â€ It has that quality. And the quality involves vibration, motion, a reaching out. And then we have the magnet, which already has the quality called â€œcapable of attracting something.â€ And the magnet and the piece of iron are separate and simultaneous worlds. And it is this fact that gives strength to the overall attraction. The magnet and the piece of iron could forever exist as separate. They could never meet. They are self-contained worlds. They arenâ€™t inherently connected because of their â€œattitudesâ€ toward attraction. They are whole and separate. Then, when they come near each other, there is an explosion, an overlapping, which stems from what they already are. 
And in the same way, separate but simultaneous percolating of different processes in the body meet and overlap. Side by side â€œworldsâ€ operating in their own ways, in the body, create a condition of health. 
Imagine that each â€œworldâ€ in the body exudes energy radiations, its own particular DIFFERENT radiations. The neurotransmitters do. The hormones do. The blood system does. The digestive system does. The immune system does. And so on. And when all these distinct and different energy outputs, as multiple universes, meet and overlap, you get health. 
We are tuned to say, â€œWell, health is expected and understood when everything is working well. We know about health. Weâ€™re very familiar with it.â€ But suppose the situation I described aboveâ€”separate universes in the body simultaneously existing side by sideâ€”IS REALLY A SYNCHRONICITY, in the sense that its nature is surprise. A thing that wasnâ€™t predicted and isnâ€™t blandly familiar at all. Just as people you never expected to be walking on the street at the same moment are showing up on the same street at the same moment, and you never notice that surprise because youâ€™re trained to expect the category called â€œpeople walking on the same streetâ€â€”in that same sense, these worlds of operation in the body are all about surprise and novelty and are really of a fantastic natureâ€”and THAT is somehow why health appears. 
Spontaneity, over and over and over again. 
And suppose we are actually living in multiple universes all the time, and the gist of it, all the time, is the spontaneity and surprise and novelty of the overlappings. 
And we donâ€™t see it, because every time we experience a glimpse of it, we discount it as â€œfantasy,â€ and we stash those moments in the place where they seem to belong, THE IMAGINATION. 
Many people, these days, want to say â€œTOGETHER, not SEPARATE.â€ They have their reasons, which are too tiresome to rehash. Iâ€™m suggesting that separate can be brilliant, can imply simultaneity, spontaneity, the juice of life, multiple universes. 
After all, when physicists say â€œmultiple universes,â€ do you immediately jump in and say, â€œWell, theyâ€™re just one really big universeâ€? Do you? Or do you admit the fascination of OTHER universes not inextricably bound to the same laws as this one? Other places, other events, other people, different, thrilling. 
When you dream, do you tell yourself all dreams are actually one big glob of dreaming, or do you jump in and explore the unique landscape in front of you in the dream youâ€™re in? And isnâ€™t it exciting when one dream collides with the next one, and you make the jumpâ€”from one universe to another? 
Soâ€¦what makes the life we know interesting and intriguing and thrilling and worth living is actually: the collision of multiple universes that naturally deliver spontaneity, surprise, novelty, and synchronicities that give us the chance of discovering new paths and roads and futures. 
And along those roads, we can invent greater futures than we had previously imaginedâ€¦

20901,Former GOP Representative Calls For Armed Insurrection (VIDEO),Carrie MacDonald,"Former GOP Representative Calls For Armed Insurrection (VIDEO) By Carrie MacDonald on October 27, 2016 
Former Representative Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) has called for armed insurrection if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wins the election. Walsh: â€˜Iâ€™m Grabbing My Musketâ€™ 
Joe Walsh is a stain on the history of my little part of the country. He served for a blessedly short time before being demolished by Representative Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) in the 2012 election, but he still has ardent supporters around here. Heâ€™s relatively well-known for his outrageous tweets, but this one, posted on October 26, made some real waves: On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
â€” Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Wow. 
I will grant that a musket is not going to do you much good these days. So perhaps, PERHAPS, it was a metaphor. 
But what does this say to the droves of Trump supporters, armed with much more than a musket, who believe the election will be stolen from their anointed one? 
Walsh, facing both harsh criticism and hilarious jabs on Twitter for his comment, did not back down: I'm serious. I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ 
â€” Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Yahoo! News interviewed Walsh about the comment, and he said : â€œIâ€™m not talking about inciting violence. Iâ€™m saying, â€˜If Trump loses, man, game on, grab your musket. Weâ€™re going to protest. Weâ€™re going to boycott. Weâ€™re going to picket. Weâ€™re going to march on Washington. Weâ€™re going to stop paying taxes. Weâ€™re going to practice civil disobedience.â€™ Whatever it takes.â€ 
This has become the standard operating procedure of Republicans, particularly Trump-supporting Republicans. Make veiled threats and then walk them back (â€œAww, câ€™mon, I was kidding! Canâ€™t you guys take a joke?â€), but make sure the knuckle-draggers who support them get wind of it. Itâ€™s disgusting. 
This morning, Walsh tweeted: I told Thomas Jefferson gov forced a baker out of biz for defending her religious beliefs. 
""Can't happen here"" he said. ""Grab your musket!"" 
â€” Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 27, 2016 
While this tweet is asinine on so many levels, it also suggests that he wasnâ€™t speaking metaphorically in his initial tweet. After all, in Jeffersonâ€™s time, muskets were one of the weapons of choice. Walsh Is A Disgrace 
Language like this has no place in political discourse. If Walsh were nothing more than the radio host he currently is, it would be disgusting. Given that he used to be a representative in the United States Congress, it is downright abhorrent. 
Itâ€™s also not the first time Walsh has suggested violence. 
After the shooting of several police officers in Dallas this summer, Walsh tweeted â€” and later deleted â€” the following: Screenshot via Chicago Tribune 
So itâ€™s really not out of the question to think heâ€™s actually looking to incite violence with his â€œgrabbing my musketâ€ comment. 
Iâ€™m just happy his Congressional office is no longer sullying the quaint town square.

20903,Comparisons? Golden State Warriors Are Playing a Different Game - The New York Times,Harvey Araton,"What is the point, really, of historical comparison? How do you measure a basketball mutation, which is what the Golden State Warriors have become, with their   dialing that makes comparing them with storied N. B. A. teams of yore like distinguishing between a smartphone and a land line? You watched Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson dishearten and finally defeat a resolute Oklahoma City team on Monday night in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. You watched them make   shots over the outstretched arms of men much taller, and you found yourself saying the unbelievable, ridiculous, stupefied words you mouth when you canâ€™t quite believe what youâ€™re seeing. It is practically a reinvented game these   Splash Brothers are playing, having drastically extended the standard scoring range, the acceptable area from which to consistently unload and succeed. After the Warriors had finally moved on to an N. B. A. finals rematch with LeBron James and his Cleveland Cavaliers with a   victory over the Thunder, someone asked the    Russell Westbrook what Curry had showed him late in the series that was missing earlier. Westbrook said, impassively: â€œOur bigs on the switches came out, and he made some tough shots over the top of them. â€ Westbrook should have added that there was nothing negligent, or lazy, about the Thunderâ€™s defensive resolve in Game 7. The high screens forced Steven Adams and Serge Ibaka to the perimeter time and again to cover Curry or Thompson. Adams is a   weighing 255 pounds Ibaka is listed at   245. Big men are typically at a disadvantage in isolation against smaller, more creative players, but Adams and Ibaka are earnest, athletic defenders who contested and occasionally deflected a Curry or Thompson launch earlier in the series. Is it easy shooting over an aggressive, skyscraping wingspan,   sidestepping, creating just enough space to release with   accuracy from that far away? Try it sometime. See how it goes. Curry hit seven   in Game 7. Thompson, coming off a   playoff record of 11 3s (on 18 attempts) in the crucial Game 6 in Oklahoma City, nailed six. In the fourth quarter, they were daggers to the heart of a team more than holding its own from inside the   line. Curry and Thompson each surpassed the previous individual high of 28   (held by Ray Allen and Dennis Scott) made in a single N. B. A. playoff series, Curry with 32, Thompson with 30. Amid it all, Bill Simmons posted on Twitter that 30 years ago, in the 1986 finals, Boston and Houston combined to hit 17   shots in an entire   series won by the Celtics. Those familiar with Simmons, late of ESPN and now with HBO, will know that he is an unapologetic Celtics fan. And that Boston team, anchored by Larry Bird, won 67 games in   losing once at home, and certainly staked its claim as one of the greatest in N. B. A. history. Many of us who covered sports in that decade have argued that it was the N. B. A. â€™s best blend of   fundamentals combined with the arrival of a   athleticism that would manifest itself in the 1990s marketing miracle that became Michael Jordan. The Lakers of the   to late 1980s  â€”   a team that included Mychal Thompson, Klayâ€™s father  â€”   belong in any   conversation, given the prime of Magic Johnsonâ€™s career, the   Kareem   and the Hall of Fame gifts of James Worthy. But it was Jordanâ€™s Chicago Bulls team of   that won 72 games and the fourth of six championships in eight seasons that these   Warriors are running a mythical race against. Make no mistake: A generation of Jordan worshipers was poised to gloat had the Thunder been able to close out the Warriors. It will be again if James can deliver a championship to Cleveland. For all their titles, perhaps the true appraisal of the   Bulls came in the   season, when Jordan walked away to flail at minor league breaking balls. Scottie Pippen and a cast unintentionally derided as â€œsupportingâ€ won 55 games. They proved to be much more than a backup band, the Jordanaires, when they came within one highly questionable foul call on Pippen of going home with a chance to finish off the Knicks and advance to the Eastern Conference finals. But what they lacked without Jordan was another closer, or coldblooded scorer, to achieve what Thompson did when he dropped 41 points on the Thunder in Game 6. A year ago, on the Warriorsâ€™ way to the franchiseâ€™s first title since 1975, all four of their opponents dealt with manpower shortages. This time around, they had to push on in the first two rounds against Houston and Portland without the injured Curry, the leagueâ€™s   most valuable player. Against the Thunder, the Warriors had to deal with Draymond Green slumping and flirting with suspension while they fell into a     hole. With the confidence of Westbrook and Kevin Durant soaring, with Curry struggling to reclaim his rhythm, the Warriors still rallied for three straight victories against a long and talented team that had taken out the   San Antonio Spurs. Now the Warriorsâ€™ reward is James, a   champion with Miami and an N. B. A. finalist for the sixth straight season, and a Cavaliers team at full strength. â€œI think any time you go through a long postseason, you grow,â€ Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. â€œNow that weâ€™ve been through this together for two years, going deep in the playoffs, I guess we played 21, 22 playoff games last year, and now weâ€™re at 16, maybe 17. I havenâ€™t really kept track, but thatâ€™s a lot of playoff games. Thatâ€™s a lot of pressure, a lot of circumstances that come your way. â€ And that may be our truest basis for comparing teams from different eras, rules and styles: What and whom must a champion endure and overcome? The Warriors made 73 wins look almost too easy, tempting those commonly referred to as haters to question or deride the quality of the competition, in the interests of historical context. Forget all that now. Extreme playoff adversity has been met and surmounted, and here comes LeBron. This Warriors title defense has taken on a degree of difficulty as formidable as the nightly audacity of their   marksmen. If Curry and Thompson continue making them, even the haters may have to mimic Joe Lacob, the Warriorsâ€™ owner, who, upon spotting Thompson after Game 6, went down on one knee and bowed."
20904,"A Jewish Playerâ€™s 1914 Baseball Card Triggers a $125,000 Dispute - The New York Times",Ben Berkon,"More than a hundred years after Guy Zinn last appeared in a   game, his baseball card is causing a commotion. The fuss has nothing to do with Zinnâ€™s skill. His playing career yielded some distinctions  â€”   including his being one of 11 players to steal home twice in a game and appearing as the first batter in Fenway Park. But most of his statistics over five   seasons, including a . 269 career batting average, suggest that he was a very ordinary athlete. The trait that set Zinn apart, and made his baseball card unusually valuable, was his ethnicity. Zinn was Jewish, which all but guaranteed him a following for generations. A fan subculture has long coalesced around Jewish ballplayers, so much so that their cards have a special category on eBay. Jeff Aeder, a Chicago real estate developer, is one of the most prominent figures in that subculture, and a 1914 Zinn card owned by a Maryland man has become, as other collectors describe it, Aederâ€™s holy grail. It is believed to be the only card of its type still in existence. Aeder offered $125, 000 for the card in 2014 and nearly claimed it. But the deal went sour at the last minute. Aeder balked because, he said, he received a poor appraisal of the cardâ€™s condition. The owner, Dan McKee of Baltimore County, refused to renegotiate. â€œI blocked his email,â€ said McKee, who bought the card for $2, 500 in 1995 at a show in Fort Washington, Pa. â€œI donâ€™t do business like that. If you make a deal, you make a deal. â€ â€œIf Zinn was not a Jewish player, this card is probably worth $10, 000,â€ Aeder said. â€œIf you talk to any dealer or collector, theyâ€™ll say McKeeâ€™s idea of value is the most overblown, crazy valuation of all time. â€ So why was Aeder willing, at one point, to pay $125, 000? â€œIt really is something that if you have the means and the obsession, then someone pays a lot more than itâ€™s worth,â€ he said. Aeder and McKee, both 54, remain in a bitter standoff that highlights how passions that sprout in childhood can drive the sports memorabilia market. â€œZinn was not a significant player. The card, and the brouhaha surrounding it, is more interesting than the man,â€ said John Thorn, the official historian for Major League Baseball. â€œIf anything, it illustrates something so interesting about the hobby, the acquisitiveness about the fan. There is this transfer of power by owning this thing. â€ McKee, a software engineer who now works part time, became a collector when he was 7 and ultimately concentrated on unique cards and sets. McKee periodically posts some of his cards on auction websites  â€”   mostly out of curiosity, he said. He tends to list his items at exorbitant prices because, he said, he loathes parting with any card. â€œI got stuff up in my eBay store that is actually part of my collection,â€ McKee said in a telephone interview. â€œAnd every now and then, somebody hits the â€˜buy it nowâ€™ button and Iâ€™ll scream. â€ He did sell an 1894 Baltimore Orioles set  â€”   which was produced by the Alpha Photo Engraving Company  â€”   for six figures in 2006. McKee said the transaction had helped pay for his current home, but he declined to specify the sales price or the worth of his overall collection, which he called â€œtoo valuable to admit to. â€ McKee displays much of his memorabilia in open cabinets and a World War II map case that he received from his Army National Guard unit. The more valuable items, however, are kept in safes. â€œI keep a   in each one,â€ he said, then added dryly, â€œbut Iâ€™d rather not use it if I donâ€™t have to. â€ Aeder also started collecting as a boy, while growing up in a family that, he has said, included Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax in its Yom Kippur prayers to honor his choice not to play in Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on the holiday. When Aeder was in his 30s, he said, he decided to sell his entire collection at a card show. That plan did not work out. â€œInstead of selling, I wound up spending every penny on me buying new cards,â€ he said. After completing the sets from his childhood, he turned to collecting the cards of Jewish baseball players. â€œMany collectors are happy just to get one card of each player,â€ said Martin Abramowitz of Newton, Mass. whose collection ended up with Aeder after Abramowitz sold it to someone else to help pay for his daughterâ€™s wedding. â€œJeff is determined to get every card of every Jewish player. â€ Aeder sees curating such artifacts as an extension of the philanthropy that prompted Chicago Magazine to pick him and his wife, Jennifer Levine, as its â€œChicagoans of the Yearâ€ in 2013. Among other things, the couple founded the Wolcott School for children with learning disabilities and Miltâ€™s Barbecue for the Perplexed, a kosher restaurant that donates all of its profits to charity. In March, Aeder introduced the online Jewish Baseball Museum. â€œMy idea was to celebrate both the rich history of Jews in America and how baseball was an opportunity to fit in,â€ he said. â€œAnd today, now that they fit in, itâ€™s an opportunity for them to feel more Jewish. â€ McKee said he had no idea that Zinn was Jewish when he bought his card more than 20 years ago. McKee valued it for another reason. It was part of one of three sets that appeared as an insert in The Baltimore News and that provided a full season schedule on the back of each card. A 1914 version of these     included the first card ever made of Zinn, who was then in his fourth season and playing for the Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League. Unlike the more popular cards of that era, which were produced by the American Tobacco Company, the   were made from relatively thin material  â€”   like that of a playing card, but without the slick coating  â€”   and they were mostly discarded at the close of a season. As a result, few exist today. McKee said he had discovered 50 cards from the three   sets some of them turned up as markers in old books. Aeder first spotted the Zinn card in 2014 on McKeeâ€™s eBay store, where it was originally listed in 2010 as one of McKeeâ€™s â€œshow and tellâ€ items  â€”   for $250, 000. â€œHe wrote me and offered me $10, 000,â€ McKee said. â€œHe rubbed me wrong, right off the bat. â€ At Aederâ€™s behest, McKee said, he took a vacation day from his job to drive four hours to New Jersey to have the card authenticated  â€”   or â€œslabbedâ€  â€”   at the Sportscard Guaranty Company. â€œI wasnâ€™t even going to try to get a number,â€ McKee said. But the company also rated the card, giving it a one out of 10. â€œItâ€™s a   card,â€ McKee said. â€œBut itâ€™s technical grade  â€”   because of the blue all the way to the edge, it has some chipping, it has a crease, it has some paper loss on the back  â€”   theyâ€™re never going to give it more than a one or a 1. 5. â€ The final grade disturbed Aeder. â€œThe pictures he had sent did not look like it was a one,â€ Aeder said. McKee said Aeder had suddenly begun overstating the importance of the cardâ€™s condition. Aeder did ask about it in their first email exchange, McKee said, â€œand I answered: â€˜The only one known. Thatâ€™s the only condition you need to know. â€™â€ At an impasse, McKee and Aeder parted ways. They say they have not been in contact since. â€œIâ€™m coming to terms with the fact that I may never own the Zinn card,â€ Aeder said. â€œWell, at least, I know I will never buy it from Dan McKee. â€ But both he and McKee hold out hope that another Zinn   card could still turn up somewhere. â€œI have hopes that thereâ€™s plenty more of those out there,â€ McKee said. â€œThat Iâ€™m going to find. â€"
20905,"Putin Led a Complex Cyberattack Scheme to Aid Trump, Report Finds - The New York Times",Michael D. Shear and David E. Sanger,"WASHINGTON  â€”   President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a vast cyberattack aimed at denying Hillary Clinton the presidency and installing Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office, the nationâ€™s top intelligence agencies said in an extraordinary report they delivered on Friday to Mr. Trump. The officials presented their unanimous conclusions to Mr. Trump in a   briefing at Trump Tower in New York that brought the leaders of Americaâ€™s intelligence agencies face to face with their most vocal skeptic, the   who has repeatedly cast doubt on Russiaâ€™s role. The meeting came just two weeks before Mr. Trumpâ€™s inauguration and was underway even as the electoral votes from his victory were being formally counted in a joint session of Congress. Soon after leaving the meeting, intelligence officials released the declassified,  damning report that described the sophisticated cybercampaign as part of a continuing Russian effort to weaken the United States government and its democratic institutions. The report  â€”   a virtually     revelation by the American intelligence agencies that undermined the legitimacy of the president who is about to direct them  â€”   made the case that Mr. Trump was the favored candidate of Mr. Putin. The Russian leader, the report said, sought to denigrate Mrs. Clinton, and the report detailed what the officials had revealed to President Obama a day earlier: Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory followed a complicated, multipart cyberinformation attack whose goal had evolved to help the Republican win. The   report did not conclude that Russian involvement tipped the election to Mr. Trump. The public report lacked the evidence that intelligence officials said was included in a classified version, which they described as information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates. Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from â€œimplantsâ€ that the United States and its allies have put in Russian computer networks. Much of the unclassified report focused instead on an overt Kremlin propaganda campaign that would be unlikely to convince skeptics of the reportâ€™s more serious conclusions. The report may be a political blow to Mr. Trump. But it is also a risky moment for the intelligence agencies that have become more powerful since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but have had to fend off allegations that they exaggerated intelligence during the buildup to the Iraq war. The declassified report did describe in detail the efforts of Mr. Putin and his security services, including the creation of the online Guccifer 2. 0 persona and DCLeaks. com to release information gained from the hacks to the public. â€œPutin and the Russian Government aspired to help   Trumpâ€™s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,â€ the report by the nationâ€™s intelligence agencies concluded. Mr. Trump, whose resistance to that very conclusion has led him to repeatedly mock the countryâ€™s intelligence services on Twitter since Election Day, issued a written statement that appeared to concede some Russian involvement. But Mr. Trump said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin had sought to aid his candidacy, other than insisting that he still believes the Russian attacks had no effect on the outcome. The  â€™s written statement came just hours after Mr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview that the storm surrounding Russian hacking was nothing more than a â€œpolitical witch huntâ€ carried out by his adversaries, who he said were embarrassed by their loss to him in the 2016 election. Speaking by telephone three hours before the intelligence briefing, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intense focus on Russia. â€œChina, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names,â€ he said, referring to the breach of computers at the Office of Personnel Management in late 2014 and early 2015. â€œHow come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt. â€ Later, Mr. Trump sought to blame the Democrats for any cyberattacks that might have occurred. â€œGross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place,â€ he said in a Twitter message posted about 11 p. m. â€œThe Republican National Committee had strong defense!â€ Vice   Mike Pence told reporters that he and Mr. Trump had â€œappreciated the presentationâ€ by the intelligence officials and described the conversation as â€œrespectful. â€ Mr. Pence said the new administration would take aggressive action â€œto combat cyberattacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future. â€ Mr. Trump, who has consistently questioned the evidence of Russian hacking during the election, did so again Friday before he met with the intelligence officials. Asked why he thought there was so much attention on the Russian cyberattacks, the   said the motivation was political. He also repeated his criticism of the American intelligence agencies, saying that â€œa lot of mistakes were madeâ€ in the past, noting in particular the attacks on the World Trade Center and saying, as he has repeatedly, that â€œweapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time. â€ But after meeting with the intelligence officials, Mr. Trump appeared to moderate his position, conceding that â€œRussia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyberinfrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee. â€ The report described a broad campaign of covert operations, including the â€œtrollingâ€ on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russiaâ€™s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining â€œaccess to elements of multiple U. S. state or local electoral boards,â€ it concluded  â€”   as officials have publicly  â€”   that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8. The report, reflecting the assessments of the C. I. A. the F. B. I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election. â€œWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,â€ the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American â€œpolitical processesâ€ or public opinion. The intelligence agencies also concluded â€œwith high confidenceâ€ that Russiaâ€™s main military intelligence unit, the G. R. U. created a â€œpersonaâ€ called Guccifer 2. 0 and a website, DCLeaks. com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta. When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G. R. U. â€œrelayed material it acquired from the D. N. C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. â€ The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published. The role of RT  â€”   the Russian   news organization that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation  â€”   in the Kremlinâ€™s effort to influence the election is covered in far more detail by the report than any other aspect of the Russian campaign. An annex in the report on RT, which was first written in 2012 but not previously made public, takes up eight pages of the reportâ€™s   main section. The reportâ€™s unequivocal assessment of RT presents an awkward development for Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who is Mr. Trumpâ€™s choice to serve as national security adviser. Mr. Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RTâ€™s news programs and in December 2015 was paid by the network to give a speech in Russia and attend its lavish anniversary party, where he sat at the elbow of Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn has since defended his speech, insisting that RT is no different from CNN or MSNBC. The report also stated that Russia collected data â€œon some   targets,â€ but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested. Intelligence officials who prepared the classified report have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow hacked into the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions. The British role, which has been closely held, is a critical part of the timeline because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or informants outside the United States, as emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee flowed out of the country. The conclusions in the report were described on Thursday to President Obama and on Friday to Mr. Trump by James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence John O. Brennan, the director of the C. I. A. Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. The key to the public reportâ€™s assessment is that Russiaâ€™s motives â€œevolved over the course of the campaign. â€ When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused â€œon undermining her future presidency,â€ with   bloggers preparing a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #DemocracyRIP. It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011. Yet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s networks. Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until â€œat least June 2016,â€ the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks."
20906,â€œObama Set Up the Next President For a Major Recessionâ€â€¦ And A Giant Crash Is Coming,Contributing Author,"
This article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at his Economic Collapse blog . 
Editorâ€™s Comment: The past many months have carried a lot of noise about the coming crash, about a tipping point that may be fast approaching. The economics are simply giving way, and they canâ€™t hold the illusion forever. Now that Donald Trump will be calling the shots, the money powers can usher in collapse if they wish, and have ready their scapegoat. It wonâ€™t just be Trump the man or the president, but the people who elected him, who backed Brexit and who gave up on their system. They people who let loose the chaos that now consumes us. 
Their rage, their anger and their desperation is brewing unrest. The ascent of populism in the political arena has put the establishment in retreat, and revealed, at last, a most dangerous atmosphere, from which collapse can properly precipitate â€¦ one in which all regulatory steadiness on the part of the system has been thrown off balance and out of whack by popular revolt. By the time the hammer falls, and the markets fall to the ground, the people rioting in the streets and losing their civility when ATMs stop working and store shelves go empty â€“ these people will become the face of the disaster. The banks have been planning the next rise and fall for sometime; the next phase is all digital, and tightly monitored and controlled. 
We Are Being Set Up For Higher Interest Rates, A Major Recession And A Giant Stock Market Crash 
by Michael Snyder
Since Donald Trumpâ€™s victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in 15 years . Global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since November 8th, and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead. The general consensus in the investing community is that a Trump administration will mean much higher inflation, and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates. Unfortunately for all of us, history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown. And this makes perfect sense, because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money. The Obama administration had already set up the next president for a major recession anyway, but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later.
For those that are not familiar with the bond market, when yields go up bond prices go down. And when bond prices go down, that is bad news for economic growth.
So we generally donâ€™t want yields to go up.
Unfortunately, yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of weeks, and the yield on 10 year Treasury notes has now jumped â€œone full percentage point since Julyâ€ â€¦
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.36% in late trading on Friday, the highest since December 2015, up 66 basis point since the election, and up one full percentage point since July!
The 10-year yield is at a critical juncture. In terms of reality, the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the Fed in December, after a year of flip-flopping. A slew of post-election pronouncements by Fed heads â€“ including Yellenâ€™s â€œrelatively soonâ€ â€“ have pushed the odds of a rate hike to 98%.
As I noted the other day , so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on U.S. Treasury notes. Just look at what is happening to mortgages. As Wolf Richter has noted , the average rate on 30 year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphereâ€¦
The carnage in bonds has consequences. The average interest rate of the a conforming 30-year fixed mortgage as of Friday was quoted at 4.125% for top credit scores. Thatâ€™s up about 0.5 percentage point from just before the election, according to Mortgage News Daily . It put the month â€œon a short list of 4 worst months in more than a decade.â€ 
If mortgage rates continue to shoot higher, there will be another housing crash.
Rates on auto loans, credit cards and student loans will also be affected. Throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow money, and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down.
Why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from Steve Bannon â€¦
In a nascent administration that seems, at best, random in its beliefs, Bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice, but almost a messianic one:
â€œLike [Andrew] Jacksonâ€™s populism, weâ€™re going to build an entirely new political movement,â€ he says. â€œItâ€™s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. Iâ€™m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, itâ€™s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. Weâ€™re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution â€” conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.â€
Steve Bannon is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new Trump administration, and he is absolutely determined to get this â€œtrillion dollar infrastructure planâ€ through Congress.
And that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add 2.4 trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year.
Sadly, all of this comes at a time when the U.S. economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down. It is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in year-over-year earnings for the S&P 500, and industrial production has now contracted for 14 months in a row .
The truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time now, and it isnâ€™t going to take much to push us over the edge. The following comes from Lance Roberts â€¦
With an economy running at below 2%, consumers already heavily indebted, wage growth weak for the bulk of Americanâ€™s, there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes.
Combine weak economics with higher interest rates, which negatively impacts consumption, and a stronger dollar, which weighs on exports, and you have a real potential of a recession occurring sooner rather than later. 
Yes, the stock market soared immediately following Trumpâ€™s election, but it wasnâ€™t because economic conditions actually improved.
If you look at history, a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash. So if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders.
And history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession. If the economy suffers a major downturn early in the Trump administration, it is inevitable that stock prices will follow.
The waning days of the Obama administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest rates, a major recession and a giant stock market crash.
Of course any problems that occur after January 20th, 2017 will be blamed on Trump, but the truth is that Obama will be far more responsible for what happens than Trump will be.
Right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because Donald Trump won the election.
That is an enormous mistake.
A shaking has already begun in the financial world, and this shaking could easily become an avalanche.
Now is not a time to party. Rather, it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead.
All of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed slightly, but without a doubt they are still on the way.
So get prepared while you still can, because time is running out.

20907,How I Created My Very First Garden From Scratch - The New York Times,Michelle Slatalla,"MILL VALLEY, Calif.  â€”   â€œRemind me again why we bought this house?â€ my husband asked. He was standing on the front porch a few days after we finally moved into our cottage here, after the   odyssey of buying it, renting it out while an architect drew plans for an addition and, finally, living like nomads with various friends as the promised four months of construction stretched into six. â€œFor the garden,â€ I said. â€œWhat garden?â€ he asked, not unkindly. He was genuinely perplexed. I love him, but he is not a gardener. He did not see that this garden was a rare find in our hilly town. For one thing, it had a flat, sunny backyard, which would enable an outdoor living room to connect seamlessly with the kitchen, creating a bonus room during the nine months of the year when the weather is pleasant. And the house was set unusually far back from the street, producing privacy and an illusion that a small, gently sloped front garden was actually large. Where my husband saw a recently active construction zone with souvenir dirt piles, I could imagine a landscape of rosemary and daphnes in a boxwood maze. Where he saw sad remnants of the contractorsâ€™ orange mesh safety fencing, I envisioned a silvery hedge of pittosporum. Where he saw a broken concrete path churned up by the roots of an angry cedar tree (â€œa lawsuit waiting to happenâ€) I pictured a neat redbrick walkway marching up to a tiled front stoop. Also, that cedar tree, the one aspect of the landscape that still looked alive? I saw the tree surgeon coming on Monday with a chain saw. Creating a garden is a leap of faith because, unlike an interior renovation, a landscape is alive, and that makes it fragile. I have always been a gardener. But as recently as four years ago, when this conversation with my husband occurred, I was very much a dabbler. The three other houses we had owned had a garden, but previous tenants had designed them. I was just the caretaker. The situation at hand would require more. I had to start from scratch. Despite clues that a   occupant had been a gardener, the property had fallen into neglect even before the renovation. And now the pitiless blades of the backhoes that dug a new foundation had created a Mad Max hellscape of   dirt. A   landscape is not uncommon after a major renovation. Neither is a tight budget. But lucky for me and my garden, as we moved into this house, I also became the editor of a new gardening website called Gardenista. (Our new book, â€œGardenista: The Definitive Guide to Outdoor Spaces,â€ is out this month.) I am actually supposed to spend my workdays learning how to improve my own garden. I figured Iâ€™d take it slow to avoid making expensive mistakes. But my dogs had other plans. My two tiny papillons, Sticky and Larry, spent their days prancing around the dust field formerly known as the backyard and leaving paw prints all over the newly refinished wood floors. An emergency bluestone patio put an end to the paw prints by creating a buffer zone between the backyard and house. After agonizing over how to lay the stone, I chose a running bond pattern  â€”   simple offset rows of pavers  â€”   instead of herringbone, and making that first design decision emboldened me. So now what? Every garden designer needs a plan for hardscape ( fixed elements like patios, paths and retaining walls) softscape (the plants) and furnishings  â€”   and some inspiration. My plan was to work in stages to keep the budget under control, addressing separately the backyard, front garden and driveway of my small lot. A main consideration was the water shortage in California: My garden needed to be   as well as beautiful. For inspiration, I had the   gardener who once had lived in my house. As we began to clear vines and underbrush from the perimeter of the property, we uncovered gifts she had left behind, including an ornate metal trellis we transformed into a gate and an old concrete birdbath. First I tackled the small back garden. With a bluestone patio in place, we had the beginnings of an outdoor living room. I needed to furnish it (a teak daybed came to the rescue) and turn the rest of the landscape into a serene, calming backdrop. To cover the fence, my husband and I planted espaliered olive trees and white climbing roses in deep garden beds. We limited the use of turf grass to a    patch. By then, I had become obsessed with the Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolfâ€™s environmentally conscious meadows of flowering perennials and grasses. When it came time to work on our front garden (where the sudden demise of the cedar tree had opened up a sunny spot) I laid out a miniature meadow inspired by Mr. Oudolfâ€™s planting scheme for the High Line in New York City. With space roughly the size of two football fields, Mr. Oudolf had to create a coherent narrative along a route from the West Village to the edge of Hellâ€™s Kitchen. In my front garden, roughly the size of a badminton court, the square footage presented a different challenge: How do you make a small space with a brick path running through the middle of it look like a meadow instead of a muddle? The solution was to divide the space and to plant the meadow on only one side of the path. In the other half of the front garden is a quieter space where a low hedge of rosemary surrounds a square of boxwood, which encloses a ring of daphnes planted at the base of an olive tree. I think the reason this juxtaposition of wildness and formality works instead of looking like the crazy experiments of a mad scientist is that the front garden slopes gently up from the street. The change in elevation as you move through the space makes you feel as if you are on a journey, and your eye is drawn to whatâ€™s ahead in the distance. Finally, we annexed our driveway as garden space. When we bought the house, the narrow gravel driveway was long enough to park a row of six cars. So we cut it into three roughly equal sections, paving   with brick, for our two cars and paving another third with brick that has a planting bed of creeping thyme in the center, so two more cars can be parked, if need be, without hurting the thyme. The final section of the driveway is still gravel, blocked by a gate. And in the center, my kitchen garden, where the crops change seasonally. Herbs, strawberries and lettuce are growing this month. Four years later, the garden is not finished, but happily a garden never is. Some plants get too big and others fail to thrive. Landscaping is tricky. Half our rosemary hedges died, and if I had to do it over, I would not grout the patio but would lay the bluestone pavers in a permeable base of decomposed granite because thereâ€™s less rainwater runoff if it can percolate into the ground. But these days, I donâ€™t have to remind my husband why we bought this house. I often find him sitting contentedly and playing his guitar on the front porch, overlooking the meadow. He has not mentioned the cedar tree in weeks."

20910,Obama Signs Executive Order Declaring Investigation Into Election Results; Revote Planned For Dec. 19th - ABC News,Jimmy Rustling,"64 SHARE President Obama has signed an Executive Order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on December 19th. (AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â€” Following the results of Tuesday nightâ€™s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
â€œPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,â€ Obama told reporters. â€œMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.â€ 
Under the Presidentâ€™s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdayâ€™s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidentâ€™s decision. 
â€œCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnâ€™t allow that to happen. President Obama doesnâ€™t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.â€ 
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
â€œWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.â€ 
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
â€œMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their statesâ€™ electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.â€ 
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidentâ€™s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
â€œ[The electoral college] is a fâ€”king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and thatâ€™s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Itâ€™s time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.â€ 
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
â€œWeâ€™re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,â€ Obama said. â€œWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnâ€™t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?â€ Obama said. â€œIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.â€ 
If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administrationâ€™s special election hotline at (785) 273-0325. TAGS "
20911,Nate Terani: One Veteran's War on Islamophobia,Nick Turse,"  
Recently, I was asked a question about Kill Anything That Moves , my history of civilian suffering during the Vietnam War. An interviewer wanted to know how I responded to veterans who took offense at the (supposed) implication that every American who served in Vietnam committed atrocities. 
I think I softly snorted and slowly shook my head. 
Already two books behind me, Kill Anything That Moves might as well have been written by someone else in another lifetime. In some sense, it was. 
It takes effort for me to dredge up the faded memories of that work, a Kodachrome-hued swirl of hundreds of interviews on two continents over the course of a decade. But this particular question was easy enough to answer. Almost all the Americans I interviewed had seen combat, but most American veterans of the war hadnâ€™t. Many had little or no real opportunity to commit war crimes. Case closed. 
But that question caused me to recall a host of related queries that churned around the book. Questions by skeptics, atrocity-deniers, fair-minded interviewers attempting to play devilâ€™s advocate. A favorite was whether the book was â€œanti-veteran.â€ That, too, was a head-shaker for me. 
â€œHow could that be?â€ I would respond. After all, the book owed its genesis to veterans. Veterans were key sources for it. Veterans provided the evidence. Veterans provided the quotes. Veterans even supplied the title. The book was, to a great extent, the history of the war as described to me by veterans. The story I told was their story. How could that in any way be anti-veteran? 
Many of the vets I spoke with viewed their truth-telling as a form of patriotism, of continuing service to country. Nate Teraniâ€™s inaugural TomDispatch essay follows in the same American tradition. His eyes were opened to the abuse of military power while living in Iran as a boy. Later he would join the U.S. Navy and wear the stars and stripes with particular pride. September 11th and all that came after â€” notably the demonization of his Muslim faith in his homeland â€” imbued him with a new mission, one he now views as no less sacred than his military service. 
From Smedley Butler to Andrew Bacevich , Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning , Vietnam Veterans Against the War to Iraq Veterans Against the War , the U.S. armed forces have produced a steady stream of truth-tellers and whistleblowers, men and women willing to serve their country in profound ways during trying times. Thereâ€™s no bronze star for activism, no Navy Cross for unpopular or contrarian opinions, no Purple Heart for the hard knocks involved in speaking out against war crimes or Islamophobia or laying bare information vital to the American public. Veterans who dare to do so have sometimes walked a cold, lonely road far from the warm glow enjoyed by summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. Those who do so exhibit a special form of courage that may even exceed the bravery of the battlefield, the courage to stand tall and make oneself a target, a courage deserving ( with a nod to Thomas Paine ) of the love and thanks of man and woman."
20912,POLLAK: Adm. Mike Mullenâ€™s Partisan Attack on Steve Bannon - Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,"Admiral Mike Mullen served the United States with the greatest distinction, serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. [His attack in Mondayâ€™s New York Times on White House adviser (and former Breitbart News chair) Steve Bannon, however, does a disservice to the public policy debate about national security strategy.  Adm. Mullen objects to Bannonâ€™s appointment to the National Security Council (NSC). He admits, however, that President Bushâ€™s NSC â€œwas arranged similarly to Mr. Trumpâ€™s,â€ albeit with the exclusion of political guru Karl Rove. He also admits President Obama included his own political adviser, David Axelrod, in NSC meetings  â€”   even though Axelrod had no military or foreign policy experience whatsoever (and close ties to the   left and Chicagoâ€™s corrupt Democratic machine). In addition, Adm. Mullen complains about â€œMr. Bannonâ€™s troubling public positions. â€ Adm.  does not list which positions he means  â€”   hoping, perhaps, that the false innuendos of mainstream media attacks will fill in the blanks for the Timesâ€˜ readers. USA Today recently reviewed hundreds of hours of Bannonâ€™s radio commentaries and found none of the racism, antisemitism or â€œwhite nationalismâ€ that the Times, among others, falsely ascribed to him. All it found was that Bannon worried about the threats posed by Islam and China. Those are threats most Americans also take seriously  â€”   and which, presumably, Adm. Mullen did as well. Where Adm. Mullenâ€™s argument really begins to take on water is when he worries that Bannonâ€™s presence would disrupt what is supposed to be a â€œnonpartisanâ€ institution. It is hard to imagine a more partisan security apparatus than that which emerged on Adm. Mullenâ€™s watch, when the military undertook   changes such as the end of â€œDonâ€™t Ask, Donâ€™t Tell. â€ And though generals asked for more troops in Afghanistan, the president gave them less than they needed  â€”   along with a   timeline that ended, conveniently, in time Obamaâ€™s  . And the disastrous 2011 pullout from Iraq flew in the face of Adm. Mullenâ€™s own recommendation to Congress, in 2007, that success required a   commitment there. Bannonâ€™s official job title is not political adviser, but â€œChief Strategist. â€ That undoubtedly involves some political advice, but it also points to a role in maintaining the coherence of Trump administration policies. That is crucial in a White House led by a political outsider with a   mandate for change. Bannonâ€™s own naval experience, and his immersion in history and foreign policy, qualify him for the role. And speaking as his former colleague at Breitbart News, I can testify to his   in moments of crisis. I feel more secure knowing Steve is advising our president  â€”   and I believe others should, as well. In a â€œdisruptiveâ€ presidency, he is a stabilizing influence, as he was on the campaign trail. President Trump seems to agree. Adm. Mullen says he worries about â€œa blurring of presidential responsibilities  â€”   Republican Party leader and commander in chief. â€ But the Constitution recognizes no such distinction, and the time for worrying about that began in January 2009, when for the first time, the U. S. military was led by a    who placed his own political fortunes ahead of the safety and security of the American people. The morning after the Benghazi attacks in 2012, for example, President Obama flew to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser. None of his predecessors  â€”   not even President Jimmy Carter  â€”   would have done that. President Trump, like his predecessors, deserves to choose his team, and a leader of Adm. Mullenâ€™s stature should not lend his name to partisan and evidently misinformed attacks. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the â€œmost influentialâ€ people in news media in 2016. His new book, How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution, is available from Regnery.

20913,Ruth Bader Ginsburg Calls Colin Kaepernickâ€™s National Anthem Protest â€˜Dumbâ€™ - The New York Times,Christine Hauser,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who came under fire recently for lacerating comments about Donald J. Trump, has dropped another   remark about a different figure in the news: the N. F. L. football player Colin Kaepernick and his protest surrounding the national anthem. In an interview published on Monday by Yahoo News, Justice Ginsburg said that the San Francisco 49ers quarterbackâ€™s move to kneel and not stand during the anthem, as a protest against police brutality and racial oppression, was â€œdumb. â€ The gesture has been adapted by other professional athletes and has even spread to high school teams. When asked by the news siteâ€™s global anchor, Katie Couric, what she thought of the protest, Justice Ginsburg said: â€œI think itâ€™s really dumb of them. Would I arrest them for doing it? No. I think itâ€™s dumb and disrespectful. â€ â€œI would have the same answer if you asked me about  . I think itâ€™s a terrible thing to do,â€ she added. â€œBut I wouldnâ€™t lock a person up for doing it. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act. â€ â€œItâ€™s dangerous to arrest people for conduct that doesnâ€™t jeopardize the health or   of other people. It is a symbol they are engaged in,â€ she said. Asked whether she meant it was their right to protest, Justice Ginsburg agreed. â€œIf they want to be stupid, thereâ€™s no law that should be preventive,â€ Justice Ginsburg said. â€œIf they want to be arrogant, thereâ€™s no law that prevents them from that. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that. â€ Justice Ginsburgâ€™s indignant dissents in the court have made her a sort of heroine of the left. But the    jurist has also earned the nickname â€œNotorious R. B. Gâ€ for her outspoken comments off the bench. Shannon Sharpe, a former professional football player who is now a   on the show â€œUndisputedâ€ on Fox Sports, said, however, that while Justice Ginsburg had been a good champion for minority causes, she should be careful in expressing her opinions. â€œI would ask Justice Ginsburg that when you see a man crying, donâ€™t tell him to stop crying. Ask him, say, â€˜Sir why are you crying?â€™ â€ he said. Mr. Sharpe added, â€œWe are seeing far too many unarmed black men dying at the hands of police with no accountability taking place. â€ As of Tuesday, Mr. Kaepernick had not publicly reacted to Justice Ginsburgâ€™s remarks. But his protest came to light on Aug. 26, when the national anthem played before the start of a preseason game with the Green Bay Packers. He did not stand, later explaining that he had decided to remain seated as a statement against racial oppression. â€œI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,â€ he told N. F. L. Media. â€œTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,â€ he said. He drew swift backlash, with critics, including Mr. Trump, excoriating him for the protest. But the protest expanded, with more athletes joining him  â€”   at professional arenas and on high school sports field. President Obama said it was Mr. Kaepernickâ€™s constitutional right. On the athleteâ€™s Twitter feed, he has curated a timeline of events that have been part of the recent national discourse about race, politics and police behavior, including a protest by white supremacists in front of the N. A. A. C. P. headquarters in Houston, an article about how Arizona teenagers were forced by their school to change out of their Black Lives Matters shirts, and stories about fatal police shootings. â€œThere are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder,â€ Mr. Kaepernick has said. Mr. Kaepernick will be the starting quarterback against the Buffalo Bills at New Era Field this Sunday, the 49ers head coach Chip Kelly, said on Tuesday according to WKBW. Justice Ginsburgâ€™s remarks to Ms. Couric were the latest to draw some criticism beyond the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court. In July, she criticized Mr. Trump, at the time the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, saying: â€œI canâ€™t imagine what this place would be  â€”   I canâ€™t imagine what the country would be  â€”   with Donald Trump as our president. â€œFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be  â€”   I donâ€™t even want to contemplate that. â€ She later expressed regret. â€œJudges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office,â€ she wrote in a brief statement issued by the court, admitting her remarks were â€œill advised. â€ â€œIn the future I will be more circumspect,â€ she added in the statement. When Mr. Trump came up in the Yahoo interview  â€”   Ms. Couric asked for her thoughts on his remarks about banning Muslims from entering the United States  â€”   the justice declined to answer, saying there was a real possibility that the issue could land on her desk. â€œI canâ€™t answer a hypothetical question when it may turn into a real question,â€ Justice Ginsburg said. â€œI canâ€™t preview my decision. â€"
20914,Elizabeth Warren: â€˜We Need a Justice Department Not an Obstruction of Justice Departmentâ€™ - Breitbart,Penny Starr,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) used her time at the podium giving a commencement speech at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to slam the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding President Donaldâ€™s Trump decision to fire James Comey as FBI director and the Department of Justiceâ€™s effort to replace him.[  Warren asked the graduates to become activists for causes and named a few, including animal rescue,   care and â€œbullying. â€ Then she attacked her political opponents, saying, â€œI canâ€™t help myself. â€ â€œAnd I have one more: the principle that no one in this country is above the law  â€”   and we need a justice department not an obstruction of justice department,â€ Warren said. Warren also told the graduates that big corporations and the wealthy are trying to â€œfundamentally changeâ€ the country and it is up to them to stop it. â€œYour elected officials are increasingly working only for the few  â€”   the very wealthy few,â€ Warren said. â€œAnd they are setting policies only to benefit the few  â€”   the very wealthy few. And if that doesnâ€™t change then this country will fundamentally change. â€œIt is your world, your future that is on the line,â€ Warren said. Warren also made several references to drinking alcohol during her speech, including mentioning a drinking game named for her, during her   speech. â€œI understand that every extra minute I speak is that much longer before you can hit the bars,â€ Warren said. Fortune magazine previewed Warrenâ€™s speech by noting that she was on TIME magazineâ€™s list of the 100 most influential people in the world this year and included the statement by the universityâ€™s Chancellor Kumble R. Subbaswamy, who called the senator â€œa strong role model for students. â€ â€œWe are inspired by her staunch advocacy for equitable access to education, environmental resource conservation and support for economic justice,â€ Subbaswamy said in a statement. â€œThese issues are in alignment with our campusâ€™s core values and our long history of activism in pursuit of social justice. â€ â€œAt UMass Amherst we stand for the hopes, the ambitions, the bold experiments and the innovative solutions of the people of Massachusetts and the world beyond,â€ Subbaswamy said. â€œWe share Sen. Warrenâ€™s commitment to making a profound, transformative contribution to the common good. â€"
20915,"White House Calls for Deep Cuts to Taxes on Families, Individuals, and Businesses - Breitbart",John Carney,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed deep changes to federal taxes, including sharp cuts in both individual and business taxes and the elimination of the estate tax. [The proposal reduces the number of individual income tax brackets to three â€”  10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. It would double the standard deduction, effectively eliminating federal income taxes on the first $24, 000 of a coupleâ€™s income. It also calls for the elimination of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. The White House also said that families would receive a break for child care expenses.  As a result of these changes, the tax burden on most Americans would be reduced under the plan. The Trump administration would eliminate most itemized tax deductions except for the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations. Notably, taxpayers would not be able to deduct state and local taxes, which hurts residents of   states such as New York and California. Lower tax rates, however, make these deductions less valuable. The corporate tax rate would fall to 15 percent from 35 percent. In addition, U. S. companies would owe little or no tax on future profits earned outside the U. S. putting the U. S. on a territorial tax system similar to those employed in most developed countries. Business income reported on individual returns would also drop to 15 percent, a change that would benefit many small businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economics adviser Gary Cohn set forth the framework at a White House press conference on Wednesday. The proposals bear a strong resemblance to those set forth by the Trump campaign last year. Many details will still have to be worked out and negotiated with Congress. The proposal did not go into specifics about the child care credit, for example. Nor did it spell out how stockpiled foreign earnings of U. S. companies would be treated if repatriated."
20916,Netflix Goes Global and Its Profit Soars - The New York Times,Emily Steel,"A year ago, Netflix boldly declared that it planned to conquer the global market for streaming television, adding more than 130 countries to its service map. It also promised to start delivering material profits in 2017 after operating at   profitability for several quarters. On Wednesday, the company released business results showing that it is on its way to reaching those targets, even as competition accelerates from services like Amazon and Hulu. Netflix added a record 7. 05 million streaming members in the three months that ended Dec. 31, up from the 5. 59 million net additions in the same period of 2015. That growth, in domestic and international markets, beat its forecast of 5. 2 million new members for the quarter. Netflix now has a total of 93. 8 million members. Fueling the increase in subscribers was a rapid rise in Netflix memberships abroad. The company said it is learning â€œhow best to match content with audiences tastes around the world. â€ It added 5. 1 million international members in the quarter, and now has 44. 4 million members outside the United States, more than than 47 percent of its total membership. Netflix cited its original series â€œMarvelâ€™s Luke Cageâ€ and â€œThe Crownâ€ as worldwide hits. It said it planned to invest more than $6 billion in content this year, up from $5 billion in 2016. Profits are rising steadily. Net income increased 56 percent to $67 million in the quarter from the same period in 2015. The company projected that profits would reach $165 million in the current quarter, up from $28 million in the period a year ago. â€œWe donâ€™t really believe in   businesses, like suddenly we will turn significantly profitable at 200 million members,â€ Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said during a conference call. â€œWe think it is much smarter to grow into that bit by bit. â€ Competition in streaming television is becoming more fierce and remains a big challenge for Netflix. The company, a pioneer in the market, listed a number of competitors that are encroaching on its turf, including Amazon, which recently announced a global expansion, and YouTube, which leads online video viewing time worldwide. Meanwhile, satellite television companies and traditional television outlets are pouring more resources into streaming offerings. â€œIn short, itâ€™s becoming an internet TV world, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Netflix as we strive to earn screen time,â€ Netflix said in a letter to shareholders. Netflixâ€™s stock price is typically volatile on days when the company reports earnings, and Wednesday was no exception. The earnings report sent shares up about 8 percent in   trading. Netflix shares rose about 8 percent for all of 2016, after having surged 135 percent for 2015, as the top performer on the Standard  Poorâ€™s   index. The company predicted that subscriptions would continue to grow in the current quarter, although slower than in the period last year. It forecast that it would add 5. 2 million members, 1. 5 million of them in the United States and 3. 7 million abroad. It attributed the slowdown to tough comparisons from the same period last year, particularly with the introduction of the service in 130 countries last January. The quarter was the 10th anniversary of Netflixâ€™s streaming service, which began with the vision that internet television would ultimately replace traditional television. But even as Netflix reported its biggest net addition of streaming members in its history, Mr. Hastings was not satisfied standing still. Asked about his ultimate vision for the company during the conference call, he said, â€œYou never want to characterize something as an ultimate vision, because when you get there, there is always more you want to do. â€ â€œThink of us as just continuing to iterate on the basic cycle of more content and better product, that combines at a great service at a great price,â€ he said. â€œHopefully, with that we can attract many more people to join Netflix, and then that fuels the whole cycle. So we are just going to lather, rinse, repeat again and again for the next couple of years. â€"
20917,"After Terrorizing America with Zika Scaremongering, Washington Post Now Admits Zika Virus Doesnâ€™t Cause Brain Deformities After All",NaturalNews Network,"
by The Health Ranger Mike Adams
The entire leftist media is not merely dishonest and corrupt, their science writers are unbelievably stupid and ill-informed about nearly everything in the natural world. Today, after months of printing fear-inducing â€œZika terrorismâ€ stories that scared America half to death while convincing the government to funnel billions of dollars into Zika vaccine research for Big Pharma, the Washington Post now admits it had no idea what it was talking about .
But rather than admitting its own science writers were scientifically illiterate propagandists pushing quack narratives as news, the paper now blames other scientists for the gross error by publishing a headline thatâ€™s once again dishonest and deceptive: â€œScientists are bewildered by Zikaâ€™s path across Latin America,â€ it proclaims.
Bewildered about â€œZikaâ€™s path?â€ The story headline should actually read, â€œZika HOAX revealedâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t cause brain damage after all.â€ (Read it at this link .)
Washington Post has been shamelessly pushing the Zika HOAX for monthsâ€¦ with no apology to readers 
In the story, writers Dom Phillips and Nick Miroff essentially reveal that what the Washington Post has been writing about the Zika virus has been based entirely in government propaganda and pandemic lies pushed by the CDC, which of course has close ties to the criminal vaccine industry:
Nearly nine months after Zika was declared a global health emergency, the virus has infected at least 650,000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including tens of thousands of expectant mothers. 
But to the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil.
Yes, the Washington Post now says the scientists are â€œbewilderedâ€ that their apocalyptic scare stories that caused female athletes to skip out on the Rio Olympics and scared tens of millions of Americans into poisoning themselves with DEET (a neurotoxic chemical) turned out to be total hogwash. DEET, by the way, combines with carbamate class pesticides to cause neurological dysfunction in humans , which coincidentally increases the number of people who watch CNN or read the Washington Post.
For the record, no one who reads Natural News is surprised by this revelations that has left mainstream scientists â€œbewildered.â€ Itâ€™s not bewildering to me. I called Zika a total hoax from day one, pointing out that the brain deformities were caused by larvacide chemicals dumped into the water supply , not by Zika. See some of my stories that clearly spelled all this out months before the Washington Post had any clue what they were writing about:
February 11, 2016: Zika HOAX exposed by South American doctors: Brain deformations caused by larvicide chemical linked to Monsanto; GM mosquitoes a â€˜total failureâ€™ 
June 3, 2016: 10 shocking reasons why Zika virus fear is another fraudulent medical hoax and vaccine industry funding scam 
August 4, 2016: ZIKA DOOMSDAY HOAX UNRAVELS: Predicted â€˜explosionâ€™ of brain defects didnâ€™t happenâ€¦ entire scare campaign was manufactured 
August 29, 2016: Zika propaganda is a â€˜virus of the mindâ€™ rooted in fabricated hysteria, government junk science and dark political agendas 
March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY! Obama wants to funnel $1.8 billion for vaccine research and more 
I even published a mini-documentary revealing the published science that shows how DEET insecticide causes brain damage in humans. You can watch it at this link or view the video below:

If anyone from the Washington Post bothered to read Natural News and learn about real science, they would have learned that Zika has infected tens of millions of people throughout South America for decades , with absolutely no measurable increase in neurological deformations. (But facts be damned, the WashPost had a panic to push!)
Nation after nation records tens of thousands of infections with ZERO birth defectsâ€¦ 
Despite the factual reality of the situation, the state-controlled propagandists writing for rags like the Washington Post â€” a bogus newspaper that has lost all credibility in the minds of intelligent people â€” continued to pummel home their kooky science theories that claimed much of the U.S. South would be overrun by brain damaging mosquitoes, turning Southerners into shrunken-brained mutants while pregnant women fled northward to survive the airborne insect onslaught.
Instead, nothing happened . No explosion in shrunken-headed babies. No wave of birth defects across Florida, even as city officials desperately bombarded their own cities with brain-damaging insecticides. No national emergency declared by Obama to bring back DDT and eradicate baby-murdering mosquitoes by dousing our open streets with thick clouds of organophosphate neurotoxins.
Instead, the rate of neurological birth defects in most countries approached zero. Via the Washington Postâ€™s own graphic: (partial list)
Venezuela: 60,791 Zika infectionsâ€¦ ZERO birth defects
Honduras: 31,933 Zika infectionsâ€¦ ONE birth defect
Guadalupe: 30,969 Zika infectionsâ€¦ ZERO birth defects
Puerto Rico: 29,084 Zika infectionsâ€¦ TWO birth defects
Mexico: 4,837 Zika infectionsâ€¦ ZERO birth defects
From the WashPost article:
Brazilian officials were bracing for a flood of fetal deformities as Zika spread this year to other regions of the country, Marinho said. However, â€œwe are not seeing a big increase.â€
Gee, really?
The vast majority of the brain defects, it turns out, came from just one small region of Brazil. A total of 2,033 children are so far recorded with neurological defects there, even while most other countries throughout the region had ZERO birth defects (or near zero).
So what gives?
Zika mosquitoes apparently carry geopolitical maps so they can solely target Brazil 
You donâ€™t have to be a genius to figure out that the stupid science theories of the mainstream media are total hokum and bunk . If Zika really did cause brain defects, it would have spread all across South America by now. It would have spread into Florida, California, Mississippi and Louisiana. It would have devastated the American South, Cuba, Haiti, Curacao and all the other island nations across the Caribbean.
Yet the neurological defects were limited almost exclusively to Brazil.
Somehow, if we believe the illiterate Washington Post science writers â€” who may in fact be the only brain damage victims of Zika in North America â€” mosquitoes carry MAPS to make sure they only activate their brain damage voodoo in Brazil .
â€œâ€¦[A]lthough the outbreak has spread this year to more than 50 nations and territories across the Western Hemisphere, U.N. data shows just 142 cases of congenital birth defects linked to Zika so far outside Brazil,â€ says WashPost.
Yes, my friends: GPA-carrying Zika mosquitoes are very careful to limit their pandemic voodoo to just one region of Brazil. By sheer coincidence, thatâ€™s the same region where larvacide chemicals were dumped into the public water supply.
Apparently, there isnâ€™t a single â€œofficialâ€ scientist in the entire global government who has thought to test the water. Just freaking WOWâ€¦ Letâ€™s throw these morons out of power in every election, okay? They donâ€™t deserve any positions of authority over anyone else. Theyâ€™re all so incredibly stupid, they couldnâ€™t survive at all unless they functioned as parasites on the taxpayers.
They arenâ€™t giving up hope just yetâ€¦ science writers desperately hope for more brain damaged babies to prove them right 
Enthusiasm for more brain damaged babies runs high at the Washington Post, which explains why they are all in for Hillary Clinton, the candidate of choice for brain damaged adults . Writing with a sense of real enthusiasm, the Washington Post canâ€™t wait for more brain damaged babies to appear:
Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 26,800 cases of Zika. More than 7,000 pregnant women could be infected by the end of the year, according to the CDC. (Yippee?)
And now, the loony tunes quack science of the Zika â€œscientistsâ€ goes apoplectic, grasping for silly metaphors to try to obscure the fact that they are all stupid beyond belief . Via the WashPost:
â€œNow weâ€™ve settled on Zika as the smoking gun, but we donâ€™t know who pulled the trigger,â€ said Marques, speaking from Recife, where he is working with government researchers.
Huh? Wha? The metaphor doesnâ€™t even make any sense.
Maybe the problem is too much fornicating. Seriously, this is now part of their idiotic theory:
â€œSexual habits and hygiene may also play a role,â€ he said, explaining that researchers are looking at whether sexual transmission can infect the uterus and placenta with the virus, potentially exposing the fetus to elevated risk. â€œWe suspect the villain has an accomplice, but we donâ€™t know who it is,â€ Marques said.
Huh? Do they seriously think that people only have sex in Brazil but not other South American countries? Where does the Washington Post find these morons?
Iâ€™m a real scientist saying all this 
As you read all this, remember that I have rapidly become one of the worldâ€™s leading research scientists on the quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts using mass spec instrumentation. I led the team that developed the most pioneering (and accurate) CBD mass spec analysis method in existence today. You can read about it at this link . I also routinely test water, food and environmental samples for heavy metals, pesticides and a multitude of chemical contaminants. When I say these Zika scientists are complete morons, thatâ€™s the educated opinion of an accomplished scientist correctly pointing out the lunacy of Zika scaremongering.
I could have solved this entire problem in the first few days by analyzing and detecting brain-damaging larvacide chemicals in the public water supply in Eastern Brazil. The entire project would have taken just a few days and cost almost nothing. Instead, Obama handed $1.8 billion to the vaccine companies in the midst of the Zika panic pushed by laughable rags like the Washington Post. Itâ€™s all a racket, of course, just like their coverage of elections and political candidates. Everything you read at the Washington Post is a deception of one kind or another . The paper exists solely to promote the propaganda of the state so that the population can be manipulated and controlled.
The Washington Post exists to terrorize the citizens with fascist propaganda parading as science 
As youâ€™ve also learned by now, the corrupt leftist establishment of junk science, criminal politicians and idiotic journalists isnâ€™t interested in legitimate scientific solutions . They all function as extensions of a fascist state that must routinely terrorize its citizens with pandemic boogeyman scare stories in order to demand absolute obedience to the vaccine mandates that actually do damage the brains of children.
Thus, SCIENCE be damned. Theyâ€™ve got an agenda to push, and it doesnâ€™t matter to them whether that agenda is based on a single shred of real science. Zika is dangerous because they told you so, in exactly the same way they told you Hillary Clinton is totally honest, Obamacare would make health care more affordable, thereâ€™s no such thing as voter fraud in America, and GMOs and vaccines are really, really good for you.
So you can put down the DEET and stop poisoning your skin like an obedient idiot. Yes, it was all a scam. Yes, the official â€œscienceâ€ was totally rigged. Yes, the media lied to you yet again. Yes, the CDC is a criminal racket. Yes, all the health â€œofficialsâ€ were completely full of s**t. And no, Zika is not going to cause your babies to be born with shrunken heads. VACCINES, on the other hand, will most definitely cause brain damage, as they still contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin the Washington Post ridiculously insists becomes magically neutralized when you inject it into the body of a child.

20918,Charles Koch Makes Massive Donation to Historically Black Colleges - Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,"Billionaire Charles Koch, who is a frequent conservative political donor, has made a massive contribution to historically black colleges across the United States. [Through the Koch Foundation, Charles Koch donated $25. 6 million to historically black colleges for the purpose of conducting research on criminal justice and entrepreneurship in cities plagued by high crime.  â€œEducation transformed my life, and Iâ€™ve committed to do all I can to give others that same opportunity,â€ Koch said in a statement Wednesday evening. The Marshall fund has made that same commitment, he said, â€œgiving students and scholars the chance to discover new ways to overcome barriers holding too many people back. As they succeed, so does our society. â€ The donation was made to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, which benefits students at 47 universities including Howard University, the University of the District of Columbia, Bowie State, and Morgan State, all of which are historically black institutions. Liberals in academia are concerned about Koch money flowing to their universities. Ralph Wilson of Tallahassee,   of a group called UnKoch My Campus, claims that these donations were made so that the Koch brothers can have more control over curriculum and activism at the receiving institutions. â€œWhen they give the donor control, the   is academic freedom,â€ Wilson argued. Despite these claims, Brian Hooks, the president of the Koch foundation, maintains that the donations are not political in nature. â€œOur commitment across the board with all of our grants  â€¦     is to open inquiry,â€ Hooks said in an interview Tuesday. â€œWeâ€™re looking to support great  scholars. â€ Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about social justice and libertarian issues for Breitbart News.

20920,Democratic Congressman Threatens Violence If GOP Tries To Defund Planned Parenthood | Daily Wire,nan,"Democratic Congressman Threatens Violence If GOP Tries To Defund Planned Parenthood By: Hank Berrien November 21, 2016 
The Democratic congressman who is challenging House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, threatened a â€œYoungstown street fightâ€ if Donald Trump attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. 
Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNNâ€™s State of the Union on Sunday, Ryan intimated that defunding Planned Parenthood wasnâ€™t the only stimulus he would need to launch violence. He stated, â€œIf he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we are going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol.â€ 
Youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past; last May and August violence erupted on the streets of the city. 
Ryan called Trumpâ€™s infrastructure plan â€œa bunch of smoke and mirrors.â€ He added that he didnâ€™t blame Pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues: â€œI canâ€™t in good conscience hang this election around Nancy Pelosiâ€™s neck, of course. But, moving forward, we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for Donald Trump, even in my district, where they voted for me and they voted for Donald Trump.â€ 
Ryanâ€™s campaign to replace Pelsoi is picking up steam; on Sunday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice endorsed him, stating, ""He has a lot of good ideas, but maybe most importantly, he also isnâ€™t suggesting he has all the answers â€” he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing, that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy,"" Rice said in a statement.

20921,Marine Le Pen Hails â€™Extremely Positiveâ€™ Dutch Elections,Chris Tomlinson,"Despite Dutch   migration politician Geert Wilders coming second in the Dutch national elections this week, French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen called the result â€œextremely positiveâ€. [Earlier this week, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) under the leadership of   politician Geert Wilders came second in the national elections. Many in politics including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the media claimed Wilders coming second means the end of the populist movement sweeping Europe.  French   migration presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has firmly disagreed, Tiroler Tageszeitung reports. Ms. Le Pen called the result which saw the PVV increase its seats in the parliament â€œextremely positiveâ€. The vote also led to the total collapse of the Dutch Labour party which went from 25 per cent of the vote in 2012 to only 6 per cent, losing the majority of its seats in the parliament. â€œI would have been disappointed if he had slipped or stagnated, but he has risen and the parties in power have fallen heavily,â€ Le Pen noted. Le Pen, who leads the French Front National, is also an MEP and a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group along with the PVV and several other populist parties across Europe. â€œFor Wilders this is extremely positive, which is the proof of the reach of our joint ideas in the different European countries,â€ she added. In six weeks, Marine Le Pen will head to her own election fight as the first round of the French presidential elections approaches. Le Pen has maintained a steady lead in polling for weeks for the first round and is currently at around 28 per cent according to polls released Friday.

The Front National leader is expected to face Emmanuel Macron in the second round in May as conservative Republican candidate FranÃ§ois Fillon has been tarred by financial scandals involving fake jobs for his family members. Initially, Macron was seen as easily defeating Le Pen as early    polls gave him a substantial lead. Since then, Le Pen has been closing the gap between her and Macron with latest polling showing that the difference is approaching single digits.

20922,Vox Editor: 'I Have Written There's 0 Evidence The Clinton Foundation Was Used For Personal Family Enrichment. Looks Like I Was Wrong' | RedFlag News,Redflag Newsdesk,"
Jeff Stein | VOX 
Hillary Clinton found herself in a no-win dilemma as she moved to launch her presidential run while also aiding her husbandâ€™s globe-trotting philanthropy â€” and her team knew it. 
Sometime before announcing her candidacy, Clinton had agreed to go to a Clinton Global Initiative fundraiser in Morocco planned for May 2015. The king of Morocco had personally pledged to give $12 million with the understanding sheâ€™d attend, according to emails released last week by WikiLeaks. 
But then there was the awkward fact that Clinton would be running for president by then. That set up a bind: Go to the event, and Clinton would be appearing to indulge a foreign government known for egregious human right abuses to help her familyâ€™s private charity. Pull out, and Clinton would be going back on her word to the Moroccan king. 
â€œThe King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting. It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months,â€ Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote in an email in November 2014, several months before Clinton declared her candidacy. â€œShe created this mess.â€ 
Hillary Clinton ultimately decided against attending, and Chelsea Clinton and Bill Clinton went instead. (Politico has reported a Moroccan phosphate export firm gave â€œat leastâ€ $1 million, but itâ€™s not clear if the other $11 million came through. The foundation doesnâ€™t have to disclose the gift and has declined to confirm one way or another to reporters.) 
But since this story broke late last week, Clinton has been getting attacked for it far and wide. And this time itâ€™s not just Donald Trump and Fox News: Even mainstream outlets like the Atlantic and the Associated Press have published tough pieces about the controversy. (The Huffington Post said it amounted to a â€œbrutal, clean hitâ€ on the Democratic nominee.) 
This controversy has stoked wildly misleading allegations implying that Clinton is corrupt, even in some leading news outlets. But while those claims are overblown, the story still illustrates how the foundation helped put wealthy donors into Clintonâ€™s orbit â€” and allowed them to buy a rare chance to shape her perspective that few average Americans will ever get.

20923,Hamas Sentences Two Palestinians to Death for Drug Smuggling,Breitbart Jerusalem,"GAZA CITY (PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES) (AFP)  â€”    A Hamas military court on Sunday sentenced two Palestinians to death for drug smuggling in the Gaza Strip, in the first punishment of its kind in the enclave. [â€œThe Gaza military court announced the death penalty for two civilians from Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, for selling narcotics,â€ the   interior ministry said in a statement.  It said a third suspect was sentenced to hard labour. Authorities have seized drugs with a street value of around $1 million (900, 000 euros) over the past few months, the ministry said. They seized 1, 250 packets of cannabis and 400 pills of Tramadol  â€”   a powerful   painkiller  â€”   in January alone, it said. Until Sunday, only people guilty of spying for Israel or murder had received the death penalty in Gaza, controlled by Islamist Hamas since 2007. All Palestinian death sentences in theory have to be approved by president Mahmoud Abbas, but Hamas has long refused to accept his legitimacy. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) said Sundayâ€™s sentences were a â€œserious precedentâ€ and that bringing civilians before a military court was a breach of Palestinian law. It said that one of the two men was condemned to death by hanging and the other was to hang. The PCHR said in an   statement that to carry out the sentences would be â€œ  killing, and those (who) participated or contributed to issuing them should be held accountable on grounds of   killing and abuse of powerâ€. â€œApplying this penalty in drugs cases is very dangerous, particularly in absence of fair trial guarantees and presence of many reports exposing widespread use of torture during the interrogation period, especially in drugs crimes,â€ it added. The centre said that around a dozen death sentences have been passed down in Gaza since the start of 2017."

The president made his remarks during the unveiling of a memorial which featured the Berlin Wall and a section of one of the Twin Towers that were destroyed by terrorists on  . Trump admitted that his call was â€œvery, very direct,â€ but essential for keeping the alliance together. â€œWe have to make up for the many years lost,â€ Trump said. â€œTwo percent is the bare minimum for confronting todayâ€™s very real and very vicious threats. â€ He also alluded to the cost of the new NATO headquarters building, suggesting that it was another expense shouldered by the American taxpayer. â€œI never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost, I refuse to do that, but it is beautiful,â€ he said."
20926,Anthony Weinerâ€™s Alleged Teenaged Sexting Victim Pens SCATHING Open Letter To FBI Director Comey,Allison Vincent,"Anthony Weinerâ€™s Alleged Teenaged Sexting Victim Pens SCATHING Open Letter To FBI Director Comey 786 Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
With just a little over a week to go before election day, FBI Director James Comey took it upon himself to blatantly interfere with the process. 
During a probe into Anthony Weinerâ€™s sexting scandal, the FBI supposedly uncovered emails that may or may not (probably not) have something to do with Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server, for which she has already been exonerated. Comey sent a vague letter to congress which he KNEW would start a shit-storm in the media, and now the race is closer than ever. And here Trump complains about a â€œriggedâ€ election! 
Unfortunately, while attempting to sway voters, Comey didnâ€™t consider that there was someone else at the center of this â€” Anthony Weinerâ€™s victim, who is only 16 years old. 
She was understandably upset and had a few words to say to the FBI director. You can read the entire letter on BuzzFeed , but here are a few excerpts: 
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. 
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didnâ€™t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. 
â€¦ 
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reportersâ€™ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. 
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my â€œstoryâ€ the goal of every reporter? 
She signs the letter with, â€œGirl that lost faith in America.â€ 
And that coming from a girl who is barely starting her life, but who is also approaching voting age is heartbreaking.

20928,Hillary Clinton has a deep commitment.,nan,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - 
Hillary Clinton is very sincere and is committed to economy, employment, refugees, immigration and health reforms as a means of making lasting change in the US and in the world. Now we need to take concrete action and not waste time in rhetoric. Hillary Clinton is committed to build an infrastructure of education, employment, health care, small business, free press, electrical power, communications and transportation. Hillary Clinton has a deep commitment. She is active in our educational and development community, include her involvement with the government and with leaders. She played an important role in offering outreach to the people including women and children. We must vote for her. We should remember that the first condition for economic reforms is good leaders, and employment. Good leaders and employment opportunities are necessary not only for the economic growth but also for the security, physical well being and psychological comfort of the American citizens. US has always been demonstrated a decent and sustained growth rate because of a fully functioning democratic system. The pillars of the US democratic system include regular elections, peaceful transfer of power, American people's involvement in all development programs, and a reliable power among the states. This has enabled US to pursue a policy of economic liberalization, massive educational improvement and of providing a solid investment in a long-term perspective. Yes, US still suffers from unemployment, and faces challenges; these problems seem solvable soon. US needs to establish and implement long-term policies of economic growth. It should also create a well-organized and comprehensive development vision that all the political leaders should agree to follow. Making appropriate investments in our roads, electrification, and extension services would help considerably in improving Americans lives. Increasing investment in basic education and health care are important in ensuring that the poor participate meaningfully in the economic growth. A lack of education and health care hurts the poor today. And finally, President Hillary Clinton must focus on generating high rates of sustainable growth while ensuring that the benefits of that growth is spread to all parts of states. As we know, the solutions are the same everywhere, have a society based on equity and justice for everyone. - Advertisement - As we know, most countries do the opposite. Discrimination against women and children today is as bad as decades ago. It's always the issue of the privileged not caring, the poor get hurt and people of color and women especially get hurt the most. Thus, vote for Hillary Clinton, because the role of the leaders is more important and they can assist people's movements for economic growth. - Advertisement -"
20929,Visiting McDonaldâ€™s With My Grandmother - The New York Times,Christine Ro,"As a kid, I was in awe of my grandmotherâ€™s ability to stretch a dollar when it came to food. She always knew the price differentials at the local Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern and white American markets. And she strategized for trips to McDonaldâ€™s. For instance, she realized that the two of us  â€”   a child and a senior, both petite females  â€”   added up to one   appetite, so ordering a Big Breakfast to share made better sense than ordering separate, smaller meals. We shared quite a few of these over the years. There was a McDonaldâ€™s on the way to my elementary school, where she would walk me some mornings. Sheâ€™d sit with her coffee (the best in America, she always said) and me with my juice. And weâ€™d attack the Big Breakfast from either side. The eggs in one corner, the sausage in another, and the biscuit, hash brown and condiments all in their own place: Itâ€™s not surprising that the compartmentalization of the different food items should have appealed to her sense of food order. She was Korean, and the assortment of separate little dishes known as banchan is central to Korean food. Grandma had moved to the United States from her native South Korea in midlife, to be closer to her two daughters in Southern California. She needed to figure out both a new language and a new social landscape. These were more complicated than sheâ€™d anticipated, because she ended up living in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood. So the move wasnâ€™t just about adapting to a majority white and majority   culture. She needed the basics of both English and Spanish, for one thing. She might have been disoriented by racial distinctions, but class differences she understood. Sheâ€™d been married to a     man when she was young, and over the decades of their marriage had gotten used to an ascending level of luxury: cars, servants, status. Wealth insulated her from certain kinds of discomfort but didnâ€™t guard against her husbandâ€™s steady stream of infidelities. It bought her luxuries like breast implants, at a time when this was a bizarre purchase for a   Korean woman. I was almost morbidly fascinated by those implants later on. I knew her as an old woman, and there was a sharp contrast between the rocks on her chest and the softness and slackness of the rest of her body. When she moved to the United States   she suddenly had to work for a living. As she had no practical skills, she found work deboning chickens by hand. She tore apart chickens during the day, and went to her cramped apartment at night. And yet, improbably, she was happy. She smoked with abandon. She ate whatever she wanted. She had female friends at the factory, as well as male Korean friends she gathered with to play the Korean card game hwatu. Gambling with men would have been unthinkable in her previous life. Sheâ€™d traded opulence for independence, and she was better off. But her earnings put her under the poverty line, making her eligible for   housing. While her daughters helped her out where they could, she had to scrimp. Her bedroom became a kind of monument to her earlier life, packed with artworks, jewelry and expensive clothing  â€”   things to gradually sell off. It is astonishing that my grandmother had any appetite for fast food after working on a chicken disassembly line. She may have had a greater appreciation for   food after spending her days among its raw ingredients. Or maybe itâ€™s telling that she generally avoided chicken at McDonaldâ€™s. Grandma kept a mental calendar of McDonaldâ€™s promotions. When hamburgers were on sale for 29 cents each, she bought 10 at a time and kept a supply in the freezer. As a treat, she sometimes splurged on the   cheeseburger. My grandmother also looked forward to each McDonaldâ€™s Monopoly period, that marvel of synergistic marketing that turned every McDonaldâ€™s purchase into a   prize opportunity. This allowed her to scratch the gambling itch in a socially accepted way. For a brief period I, along with every other person I knew, went temporarily deranged over going to McDonaldâ€™s as frequently as our wallets and waistbands would allow. I donâ€™t know how much money eating at McDonaldâ€™s actually saved. Arguably it could have been cheaper to cook at home, but my grandmother never really learned to cook. Sheâ€™d never had to in Korea, what with the professional cooks in her house. Cooking American food, especially, would have been daunting. My grandmother loved McDonaldâ€™s in a way that only someone who hadnâ€™t grown up with it could. So after she died, as my family was preparing for the Korean grave site ritual of bringing food loved by the deceased, I thought about collecting a burger, fries and Americaâ€™s best coffee. I was overruled, so we ended up leaving Korean takeaway noodles  â€”   jjamppong  â€”   on her grave instead. The broth leaked out of the package, leaving a fishy smell and a mess on our hands. My grandmother is buried in the notoriously    Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, Calif. which strives for   grandeur in its massive statues and chapels that are reproductions of the European originals. The grave sites become more elaborate and expensive the higher you go up the hill, suggesting that in Los Angeles, inequality persists even after death. But Grandma was proud of the spot sheâ€™d secured midway up. For decades, sheâ€™d saved money for her own grave and two others, for other women in the family to use eventually. Status after death somehow mattered to her, even though sheâ€™d given up on it in life. As I placed the leaky package of noodles on her grave, I wondered, in my very unspiritual way, what would happen to the food. It would be wasted, I imagined. That seemed inappropriate for my grandmother, who held on to frozen fast food for years, and didnâ€™t throw anything away. Iâ€™ve stepped inside a McDonaldâ€™s only a few times since Grandma died, and it just isnâ€™t the same. It will never be as special to me as it was to her, as a shining symbol of American culture. But its ubiquity is strangely comforting. Seeing this chain restaurant everywhere is a bit like seeing her everywhere. You donâ€™t need a fancy grave site to honor a relative, after all. A chain restaurant that triggers a flood of memories can be enough."
20930,(VIDEO) Female College Students Protesting Because â€˜Trump is a Rapistâ€™,nan,"
21st Century Wire saysâ€¦ 
US college students continue to be emotionally traumatized and â€˜threatenedâ€™ by Donald Trumpâ€™s surprise presidential victory this week, sparking a wave of nationally coordinated street protests, organized in part through the George Soros funded Democratic Party â€˜community organizingâ€™ web portal MoveOn.org . 
Various protests and riots have been organized around a number university campuses including Berkeley, Portland, New York City and Los Angleses. 
When asked why she scared by the election result, one female university student claimed that the President Elect is a â€œrapist,â€ while another claim that, â€œHe [Trump] is about to have a court case about a 13 years old girl soon, and Iâ€™m not down for that.â€ 
The alleged court case the student is referring was actually dropped , and has since been exposed as a likely politically motivated hoax according to reports . 
Here is last nightâ€™s student protest, including multiple interviews from both sides of the debate, filmed last night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, by Stuart J Hooper . Watch:

20931,"In New Jersey Student Loan Program, Even Death May Not Bring a Reprieve - The New York Times",Annie Waldman,"Amid a haze of grief after her sonâ€™s unsolved murder last year, Marcia   faced an endless list of tasks  â€”   helping the police gain access to Kevinâ€™s phone and email canceling his subscriptions, credit cards and bank accounts and arranging his burial in New Jersey. And then there were the college loans. When Ms.   called about his federal loans, an administrator offered condolences and assured her the balance would be written off. But she got a far different response from a New Jersey state agency that had also lent her son money. â€œPlease accept our condolences on your loss,â€ a letter from that agency, the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, said. â€œAfter careful consideration of the information you provided, the authority has determined that your request does not meet the threshold for loan forgiveness. Monthly bill statements will continue to be sent to you. â€ Ms.   who   on the loans, was shocked and confused. But her experience with the authority, which runs by far the largest   student loan program in the country, is hardly an isolated one, an investigation by ProPublica, in collaboration with The New York Times, found. New Jerseyâ€™s loans, which currently total $1. 9 billion, are unlike those of any other government lending program for students in the country. They come with extraordinarily stringent rules that can easily lead to financial ruin. Repayments cannot be adjusted based on income, and borrowers who are unemployed or facing other financial hardships are given few breaks. The loans also carry higher interest rates than similar federal programs. Most significant, New Jerseyâ€™s loans come with a cudgel that even the most predatory   players cannot wield: the power of the state. New Jersey can garnish wages, rescind state income tax refunds, revoke professional licenses, even take away lottery winnings  â€”   all without having to get court approval. â€œItâ€™s   â€ Daniel Frischberg, a bankruptcy lawyer, said. â€œThe New Jersey program is set up so that you fail. â€ The authority, which boasts in brochures that its â€œsingular focus has always been to benefit the students we serve,â€ has become even more aggressive in recent years. Interviews with dozens of borrowers, who were among the tens of thousands who have turned to the program, show how the loans have unraveled lives. The programâ€™s regulations have destroyed familiesâ€™ credit and forced them to forfeit their salaries. One college graduate declared bankruptcy at age 26 after struggling to repay his debt. The agency filed four simultaneous lawsuits against a    paralegal after she fell behind on her payments. Another borrower, Chris Gonzalez, could not keep up with his loans after he got  â€™s lymphoma and was laid off by Goldman Sachs. While the federal government allowed him to suspend his payments because of hardship, New Jersey sued him, seeking $266, 000 in payments, and seized a state tax refund he was owed. One reason for the aggressive tactics is that the state depends on Wall Street investors to finance student loans through   bonds and needs to satisfy those investors by keeping losses to a minimum. Loan revenues also cover about half of the agencyâ€™s administrative budget. In 2010, the agency filed fewer than 100 suits against borrowers and their families. Last year, it filed over 1, 600. (Some could result from federal loans handled by New Jersey, though such loans make up just 4 percent of the agencyâ€™s portfolio.) The cases are handled by debt collectors, who can tack on another 30 percent in fees on top of the outstanding debt. Marcia Karrow, the authorityâ€™s chief of staff, said that â€œthe vast majority of these borrowers are happy with the program. â€ She added that New Jerseyâ€™s loans had â€œsome of the lowest default ratesâ€ in the country. But when asked to produce the annual default rates, the agency sent ProPublica and The Times data only for students with strong credit scores, making it impossible to calculate the overall rate. A spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie said the governor did not control the authority and declined to respond to questions about the loan program. But Mr. Christie, a Republican, appointed its executive director, Gabrielle Charette he also has the power to appoint at least 12 of the agencyâ€™s 18 board members and can veto any action taken by the board. Besides administering the loan program, the authority provides financial aid counseling, conducting hundreds of financial aid nights at New Jersey high schools, where it offers advice about paying for college, including pitching its own loans. Ms.   who emigrated from Brazil and had long worked as a nanny while raising her son as a single mother, always knew that paying for his college education would be a challenge. Even after marrying her husband when Kevin DeOliveira was in middle school, she knew that their combined income would not be enough to cover the costs. A friend told her about New Jerseyâ€™s program. That, along with a combination of scholarships, grants and other loans, allowed Mr. DeOliveira to enroll at the University of Vermont. Since her son was fatally shot, Ms.   has made 18 payments to New Jersey. Paying $180 per month, she has about 92 to go. â€œWeâ€™re not going to be poor because of this,â€ she said. â€œBut every time I have to pay this thing, I think in my head, this is so unfair. â€ For decades, states served as middlemen for federal student loans. Most of the loans were made by banks and were handled and backed by regional and   agencies as well as by the federal government. The arrangement was unwieldy, expensive and marked by scandal. After Pennsylvaniaâ€™s student loan agency lost a public records lawsuit in 2007, documents revealed that the agency had spent nearly $1 million on things like   facials and falconry lessons. That same year, New Jerseyâ€™s agency was caught in what amounted to a kickback scheme. The state attorney general found that the agency had improperly pushed one companyâ€™s loans in exchange for annual payments of $2. 2 million. A subsequent investigation by the stateâ€™s inspector general found that the agency was in â€œdisarray. â€ In 2010, Congress and the Obama administration decided to effectively eliminate the role of state agencies by having only the federal government lend directly to students. Some states, like California, decided to downsize and transferred their federal loan portfolios. Others, such as Pennsylvania, won contracts from the federal government to service debt from the federal loan program. New Jersey chose a different path. In the years leading up to the end of the federal program, New Jersey sharply expanded its loan program, slowly replacing the federal loans it once handled with state loans. From 2005 to 2010, loans from the agency nearly tripled, to $343 million per year. Since then, the agency has reduced its loans by half, but its outstanding portfolio has remained roughly the same, about $2 billion. Ms. Karrow said the growth of New Jerseyâ€™s program was simply a result of both the increasing number of students and the rising cost of tuition. But in fact, college enrollment and tuition have not grown as rapidly as the programâ€™s size. While other states have similar loan programs, New Jerseyâ€™s stands apart, for both its size and its onerous terms. Massachusetts, running the   program, with $1. 3 billion in outstanding loans, automatically cancels debt if a borrower dies or becomes disabled, something many other states also do. The program of the   state lender, Texas, is half the size of New Jerseyâ€™s. And Texas offers a flat interest rate, a modest 4. 5 percent, while New Jerseyâ€™s rates can reach nearly 8 percent. Some other state loan programs have more flexible repayment options  â€”   Rhode Island, for example, offers   repayment. New Jersey, meanwhile, encourages students to buy life insurance in case they die to help   repay. As an agency pamphlet cautions, â€œAre you prepared for the unthinkable?â€ The agency, Ms. Karrow said, treats each instance of a deceased borrower case by case and tries to be compassionate, but, she added, â€œwe must also meet our fiduciary duty to our bondholders. â€ When consumer lawyers protested the programâ€™s onerous conditions at a 2014 agency meeting, the agency, according to minutes from the session, said that giving borrowers a break would make the bonds sold to finance loans â€œless attractive to the ratings agencies and investors. â€ Indeed, in a recent bond assessment, the credit rating agency Moodyâ€™s cited the authorityâ€™s â€œadministrative wage garnishing, which it uses aggressively,â€ for â€œsignificantly higher collectionsâ€ compared with other programs. A New Jersey rule adopted in 1998 allows the authority to give borrowers in default a second chance by allowing them to become current on their account through   payments. But the agency has never granted a reprieve and instead cuts off contact with borrowers, leaving them at the mercy of collection firms. Ms. Karrow said federal regulations prohibited the agency from offering such relief, but student loan experts disputed that assertion. â€œThere is nothing in the federal law or regulations that prohibits them from offering private loan rehabilitation, â€ Mark Kantrowitz, a   expert, said. The combination of a lack of flexibility, an unwillingness to discharge loans and the stateâ€™s power to seize wages has resulted in even â€œmore intractable problems for our clients than predatory mortgages, deceptive car loans or illegal internet payday lending,â€ said David McMillin, a lawyer with Legal Services of New Jersey, a nonprofit that provides free legal assistance to   state residents. â€œMany borrowers and   find themselves facing a lifetime of debt problems. â€ Given the lack of options, some New Jersey borrowers have resorted to declaring bankruptcy, even though, as is true of all student loans, their debt is rarely canceled. Declaring bankruptcy also makes it virtually impossible to secure a mortgage, lease a car or even use credit cards for years. But for New Jersey borrowers, such an extreme step at least offers a way to gain manageable monthly payment terms. As a   Tracey Timony struggled to help pay off her daughterâ€™s $140, 000 in loans. Though the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority can seize wages or tax returns without court approval, it must secure a judgment to dip into borrowersâ€™ bank accounts or place liens on their property. Instead of garnishing Ms. Timonyâ€™s wages, New Jersey sued her after her daughter defaulted. â€œThe agency is looking to put as much pressure on the borrower and be as aggressive as possible, and the way that you do that is you go after everybody that is liable,â€ Jennifer Weil, a New Jersey student debt lawyer, said. â€œIn case the garnishment doesnâ€™t work, a judgment will help put pressure on the parents. â€ Ms. Timony declared bankruptcy and got monthly debt payments that will rise no higher than about $1, 000 a month, far less than what the agency had demanded. â€œI never thought that sending my daughter to college would ruin our lives,â€ Ms. Timony said. Few have felt the weight of the agencyâ€™s powers more than Mr. Gonzalez, the college graduate who was sued after receiving a diagnosis of cancer and losing his job. He had borrowed the maximum he could in federal loans  â€”   a total of about $30, 000 for five years  â€”   and paid for most of his tuition with loans from New Jersey. â€œI felt so comfortable because it was the State of New Jersey,â€ Mr. Gonzalez said. â€œItâ€™s the state, my government, trying to help me out and achieve my American dream. It turns out they were the worst ones. â€ Over five years, he took out over $180, 000 in state loans. Unlike most other states, New Jersey does not impose a strict cap on loans to discourage overborrowing. One family, according to a recent state audit of the agency, took out over $800, 000 in loans, more than five times the value of its home. Mr. Gonzalezâ€™s loans had a relatively high interest rate  â€”   on average about 7. 5 percent. At the time it seemed like a good investment. He graduated with an engineering degree from   Aeronautical University in Florida and landed a job on Wall Street working as a programmer for Goldman Sachs. But a few months after he started, unusual rashes began to appear on his legs and underarms. He learned he had  â€™s lymphoma and started radiation therapy. After three years of cancer treatments, Mr. Gonzalez was also laid off. He needed to take care of his student loans. The federal government and his private lenders all deferred his debt for at least six months. Mr. Gonzalez expected New Jersey to do the same, but the agency refused, requiring him to pay at least $500 a month. With unemployment checks as his only income and burdened by continuing health expenses, it was too much for him. He made no payments while the agency reviewed his case. In June 2014, Mr. Gonzalez moved to Florida to lower his cost of living. His health slowly improved and he started his own company, developing technology for small businesses. In his first year, he made just $26, 000, but he started to pay back his federal and private bank loans. On May 8, 2015, after months of hearing nothing, he received an email from New Jersey: His deferral request had been denied and his loan was being sent to a collection agency. â€œUnfortunately, because of how the loan originated, the authority is not in a position to offer forbearance or relief,â€ Robert Laird, a program officer at the loan agency, said in the email. Terrified by what a default would mean for his credit rating, Mr. Gonzalez told the agency that he would stop paying for health insurance and use the money  â€”   $200 per month  â€”   to repay the loans. The agency rejected the offer. â€œIn the event that your doctor declares you total and permanently disabled, please keep me posted,â€ Mr. Laird told Mr. Gonzalez in an email. One day in April, a stranger rang Mr. Gonzalezâ€™s doorbell. â€œChris Gonzalez?â€ he asked. Mr. Gonzalez nodded. â€œYouâ€™ve been served with a lawsuit from the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority. â€ The suit demanded over $260, 000  â€”   about $188, 000 for the original loans, $34, 000 in interest, and $44, 000 to cover the fees of a collection agencyâ€™s lawyer. Even if his business improves, Mr. Gonzalez has no idea how he will afford his ballooning payments. â€œI donâ€™t have money,â€ he said. â€œI am spending it all on my debt. â€"

(Disney Animation Studios and its corporate sibling, Pixar, now hold the top six spots on that Thanksgiving records list.) Costing at least $300 million to make and market worldwide, â€œMoanaâ€ took in an additional $16. 3 million in limited overseas release, including in China, where the response was muted. â€œMoana,â€ which navigated various controversies en route to theaters, including one over an   Halloween   and one over an oversize male character, is a   musical   Miranda, the virtuoso behind the Broadway smash â€œHamilton,â€ contributed to the score. After a fallow period in the 2000s, when Pixar reigned supreme, Disney Animation Studios has delivered one successful original film after another, including â€œTangled,â€ â€œFrozen,â€ â€œ  Ralphâ€ and, earlier this year, â€œZootopia. â€ Pixar, lately focused more intently on sequels, has recently had an uneven track record with originals, finding a blockbuster in â€œInside Outâ€ but fizzling with â€œThe Good Dinosaur. â€ Among other new   offerings, Robert Zemeckisâ€™s period spy drama, â€œAlliedâ€ (Paramount) did the best, collecting about $18 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Had the film not cost a hefty $85 million to make  â€”   not including marketing expenses  â€”   that sales total would have been fine. As it is, â€œAllied,â€ which drew soft reviews, will likely go down as another misfire for Mr. Zemeckis and Paramount. The studio is counting on foreign audiences to pick up the slack in partial overseas release, â€œAllied,â€ starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, took in $9. 4 million. â€œBad Santa 2â€ (Broad Green) fared poorly. Costing an estimated $26 million to make, it sold about $9 million in tickets. The original â€œBad Santa,â€ now considered a crude comedy classic, arrived to $22 million in Thanksgiving ticket sales in 2003, after adjusting for inflation. Bombing outright was Warren Beattyâ€™s â€œRules Donâ€™t Apply,â€ a romantic comedic drama set in the late 1950s. Independently financed for $27 million and distributed by 20th Century Fox, â€œRules Donâ€™t Applyâ€ collected a breathtakingly bad $2. 2 million for the   period. The movie likely suffered from mixed reviews, Mr. Beattyâ€™s   absence from movie screens and   marketing materials that failed to make the film seem relevant to contemporary  . Even so, it was a strong weekend over all for Hollywood, as a broad array of movies, including the   arrival of the Weinstein Companyâ€™s â€œLion,â€ and sizzling holdovers, including â€œFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,â€ generated wide audience interest. For the year to date, total ticket sales in North America stand at $10. 1 billion, a 4. 5 percent increase from the same period a year ago."

The website for the march, which is slated for the deadline for Americans to file their tax returns, claims that its mission is to get Trump to release his tax returns and more. The site relates: President Trump needs to be straight with the American people. To whom does he owe favors? Who are his policies really intended to benefit? Who will he put first? Working families are struggling to make ends meet, but we pay our fair share in taxes  â€”   does Donald Trump pay any at all?

20935,"Janet Reno, First Woman to Serve as U.S. Attorney General, Dies at 78 - The New York Times",Carl Hulse,"Janet Reno, who rose from a rustic life on the edge of the Everglades to become attorney general of the United States  â€”   the first woman to hold the job  â€”   and whose eight years in that office placed her in the middle of some of the most divisive episodes of the Clinton presidency, died on Monday at her home in   County, Fla. She was 78. Her sister, Margaret Hurchalla, said the cause was complications of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, which was diagnosed in November 1995, while Ms. Reno was still in office. Ms. Renoâ€™s tenure as attorney general was bracketed by two explosive events: a deadly federal raid on the compound of a religious cult in Waco, Tex. in 1993, and in 2000  the governmentâ€™s seizing of EliÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez, a young Cuban refugee who was at the center of an international custody battle and a political tug of war. In those moments and others, Ms. Reno was applauded for displaying integrity and a willingness to accept responsibility, but she was also fiercely criticized. Republicans accused her of protecting President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore when, in 1997, she refused to allow an independent counsel to investigate allegations of   improprieties in the White House. After leaving office, she mounted a surprise though unsuccessful bid in Florida in 2002 to unseat Gov. Jeb Bush, the brother of President George W. Bush, amid the resentment of   in South Florida over her negotiating for the return of EliÃ¡n to Cuba. Ms. Reno was never part of the Clinton inner circle, even though she served in the Clinton cabinet for two terms, longer than any attorney general in the previous 150 years. She was a latecomer to the team, and her political and personal style clashed with the presidentâ€™s, particularly as she sought to maintain some independence from the White House. Her relations with the president were further strained by her decision to let an independent inquiry into a failed Clinton land deal in Arkansas, the   Whitewater investigation, expand to encompass Mr. Clintonâ€™s sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky, an episode that led to his impeachment. Mr. Clinton and his allies thought that Ms. Reno was too quick to refer to special counsels in the Lewinsky matter and other cases of suspect administration behavior. The president let her dangle in the public eye for weeks before announcing in December 1996, after his resounding   that she would remain for his second term. Ms. Reno was never a natural fit in Washingtonâ€™s backslapping, competitive culture. At weekly news conferences, held in the   conference room outside her office in the Justice Department building on Pennsylvania Avenue, she was fond of telling reporters that she would â€œdo the right thingâ€ on legal issues and judge them according to â€œthe law and the facts. â€ Imposing at    awkward in manner and blunt in her probity, she became a regular foil for   comics and a running gag on â€œSaturday Night Live. â€ But she got the joke, proving it by gamely appearing on the show to lampoon her image. The comedy could not obscure her   accomplishments. Ms. Reno presided over the Justice Department in a time of economic growth, falling crime rates and mounting security threats to the nation by forces both foreign and domestic. Under Ms. Reno, the agency initiated prosecutions in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, helping to lay the groundwork for the pursuit of terrorists in the 21st century. The Reno Justice Department also prosecuted spies like the C. I. A. mole Aldrich H. Ames it filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft, a milestone in the   era and it sued the tobacco industry to reclaim federal health care dollars spent on treating illnesses caused by smoking. Ms. Reno was a strong advocate of guaranteeing federal protection to women seeking abortions and safeguarding abortion clinics that were under threat. But in some areas she seemed conflicted about the law. She opposed the death penalty, for example, but repeatedly authorized her prosecutors to ask juries to impose it. When she took office, she endorsed the use of independent counsels to investigate administration figures. But she later testified against renewing the law governing their use, saying it did nothing to take politics out of the inquiries. Before becoming attorney general, Ms. Reno was the Dade County state attorney for 14 years, when the Miami area was growing rapidly and experiencing rising   crime, widening racial divisions, demoralizing police corruption and waves of immigration from Cuba. Mr. Clinton, committed to appointing a woman as attorney general, settled on Ms. Reno after his first two choices  â€”   the corporate lawyer ZoÃ« Baird and the federal judge Kimba Wood  â€”   withdrew their names in the face of criticism after it was disclosed that they had employed undocumented immigrants as nannies. â€œIâ€™m just delighted to be here, and Iâ€™m going to try my level best,â€ Ms. Reno said at the Rose Garden ceremony at which Mr. Clinton announced her nomination on Feb. 11, 1993. Two months later, she gained the nationâ€™s full attention in a dramatic televised news conference in which she took full responsibility for a botched federal raid of the Waco compound of the Branch Davidians, an offshoot of the   Adventists. The assault, after a long siege involving close to 900 military and   personnel and a dozen tanks, left the compound in flames and the groupâ€™s charismatic leader, David Koresh, and about 75 others dead. A third of the dead were children. Ms. Renoâ€™s candor was viewed as refreshing in a city where blame shifting is the norm, and it gave her sudden celebrity status in the new administration. The luster faded quickly. Within weeks, Ms. Reno faced tough questions about the raid and her claim that children were being abused at the compound. She was also faulted for failing to influence an important crime bill. By the end of her first year in office, she was facing mounting scrutiny in the news media. With Mr. Clintonâ€™s   and his decision to keep Ms. Reno at her post, Republicans began questioning her independence when she resisted their calls for a special counsel to look into allegations that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had broken campaign   laws in 1996. The clamor, led by the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, grew when it was disclosed that Louis J. Freeh, the head of the F. B. I. also favored a special counsel. Ms. Reno would not budge, saying her stance had nothing to do with protecting the president. A review of the evidence, she said, convinced her that a special counsel was not warranted. â€œLet me be absolutely clear,â€ Ms. Reno told hostile Republican questioners during one of several hearings on Capitol Hill about the call for a special counsel. â€œIâ€™m not going to violate my oath in this matter because of pressure from any quarter, not from the media, not from Congress, nor from anywhere else. â€ Questions about her handling of the Waco raid resurfaced in 1999, when new evidence suggested that the F. B. I. might have started the fire that destroyed the compound. The disclosure further soured her dealings with Mr. Freeh  â€”   a relationship that had been close early in her tenure but had grown tortured by 1999. He let it be known that he favored a special counsel in the   case and a new inquiry into Waco. She sent marshals to F. B. I. headquarters to seize a tape of communications made the day of the assault. Her final and perhaps most personal crisis as head of the Justice Department was the case involving EliÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez, the    Cuban boy who was found floating on an inner tube off the coast of Florida after his mother and 10 others had drowned in a failed crossing from Cuba by small boat. The boy became a unifying figure among Cuban exiles in South Florida, who were determined to see him remain in the United States in defiance of the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. Ms. Reno favored returning EliÃ¡n to his father in Cuba, and she became immersed in negotiations over his fate because of her ties to Miami. Ms. Reno was on the phone almost up to the moment agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service burst into the Miami home of EliÃ¡nâ€™s relatives and took him away at gunpoint. Congressional Republicans and many Cuban exiles were outraged. Some in Miami said Ms. Reno would be in danger if she returned there after her service in Washington. Early in 2001, however, she did go home, her service finished. She said she was excited about a red pickup truck she had bought. Janet Reno was born in Miami, on the edge of the Everglades, on July 21, 1938, to Henry Olaf Reno and the former Jane Wood. Her father, born Henry Rasmussen in Denmark, came to the United States in 1913 with his own mother and father, who chose the name Reno off a map, believing it sounded more American. Henry Reno was a police reporter in Dade County for more than 40 years. Jane Reno, born in Georgia, was an eccentric naturalist who would have a profound effect on Ms. Reno. â€œOutspoken, outrageous, absolutely indifferent to othersâ€™ opinions, Jane Reno was truly one of a kind,â€ Paul Anderson, a former Miami Herald reporter, wrote in his biography of Janet Reno. It was her mother who had wrestled small alligators, though the stunt was sometimes erroneously ascribed to the daughter. Ms. Reno, the eldest of four siblings, was about 8 when her parents bought 21 acres bordering the Everglades and moved there. Her mother, who had no construction experience, built the family home. â€œShe dug the foundation with her own hands, with a pick and shovel,â€ Ms. Reno told senators at her confirmation hearing in 1993. It was a rustic life peacocks and other creatures roamed the property, and Janet and her siblings  â€”   Robert, Mark and Margaret  â€”   cavorted barefoot. But she also glimpsed a more sophisticated world: After junior high school, she traveled to Europe to stay with an uncle, a military judge, as he presided over a spy trial. Besides her sister, who is known as Maggy, Ms. Reno is survived by seven nieces and nephews. Her brother Robert, a former columnist for Newsday on Long Island, died in 2012 at 72. Her brother Mark had an adventurerâ€™s life: game warden, boat and oil supply ship captain, alligator wrestler, scuba diver, paratrooper as well as carpenter and bailiff at the   Justice Building. He died in 2014, also at 72. After finishing high school in Miami, Ms. Reno attended Cornell University, graduating in 1960 with a degree in chemistry. She won admission to Harvard Law School and graduated in 1963, one of a handful of women in her class of more than 500. Seeking to practice law in South Florida, Ms. Reno was turned down by one of the stateâ€™s   law firms, Steel Hector  Davis, and went to work for a smaller firm instead. She became active in local Democratic politics and met a fellow Harvard graduate, Gerald Lewis, a lawyer with electoral aspirations. Ms. Reno helped him win a State House seat in 1966, and the two opened a   law firm together. Ms. Reno entered government service in 1971 as general counsel to the Judiciary Committee of the Florida House of Representatives, where she worked on a difficult overhaul of Floridaâ€™s courts. Her work in Tallahassee, the capital, whetted her appetite for public office, and she campaigned for a state legislative seat of her own the next year. She lost in an upset to a Republican candidate helped by the landslide   victory of President Richard M. Nixon. Ms. Reno did not wait long for her next opportunity. The day after her defeat, Richard Gerstein, the state attorney for Dade County, offered her a job on his staff. As she told The Miami Herald, she expressed reservations in her characteristically straightforward manner. â€œMy father was always convinced you were a crook,â€ she said she told Mr. Gerstein. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve always been a critic of yours. â€ Mr. Gerstein replied that those were the reasons he wanted to hire her. Within a few years, she was Mr. Gersteinâ€™s chief assistant. Ms. Reno left the prosecutorâ€™s office in May 1976 to join Steel Hector  Davis, the firm that had rejected her out of law school. But her tenure there was short. After Mr. Gerstein announced that he would resign in early 1978, after 21 years in the office, Gov. Reubin Askew appointed Ms. Reno interim state attorney, choosing her from about 50 candidates. She was the first woman to hold the title of state attorney in Florida and one of the few in the nationâ€™s history to be responsible for such a large jurisdiction. Ms. Reno retained the post through a thicket of drug, murder and corruption cases. In one, she was accused of being antipolice when she prosecuted five Miami officers in the beating death of a black insurance executive after a traffic stop the officers, she said, had tried to make it look like an accident. The officers were acquitted  â€”   one by the presiding judge in the trial, held in Tampa, and the others by an   jury  â€”   provoking criticism of her legal strategy and four days of deadly riots in Miamiâ€™s predominantly black Liberty City neighborhood. To quell the furor, Ms. Reno undertook an outreach effort that restored some support among Miamiâ€™s black citizens. She remained state attorney through five election campaigns  â€”   until February 1993, when the White House called. Ms. Reno was formally nominated to be attorney general that month, just a few weeks after the death of her mother, Jane, the guiding influence in her life. She invoked her motherâ€™s memory in her remarks that day at the Rose Garden ceremony with Mr. Clinton. â€œMy mother always told me to do my best,â€ she said, â€œto think my best and to do right. â€"
20936,Germany Proposes Tougher Measures to Combat Terrorism - The New York Times,Alison Smale,"BERLIN  â€”   The German government proposed a broad range of measures on Thursday to bolster security and combat terrorism, its strongest official response so far to two recent attacks by terrorists pledging loyalty to the Islamic State and a deadly shooting rampage in Munich. Many of the measures, which include closer monitoring of refugees and enhanced surveillance, seem likely to win legislative approval but prompted concerns in a country that is deeply protective of privacy and civil liberties. The package of proposals is the most comprehensive from the German government since Europe became a consistent target of terrorist attacks by the Islamic State, other radical groups and their followers. They were unveiled at a time when Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations that the welcome she gave last year to migrants streaming to the Continent from Syria and other nations in the Middle East has compromised security. The German plan, and the response to it, reflected a broader tension in the West over how to balance steps to combat terrorism against civil liberties and political realities amid a resurgence in populism, nationalism and   sentiment. The proposals announced by the interior minister, Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re, call for hiring more federal police officers making it a crime to express sympathy for terrorism greater sharing of intelligence data across Europe closer watching of the â€œdark web,â€ the part of the internet that is invisible to ordinary users stripping dual citizens of their German citizenship if they fight for extremist groups and making it easier to deport foreigners deemed to be dangerous. Strengthening the federal governmentâ€™s   powers is particularly fraught for a country where the legacies of Nazi and Communist control have left a deep suspicion of centralized authority and official surveillance, and where the powers of the central government remain limited because of the history of totalitarian control. Ralf Stegner, a leading Social Democrat, said that the plan was the clear result of â€œpublic pressure in the last few weeks,â€ which made terrorism more a reality than an abstraction. In a phone interview, Mr. Stegner said his party supported hiring additional police officers, upgrading technology, investigating the dark web and improving cooperation with other European countries, but was more skeptical of a proposal by Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re to restrict certain rights of migrants whose asylum applications have been denied but who cannot easily be deported. Mr. Stegner noted that France  â€”   despite a state of emergency in place since terrorist attacks in and around Paris last November  â€”   has not managed to halt further attacks, and that â€œthe mood there, and the situation, are quite differentâ€ from Germany. Last year, 1. 1 million foreigners migrated to Germany  â€”   a record  â€”   and the country received 442, 000 asylum applications. Ms. Merkel has insisted that Germany can successfully assimilate the newcomers, but the recent attacks have strained the coalition government she leads. With elections in two states in September and a national vote next year, Ms. Merkelâ€™s   Christian Democrats and their coalition partners, the   Social Democrats, worry that the populist,   Alternative for Germany party could make strong gains. In announcing the measures on Thursday, Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re emphasized that Germany â€œmust changeâ€ in the face of new threats, by showing enhanced vigilance, deploying new technologies and even, in some cases, overriding strong   War II concerns about privacy. He said he wanted to install sophisticated video equipment in about 20 significant railroad stations, and to improve the sharing of surveillance footage among law enforcement agencies, adding that the shooting rampage in Munich, at a shopping mall, showed that public spaces were potential â€œsoft targetsâ€ for terrorists. The Munich rampage, which killed nine people, was the work of a teenager, Ali Sonboly, who had been in psychiatric treatment and was fascinated by previous mass shootings. The pistol he used, a Glock 17, was a former theater weapon, apparently bought on the internet, that had been restored to be able to shoot live rounds. Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re proposed much tighter European regulations to register such weapon conversions and to crack down on internet arms sales. Similarly, his proposals to monitor newly arrived refugees and people susceptible to radicalization seemed aimed at preventing terrorist attacks like the two by Islamic State adherents last month. The first, on July 18, was carried out by a person identified only as a    Afghan who was living with a foster family in Bavaria. He wounded four people on a train with an ax and a knife, and then attacked a woman walking her dog he was later shot by the police. Six days later, in Germanyâ€™s first Islamist suicide attack, a    Syrian blew himself up outside a music festival in the Bavarian town of Ansbach and wounded 15. The authorities had previously ordered him deported, and, on Thursday, Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re announced further measures to make it easier to deport foreign criminals. â€œNobody can guarantee absolute security,â€ Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re said. â€œBut we must do everything in our powerâ€ to try to ensure safety. â€œOne thing is sure,â€ he added, â€œour country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hate and division. We will not allow the terrorists that triumph. â€ Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re reiterated publicly concerns previously voiced privately by senior intelligence officials that Germany  â€”   and Europe  â€”   does not always know enough about migrants. He noted that the recent decision to register air travelers in and out of Europe was an improvement, and he urged that all of Germanyâ€™s federal and state law enforcement and intelligence officials should have access to that information. â€œWe see in recent months that these offices must know exactly who is coming to Europe, and who is leaving it,â€ he said. Other measures he proposed included combing the social media profiles of refugees and other migrants to look out for signs of radicalization, as the authorities in the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have done. In a statement, Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re said that officials could have gleaned more information after a bomb threat at a mall in Dortmund if officials had had access to surveillance footage, which he said had been restricted by data protection officials. â€œOverall, we must extend and optimize our use of I. T. â€ he said, referring to information technology. Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re said that the government had approved adding 4, 600 security jobs, 3, 250 of them in the federal police force, which, under the structure largely set up by the Allies after World War II, has traditionally taken a back seat to the police in the countryâ€™s 16 states. The German press had speculated that the government would propose punishing doctors who failed to inform the authorities if they suspected patients of potentially committing violent acts. But patient confidentiality is taken very seriously in Germany, given the involvement of doctors in the crimes of the Nazi era doctors can be punished for breaching patient privacy, with certain exceptions. Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re said on Thursday that the government would not change the principle of protecting patients, but he urged doctors to contact the government if they believe a patient is dangerous or about to commit a crime. Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the president of the German Medical Association, said in a statement that he was relieved â€œthat medical confidentiality is not to be called into question. â€ Mr. de MaiziÃ¨re also rejected as â€œconstitutionally problematicâ€ other ideas that some conservative lawmakers have floated, including a ban on burqas."
20937,How Easy-to-hack Voting Machines Endanger Democracy,nan,"How Easy-to-hack Voting Machines Endanger Democracy   Source: Who What Why 
Since the â€œHelp America Vote Actâ€ in 2002, tallying votes in our elections has become dependent on machines that sometimes leave no paper trail. Manufacturers have â€œproprietaryâ€ programs and will not let any public officials or independent experts examine them. 
On a cold winter day in 2007, Andrew Appel, a Princeton computer professor and election specialist, changed the outcome on one of these machines in seven minutes. He proved something that should alarm everyone: in effect, it took seven minutes per machine to steal an election. 
In testimony to a House of Representatives Technology Committee on September 28, 2016, which is now suddenly paying attention because of the fear of â€œRussianâ€ hacking, Appel noted: 
â€œInstalling new software in a voting machine is not really much different from installing new software in any other kind of computer. Installing new software is how you hack a voting machine to cheat. In 2009, in the courtroom of the Superior Court of New Jersey, I demonstrated how to hack a voting machine. I wrote a vote-stealing computer program that shifts votes from one candidate to another. Installing that vote-stealing program in a voting machine takes seven minutes, per machine, with a screwdriver.â€ 
Machines were initially adopted for vote counting over a century ago,because they promised speed and convenience. They can tally results more quickly than a more reliable and re-checkable hand count. 
From the beginning, there were ways to corrupt non-computerized machines, Appel said. One such ploy was the â€œpencil shaving trick.â€ Putting shavings on the lever of an opposition party would choke off counting ballots until the shavings came loose and fell free. 
While this left a tell-tale discrepancy between the counted results and the number of voters who signed in at that polling place to vote, the scam worked if no one checked. Latest Computers Easier to Hack . 
You might think the advent of computerized voting machines, starting around 2002, would have made it harder to corrupt vote counting. In fact, even the latest generation of such machines are much easier to hack without leaving a trace. 
These machines are big money-makers for private corporations, which lobbied legislators about their supposed advantages. But they also pose a serious threat to the integrity of our elections. 
DRE Direct-Recording Electronic or â€œtouchscreenâ€ voting machines that leave no paper trail will be mainly used by voters in 14 states, according to the Brennan Center,. Those states include Georgia, and Pennsylvania â€” which are in play this year. Even large regions of Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina and many other states still use them. Among the brand names are Shouptronic , AVC Advantage , AccuVote OS , Optech-III Eagle . 
Most of these machines are over 10 years old, and the local authorities have no manuals for maintenance and repair. Claiming a lack of funds, state legislatures have refused to replace them. 
In 14 states, either computer error or Appel-like reprogramming could distort results. Without a paper trail, the only way to check the tally is through â€œinitialâ€ exit polling conducted throughout the full span of voting hours and ending when the polls close.

Touchscreen machines were widely used in Ohio in the 2004 Kerry-Bush election, the only one of 154 American contests that year in which initial exit polling, which is ordinarily reliable, was markedly out of sync with the officially announced total. Those who know about computers have long been skeptical of this result. 
As Appel has demonstrated, tt takes no super-hacking skills to alter voting counts: â€œI did this in a secure facility and Iâ€™m confident my program has not leaked out to affect real elections, but really the software I built was not rocket science â€” any computer programmer could write the same code. Once itâ€™s installed, it could steal elections without detection for years to come.â€ 

But if computer experts can hack every variety of touchscreen machine, what about foreign governments or domestic organizations? 
â€œOther computer scientists have demonstrated similar hacks on many models of machine,â€ Appel added. â€œThis is not just one glitch in one manufacturerâ€™s machine, itâ€™s the very nature of computers.â€ 
In late July and early August, columns by Hiawatha Bray in the Boston Globe, and Zeynep Tufekci of The New York Times questioned for the first time whether voting in American elections is secure from such hacking â€” with suspicion directed, though without evidence, primarily at Russia. Suddenly, the disorganization and lack of transparency of American vote counting had become a National Security Issue. 
In late September, the US House of Representatives Subcommittee on Information Technology held hearings on â€œ Cybersecurity: Ensuring the Integrity of the Ballot Box.â€ 
Weighing in on the issue, President Barack Obama pointed out that most American elections are local or state, done under diverse procedures and laws, and involving a large number of voters. Even if particular computers, or a system of computers connected to the Internet, could be hacked from the outside, it would be hard for a foreign or domestic outlaw to falsify the results of a national election. 
On the surface, this is a heartening thought. But consider a close election like 2004. A targeted hack â€” say, altering one candidateâ€™s vote by an algorithm that kicks in as precincts increase in size â€” might alter the outcome in certain key counties in a swing state 
In addition, voter registration lists are centralized and kept on the Internet. During the Arizona and New York primaries, many Democrats, often younger ones, reported that their registration was changed without their knowledge. They were listed as a Republican or Independent or with no year of registration indicated; as a result, they couldnâ€™t vote in their partyâ€™s primary. 
This turned out to have been done by election officials â€œby accident,â€ and perhaps also by hackers via Internet access. Bones to Pick with Bipartisan Watchdogs . 
Now elections are watched over by bipartisan committees in which Appel has some confidence. At least, he points out, such supervision does not depend on a single powerful party or leader: 
â€œWhen we elect our government officials, sometimes we are voting for or against the very person or political party who is in office right now, running that very election! How can we trust that this person is running the election fairly? The answer is, we organize our elections so we donâ€™t have to trust any single person or party. 
â€œThatâ€™s why, when you go to the polls in most places, there are typically two poll-workers there, often (by law) from different political parties; and there are poll-watchers, representing the parties to make sure everything is done right. Thatâ€™s why recounts are done in the presence of witnesses from both parties. We run our elections transparently so the parties can watch each other, and the result is that even the losing candidate can trust that the election was run fairly. â€œ 
But there are two problems here. So-called bipartisanship means that third parties, such as the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, are by definition excluded. 
In addition, many aspects of the process end up in the hands of a single individual. Chief Clerk of Elections Diane Haslett-Rudiano arbitrarily stripped 123,000 people from the Brooklyn voter rolls in this yearâ€™s New York Democratic primary. She was later fired by the Board of Elections â€” after the.election was over . Systemic Weak Points . 
But Appel is even more worried about a systemic weak point in the electoral process. 
â€œVoting machines are often delivered to polling places several days before the election â€” to elementary schools, churches, firehouses. In these locations anyone could gain access to a voting machine for 10 minutes. Between elections the machines are routinely opened up for maintenance by county employees or private contractors. Letâ€™s assume they have the utmost integrity, but still, in the US we try to run our elections so that we can trust the election results without relying on any one individual.â€ The Necessity of Recountable Paper Ballots . 
The only sure way to run a fair election, Appel says, is to use and keep paper ballots. In 2009, Germany adopted a system in which an initial exit poll is announced immediately after voting closes â€” this determines a range of plausible results within a margin of error â€” and then paper ballots are counted by hand. They have, since that time, had no major controversies about electoral fairness. 
Appel testified that newer, optical screen voting machines can be equally secure if paper ballots are kept and checked. Premier Optical Scan with Automark is used, in parts of California, Colorado, and since 2008, under Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner, in parts of Ohio. Often, these involve entering your vote, and leaving a record, which you see in the machine, on a paper tape, of how your ballot was cast. 
But there are two striking problems with even these somewhat better machines. First, in 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency discovered that Volkswagens had an internal computer program which had long passed US emission tests, but polluted forty times more on the road . The cars were able to recognize when they were being tested (and had to keep the emission controls switched on) and when they were on the road and could pollute at will without fear of being caught. As Barbara Simons of Verified Voting aptly put it, we do not want â€œVW-style elections.â€ 
Appelâ€™s mantra is: â€œany computer can be hacked.â€ 
Separating paper ballots physically from a computerized tape and keeping them in a different location, many computer experts believe, would provide further insurance against hacking even on optical scan machines. 
Second, challenging the results, particularly in a presidential election and even starting from an automatic recount, as Al Gore did in Florida in 2000, is very difficult. It would take a long time to recount the votes, even if the party in power were not trying to sabotage itâ€¦ 
So the most important thing, as in Germany, is to get each election right in the first place. Why, we might ask, have officials sold public elections and the equal right to vote â€” again, the most important public feature of our democracy â€” to private, profit-making corporations? Once again, these corporations, claiming their programs are â€œproprietaryâ€ secrets, do not allow any independent check of how they operate . 
A few states like New Mexico have adopted, Appel says, a model procedure for close or controversial elections: 
*Immediately conduct a random recount of part of the paper ballots. 
*If there is an error, do a full recount. 
*Do not certify an election until both are done.â€ 
Appel and nine other experts, including Lawrence Norden from the Democracy Program of the Brennan Center at the New York University Law School and John McCarthy of the Verified Voting Foundation, offered 10 suggestions for securing existing machines and registration lists. For instance, they underline that â€œwithout voter-verified paper ballots, effective audits are impossible; they recommend checking samples from the voting system with hand counts of matched sets of paper ballots, recruiting technical experts to help with such tests, and publicizing the results, before certification of the election. 
They also recommend a new, detailed ballot accounting by each polling center and reconciliation with the number of those who signed in to vote there. Still, to put these procedures into practice would probably require sustained pressure from the voting public. 
Moreover, anyone familiar with vote counting in precincts across the country knows that many computer checking and security measures these experts recommend are far too sophisticated for most poll-watchers to implement before the November 8 election. Further, all Secretaries of State, who are often unabashed political partisans, would have to have good intentions â€” an assumption hard to reconcile with the actions of Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio in 2004 or Katherine Harris in Florida in 2000. 
In contrast, consider the record of Dana Debeauvoir, election clerk in Travis County which includes the University of Texas (Austin). She has worked with critics and computer experts, to propose a new type of encryption plus a paper record (it will not be ready, unfortunately, until the 2020 election). 
A federal law requiring oversight of elections by politically independent or neutral state officials would vastly improve the security of the American electoral process. But Appel is not optimistic about the prospect of Congressionally mandated reforms. For the upcoming election, some of the recommended measures will be in place in some jurisdictions across the country. 
After this election, however, with a strong democratic push from below, it might be possible to outlaw the highly insecure DREs ( touch-screen machines), provide adequate funding as well as training for election officials nationwide, and ensure an independent paper trail on optical scan machines. 
In fact, it might even be possible to go to a paper ballot backed up by an initial exit poll. In contrast to this November 8 â€” when, at best, only the large scale of the election makes likely a trustworthy result â€” such reforms would ensure that our elections are, both in appearance and in reality, fair.

Standing Rock Protectors Strip-Searched, Jailed for Days on Minor Charges â€“ Video, Links, and Commentary Democracy Now! 
We discuss the crackdown on the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline with Winona LaDuke, a Native American activist and executive director of the group Honor the Earth who lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota, and Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. Police have begun deploying military-grade equipment, including armored personnel carriers, surveillance helicopters, planes and drones. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple activated the National Guard in late September. Roughly 140 people have been arrested. Some report being strip-searched in custody at the Morton County jail and being held for days without bond, even when they are facing minor misdemeanor charges. TRANSCRIPT This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. 
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . Weâ€™re broadcasting live from outside the courthouse and jail in Mandan, North Dakota. Water and land protectors, as they call themselves, report facing increasing repression amidst the ongoing resistance to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline. Police have begun deploying military-grade equipment, including armored personnel carriers, surveillance helicopters, planes and drones. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple activated the National Guard in late September. Roughly 140 people have been arrested. Some report being strip-searched in custody at the Morton County jail, even when theyâ€™re facing minor misdemeanor charges. This is Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : When I was taken to the jail, first I was taken by a corrections officer, transported from the protest site to the Morton County jail. And then, when they took me in there, you know, they had to take some basic information. And then, one of the things that they do is have you go into a small room, and there was a female officer there, and we had toâ€”I had to take my clothes off, and then, I donâ€™t know, basicallyâ€” 
AMY GOODMAN : Cavity search? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : No, not a cavity search, but I had to squat and cough. Thatâ€™s what she said. I had to squat and cough and then put the orange suit on. 
AMY GOODMAN : So you were put in an orange jumpsuit? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : Yeah, I was put in an orange jumpsuit. And then I was held there for several hours. And initially, you know, my family didnâ€™t know where I was or didnâ€™tâ€”you know, they heard about it pretty quickly and were able to come and bond me out or bail me out. I donâ€™t know what you call it. But I was in there for several hours. 
AMY GOODMAN : How did it make you feel? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : It made me feelâ€”you know, it made me think about my ancestors and what had they gone through. And this was in no way a comparison to what weâ€™ve survived before, so just made me feel more determined about what Iâ€™m doing and why Iâ€™m here. 
AMY GOODMAN : Thatâ€™s Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician, member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. She was charged with disorderly conduct. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who founded the first resistance camp, the Sacred Stone Camp, on her own land April 1st, says her daughter was recently arrested, taken into custody at the Morton County jail, strip-searched in front of multiple male officers, then left for hours in her cell, naked and freezing, before the guards finally gave her clothes to wear. LaDonna Allard says her daughter was repeatedly asked by guards, â€œWho is your mother?â€ which Allard sees as an indication that her daughter was targeted because of who she is. Cody Hall from Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota says he was also strip-searched after he was arrested Friday, September 9th, held for three days without bail or bond, and then charged with two misdemeanors. 
CODY HALL : As I exited out of the vehicles and entered Morton County, I came up an elevator, and as the elevator opened up, I was met with state police. And then, you know, of course, Morton County people were there to book people, butâ€”and then, from there, started the process of the booking, and then, again, you know, went into a private room, where they ask you to, you know, get naked. You know, they had my arms. They, you know, kind of like extend your arms out. And youâ€™re fully naked. And they have you, you know, lift up your genitals and bend over, you know, cough. And so, itâ€™s really one of those tactics that they try to break down your mentalness of everyday life, because not every day do you wake up and say, â€œHey, Iâ€™m going to get, you know, naked and have somebody search me today,â€ you know? Thatâ€™s a privateâ€”you know, thatâ€™s a private feeling for you, when you get naked, soâ€¦ 
AMY GOODMAN : And four days later, when you were finally releasedâ€”they hadnâ€™t allowed you to go out on bail or bond for those four daysâ€”you came before a judge in the orange jumpsuit? 
CODY HALL : Yes, yes, I sat in the court office in my orange jumpsuit, locked, you know, still handcuffed, exited out of the courtroom. And as I left the courtroom, there were 20 or so state police all in their bullet-proof vests, everything just looking, you know, likeâ€”you know, like theyâ€™re going into action of some sort. And then they literally had a line from the courtroom to the door that connects you to the county jail. And my mother walked out with me. And as we got to the door, they were opening the door up. And as I looked behind me, my mother and I, all of the cops then proceeded to kind of swarm, you know, like make, you know, that big wall as I entered in, which was, again, an overkill, you know, but that, too, though, to show a dominant force. 
AMY GOODMAN : That was Cody Hall, who was arrested on two misdemeanors, held for four days, strip-searched here at the Morton County jail just behind us. 
Well, for more on the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline and the police crackdown, weâ€™re joined by two guests.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Winona, letâ€™s start with you. We have spoken to you intermittently through this resistance. Where does it stand now? 
WINONA LADUKE : Well, as far as we are inâ€”I mean, Iâ€™m just looking at the big picture. Right now there is about 900,000 barrels per day of oil coming out of this state, and they project that into 2019. And so, what Iâ€™m trying to understand is, is that if thatâ€™s all they have and itâ€™s already going out, why do they need another pipeline of 570,000 barrels of oil per day? In other words, theyâ€™re already meeting all their demand. For the next two years, thatâ€™s all the oil thatâ€™s in there. And this is reallyâ€”what we call this is the Dakota Excess pipeline. 
AMY GOODMAN : The Dakota Excess. 
WINONA LADUKE : Dakota Excess pipeline. This is really about spites. Itâ€™s really about spite. 
AMY GOODMAN : What do you mean? 
WINONA LADUKE : Itâ€™s just really about hating. You know, itâ€™s just really about trying to put something in across these tribes. Itâ€™s exactly what the chairman and you said before: If they wanted this pipeline so damn bad, they should have put it north of Bismarck, you know, and they should haveâ€”they should not have violated the law. The whole pipeline was approved through something called the Nationwide Permit number 12, which means they could it into a lot of little pieces and never do an EIS , and pretend likeâ€”you know, thatâ€™s intended for like if you have like a pipeline from a school to the water service center or something like that. Itâ€™s not intended for a 1,600-mile pipeline. Total misuse of the law, you know, and the president really needs to intervene and uphold the lawâ€¦Read more and watch video at Democracy Now!"

20941,Robot Preacher Gives Automated Blessings and â€™Beams Lightsâ€™ from Hands - Breitbart,Charlie Nash,"A new robot preacher allows users to receive automated blessings in different languages before it beams light from its hands. [â€œ â€ is currently on display in Wittenberg, Germany, a town which has close ties to Protestant figure Martin Luther, and was created by the Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau, according to the Mirror.   â€œIt consists of a metal box with a touch screen, two arms on the side, a head with eyes and a digital mouth at the top,â€ the Mirror explained. â€œAfter the robot wishes users a â€˜warm welcome,â€™ it asks them if they want to be blessed by a male or female voice. It then asks the believer â€˜what blessing do you want,â€™ which results in the robot making a mechanical sound as it raises its arms to the heavens and starts to smile. â€ â€œLights then start to flash in the robotâ€™s arms as it says â€˜God bless and protect youâ€™ and recites a biblical verse,â€ the Mirror continued. â€œAfter the blessing, the user has the possibility to print the dictum,â€ similar to a fortune teller machine. The robot can communicate with users in five different languages, and the blessing can be printed out for them to take with them as well. Church spokesman Sebastian von Gehren claims that the new machine has attracted those who have very little in common with the church, but now routinely visit â€œevery morning and eveningâ€ to receive an automated blessing. â€œIt is an experiment that is supposed to inspire discussion,â€ he declared. â€œOne half thinks itâ€™s great  â€¦     the other cannot imagine a blessing from a machine. â€ Despite his praise of the robot, von Gehren added, â€œThe machine should not replace the blessing of a pastor. â€ â€œIn the future, there will not be a blessing robot in every church,â€ he concluded.

20942,Hillary Clinton: American Demagogue,Rixon Stewart,"By Rixon Stewart on October 27, 2016 Rixon Stewart â€” Oct 26, 2016 Donald Trump warned on Tuesday that Hillary Clintonâ€™s Syrian policy could ignite World War III. â€œShe has no plan for Syria. And, look, with her youâ€™ll end up in World War III. She doesnâ€™t know what sheâ€™s doing, just like with Libya, just like with everything else sheâ€™s done. So, Syria now is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and the new Iran, that we built through the Iran deal, which is the worstâ€”one of the worst negotiated deals Iâ€™ve ever seen.â€ ( democracynow.org ) Trump isnâ€™t alone in warning of the danger to world peace a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring. Russiaâ€™s President Vladimir Putin has also sounded a similar warning, telling reporters recently: â€œMrs Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russiaâ€ Putin was quoted as saying. Unfortunately the elite want to see WWIII unfold as they see it as a solution to their most pressing problem: too many useless eaters. As a result theyâ€™ve set into motion plans for a large-scale military clash between the West and Russia and its allies. The end result, they hope, will be massive depopulation. Leaving themselves as overlords and those few who survive as little more than serfs on their global plantation. To this end U.S., British, Canadian, Italian and German forces are all preparing to deploy to eastern Europe early next year. Although ostensibly to deter â€œRussian aggressionâ€, many of these combat ready units will be deployed within sight of Russiaâ€™s border. To those in Russia this will look less like a deterrent and more like a direct threat to their own sovereignty. Perfect Timing Assuming she wins, and there is good reason to believe that the polls will be rigged to ensure that she does, this will also coincide with Hillary Clinton assuming office. And as a mentor once remarked: thereâ€™s no such thing as coincidence. So the pieces are being put into place for an almighty clash between Russia and the West and the elite want Clinton to preside over it. Sheâ€™s already voiced her readiness to impose a no-fly zone over Syria , a move that could easily provoke a military clash between Russia and the West. Moreover such a confrontation wonâ€™t merely involve Russia and the West; Syria and Iran would also be involved as would China. In other words a win for Hillary could easily set the stage for a world war. Thatâ€™s what the elite want and thatâ€™s why we believe the U.S. presidential vote will be rigged in her favour. The warning signs are there to be seen. Tens of thousands of voting machines, which have been linked to George Soros and were used in a disputed election in Venezuela in 2004, are to be used in key states in the Nov 8 election. In addition surveys claiming Hillary a clear favourite have been called into question by the sheer numbers attending election rallies. While Donald Trump has been drawing capacity crowds Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign gatherings have been noticeably less well attended . There is moreover a wide disparity in pre-election opinion polls. Some are putting Trump ahead . While others are giving Clinton a double digit lead . Landing in Pennsylvania now. Great new poll this morning, thank you. Lets #DrainTheSwamp and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain ! TRUMP 42% 
â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2016 Call me a conspiracy theorist but such a wide discrepancy in campaign rally crowd numbers and survey findings suggests that the poll figures are being manipulated to create the illusion of support for Hillary. The elite have been trying to pull off a major global military clash for years. They tried it with Iran and its alleged nuclear weapons program. That failed after the Ayatollah proved himself to clever to fall into their trap. Now however, theyâ€™ve got Hillary Clinton to do their bidding as they prepare to position her as President of the United States. The warning signs are as clear as daylight. According to Secret Service agents charged with guarding Clinton, the woman is a nightmare to work for. Retired Secret Service agent Ronald Kessler writes: â€œWhen in public, Hillary smiles and acts graciouslyâ€. However, â€œAs soon as the cameras are gone, her angry personality, nastiness, and imperiousness become evident.â€ He adds: â€œHillary Clinton can make Richard Nixon look like Mahatma Gandhi.â€ I certainly hope that Iâ€™m wrong but weâ€™ll know soon enough.

20944,Henningsen: â€˜US Anti-Trump Protests Similar to Soros Color Revolutions Abroadâ€™,Mike Rivero,"21st Century Wire saysâ€¦ 
Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGOâ€™s to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this weekâ€™s US Presidential Election. 
On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this weekâ€™s unrest when he said : 
â€œIf Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNNâ€™s 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage.â€ 
On Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party â€˜community organizingâ€™ online platform MoveOn.org . Watch: 
. Not surprisingly, MoveOn.org have also launched a national â€˜activistâ€™ campaign to â€œ Abolish the Electoral College â€ after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came up short with 232 (including New Hampshire) to Donald Trumpâ€™s 306 (including Arizona and Michigan). Final totals are not yet in, but thus far 2016 would be the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate has won the White House while losing the total popular vote.

21WIRE Associate Editor Shawn Helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in CIA and Soros-funded â€˜color revolutionsâ€™ overseas â€“ are now being deployed on US domestic shores by similar NGO front organizations: has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump. 
â€œOverseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weekâ€™s protests,â€ says Helton. 
Helton also raised the question as to why President Obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests, opting instead to â€œlead from behind.â€ He explains: 
â€œCertainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clintonâ€™s total silence over their own partyâ€™s role in fomenting this weekâ€™s unrest â€“ one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable â€“ to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency.â€

20945,"Foreigners Have Long Mined Indonesia, but Now Thereâ€™s an Outcry - The New York Times",Jon Emont,"JAKARTA, Indonesia  â€”   Crowned with spiky feathered headdresses and daubed with face paint, scores of protesters gathered outside the Jakarta offices of an American mining giant last week, chanting, waving signs and throwing uncertainty into global commodities markets. The traditional garb was meant to make it clear whom they represented: the people of West Papua, site of  â€™s Grasberg mine  â€”   one of the worldâ€™s largest sources of gold and copper. Their shouted slogans made it equally clear what they wanted. â€œFreeport must be shut down!â€ the crowd chanted. It was a refrain that, in recent months, has resonated throughout Indonesia. Less than a week earlier, dozens of students from a different organization  â€”   dressed in red and white, Indonesiaâ€™s national colors  â€”   gathered outside the same office, calling for the government to take a firm hand with the company. â€œFreeport hasnâ€™t brought prosperity. Itâ€™s just destroyed the natural environment,â€ said Surya Anta, national coordinator for the Indonesian Peopleâ€™s Front for West Papua. His organization helped organize   protests in 17 cities around the country. Billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of metal is produced at the mighty Grasberg mine, which provides jobs in a province with few other prospects. The problem? The mine is  â€”   to the frustration of Indonesians watching their countryâ€™s economic growth begin to sputter as commodity prices sag  â€”   American owned and operated. To address that, the government has in recent years passed regulations intended to exert greater control over mine operators. Freeport says those requirements violate the companyâ€™s 1991 contract, which lasts until 2021 and which it wants to renew. The dispute has put the brakes on production at the mine and slammed Freeport directly into Indonesian politics. The company, which counts as a major investor the billionaire Carl Icahn, a major backer of President Trump, has brought it to the attention of the United States government. â€œIt is disingenuous and insulting that Indonesia would violate a contract by hiding behind politically motivated laws that were enacted after the contract was signed,â€ Mr. Icahn said. Jakarta is already in the midst of a tough race for governor that has engulfed the capital in demonstrations against Gov. Basuki Purnama, an ally of President Joko Widodo. Considered   Mr. Joko faces pressure to push back against an unpopular company at a time of declining exports, relatively slow economic growth and high political tension. The contract fight exemplifies Indonesiaâ€™s often fraught transition from a country exploited by colonial powers to one with the political clout to control its own resources, which are worth billions of dollars. For many Indonesians, Freeport, the biggest mining operation here, puts a face on that struggle. â€œWe are hoping that if Freeport is nationalized, the revenue from Freeport will be distributed to ordinary people, to subsidize basic needs and education,â€ said Ahmad Hedar, a student activist. Freeport has operated Grasberg since the early 1970s, the crown jewel in what a former chief executive called its global â€œtrove of treasures. â€ Indonesia, however, sees the mine as a national resource whose riches are being spirited away to foreign owners. â€œFreeport pays only 8 trillion rupiah in taxes,â€ but complains about unfair treatment, Ignasius Jonan, the minister of energy and natural resources, told the youth wing of a prominent Muslim organization in February. That figure, about $600 million, compares with about $3. 1 billion worth of gold and copper mined in 2015. But the company says that from 1992 to 2015, about 60 percent of its profit was returned to Indonesia in taxes, royalties, fees and stock dividends. Both sides have threatened to take the contract disagreement to international arbitration. Until the dispute is resolved, the Grasberg mine will run at about 40 percent capacity without a licensing deal, the Indonesian government will not allow Freeport to export unprocessed minerals. The price of copper has been stable since a sharp rise in November, but the companyâ€™s shares have dropped nearly 20 percent in the last two months. â€œIt is in the best interests of all stakeholders to receive a resolution in these matters,â€ Richard Adkerson, the chief executive of Freeport, said in a written statement to The New York Times. The Indonesian government faces extraordinary pressure from its citizens and national media to be firm with Freeport. This is driven by a perception that the company has consistently taken advantage of the Indonesian government since it entered the country in 1967 as one of its first big foreign investors. That year, Indonesiaâ€™s strongman leader, Suharto, granted Freeport a   tax holiday, as well as a reprieve from paying royalties, though Indonesiaâ€™s terms improved over the decades as the countryâ€™s economy developed. Some Indonesian media reports have called Freeport a â€œmonumentâ€ to the Suharto era. â€œIndonesians have always been educated that they have   resources that are the envy of the entire world, but that over the years Western colonial powers have hatched schemes to take over Indonesia to exploit those resources,â€ said Matthew Busch, a research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy. Indonesiaâ€™s largest Muslim civic organizations have aggressively opposed foreign control over the countryâ€™s resources, including calling for a â€œconstitutional jihadâ€ to challenge Indonesian laws that allow foreign companies to control domestic resources. The resulting friction has made Indonesia one of the worldâ€™s least attractive mining investment environments, according to the Fraser Institute, a Canadian research organization, which ranked it the 99th most difficult out of 104 nations, states and regions in 2016. Eve Warburton, a researcher at Australian National University who studies Indonesian resource nationalism, said that over the last decade Indonesian politicians had consistently been more assertive toward foreign mining companies. â€œNow it seems many people in government believe that Indonesia can afford to stay the nationalist path in the resources sectors,â€ she said. The conditions may be scaring off business. Last year Newmont, an American miner, sold its stake in Indonesiaâ€™s Batu Hijau copper mine after struggling to adjust to Indonesian regulations. Rio Tinto, the   company, has a deal to develop Grasberg with Freeport, but its chief executive suggested in February that the company might back out over the new rules. International analysts say Freeportâ€™s contract might not be as   as many Indonesian government officials make it out to be. And despite the uncompromising statements from both sides, they say, a deal remains in reach. â€œI see this as smoke and mirrors,â€ said Bill Sullivan, a lawyer and mining analyst in Jakarta. â€œThe government has no incentive whatsoever to make things so difficult for metal mineral producers that they wonâ€™t reach an agreement. Because of the governmentâ€™s need for deep political cover, however, it has to relax the export ban in a way that does not make it look as though the government is caving in to metal mineral producers. â€ Papua Province, where the Grasberg mine is, is Indonesiaâ€™s most restive and least developed, with a small independence movement that clashes with the military. Freeport pays about $20 million annually to the Indonesian government for security, including payments to Indonesiaâ€™s military, which has been linked to human rights abuses in the province. The payments have periodically drawn the scrutiny of human rights organizations as well as pension funds that invest in the company. But with Vice President Mike Pence scheduled to visit Indonesia in April, politicians here are unconcerned about effects on international relations. â€œIâ€™m someone who is very happy with Donald Trumpâ€™s brilliant ideas and was glad to see him elected president,â€ said Mukhtar Tompo, an Indonesian legislator who has called for Freeport to be expelled from Indonesia. â€œAs long as Donald Trump looks at things from every perspective, he will agree with our side. â€"

20947,Nuclear Reactor in Norway Leaks Radioactive Iodine,admin,"Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 
One of Norwayâ€™s nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] 
In a statement released today, the NRPA said: 
â€œThe radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.â€ 
Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. 
Said Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: 
â€œOf course itâ€™s an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.â€ [2] 
The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. 
Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. 
A senior NRPA official said the incident would â€œmaybeâ€ be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. [3] Source: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: 
â€œI donâ€™t sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasnâ€™t reported â€” it wasnâ€™t good enough that we didnâ€™t report it yesterday.â€ [2] 
Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulatorâ€™s frustration. 
â€œWe need to gather more information â€¦ But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.â€ [3] 
The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. 
Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. 
The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

20948,Earthquake Leaves a Trail of Destruction in Ecuador - The New York Times,Maggy Ayala and Kirk Semple,"PORTOVIEJO, Ecuador  â€”   The rumbling had ended and the rubble had settled, and Manuel Zambrano, 21, took stock of his situation: Somehow, he was alive. Moments earlier, he had been at his job in a pharmacy on the ground floor of a   building. Suddenly, the building began to shake and finally collapsed around him. He found himself trapped in a pocket within the debris. It was dark. He heard sirens, shouts, crying. â€œI thought it was the end,â€ he recalled, standing near a mound of concrete and plaster that had once been the building. â€œBut I remembered the 33 trapped miners in the mine in Chile, and thought that if they could survive so many days, I could do it, too. â€ At least 410 people were reported killed and more than 2, 000 were injured in the 7.  earthquake that struck Ecuador this weekend, the biggest to hit the country in decades, leaving a stretch of ruin through provinces bordering the Pacific Coast. The tremors flattened buildings, fractured highways and knocked out electricity to much of the region. On Monday, residents were still digging through the rubble for survivors and victims, the government was scrambling to find shelter for thousands of people left homeless and rescue crews from around the world had begun arriving in this Andean nation to help. This city of nearly 300, 000, the provincial capital of ManabÃ­ Province, was hit particularly hard, with officials reporting more than 100 deaths and at least 370 buildings destroyed. Survivors described how the earthquake, from one moment to the next, turned a normal, placid Saturday night into a disaster zone. Mr. Zambrano said that when the earthquake began, he and a friend, Diana SuÃ¡rez, pressed themselves against a pillar for safety. He described it as â€œa scene that I could only imagine but never ever saw. â€ But two hours after the collapse, they heard knocks on the walls and people shouting. â€œA person I now consider my hero was searching for people to help and he found us,â€ Mr. Zambrano recalled. â€œHe opened a hole and went to find help to get us out. â€ Mr. Zambrano managed to escape with only scrapes on his arms, face and legs. â€œI am 21 years old, but beginning today Iâ€™m counting from 1 because I was reborn,â€ he said, tears in his eyes. â€œBelieve me, I was reborn. â€ Not everyone in the building was so fortunate. Four other occupants died in the collapse, including another pharmacy employee, Vicky ChÃ¡vez, 31. Her father, Carlos ChÃ¡vez, and a group of neighbors were still removing the rubble, piece by piece, on Monday morning to free her body. By early afternoon, they had taken her corpse away. The other three victims were a couple and their young son who had stopped by the pharmacy to buy some medicine, witnesses said. Rescuers who dug out their bodies from under the debris found the child and mother still holding each other. The office of President Rafael Correa reported that rescue crews were flying in from around Latin America as well as from Europe. Hundreds of aid workers from abroad were already in the disaster zone by Monday morning, with the largest contingents so far including 120 from Mexico, 80 from Spain and 49 from Chile, officials said. In some of the   areas, like sections of Portoviejo, the Ecuadorean military set up cordons to restrict traffic and to allow rescue personnel to work more easily. The authorities were also concerned about further collapses in the event of aftershocks. Indeed, at 1:30 p. m. local time Monday, a 4.  tremor registered here, sowing panic, including among the rescue workers, who feared that the vibrations might topple structures that had already been compromised by Saturdayâ€™s earthquake. On Monday evening, a Colombian rescue team pulled a man from the wreckage of the Hotel El Gato here. The man, Pablo Cordoba, 38, the administrator of the hotel, told the rescuers that there may be another person alive in the wreckage. Mr. Cordoba said that for more than half a day after the earthquake, he carried on a conversation with another person who was trapped elsewhere in the wreckage the two could hear but not see each other. The other victim had gone silent around noon on Monday, Mr. Cordoba said. The Colombian rescue team  â€”   using tools, hands and an excavator, and working in near total darkness  â€”   started pushing deeper into the debris hoping to find another survivor. Fabiola CarreÃ±o, 35, her clothes covered in dust and her face wrought with anxiety, spent Monday searching likely locations for her cousin Jenny CarreÃ±o, 24, and for Jennyâ€™s    daughter, Kiara Villafuerte. At one point on Monday afternoon, Ms. CarreÃ±o was unsuccessfully trying to convince soldiers at a blockade to let her pass so that she could search for her relatives in the wreckage of a collapsed building. She held a photo of her cousin in her hand. â€œWe have to look for them,â€ she insisted. â€œWe have to identify them, but they arenâ€™t letting us. â€ The soldiers were unmoved. â€œWe know that we arenâ€™t going to find them alive,â€ she said of her relatives. â€œBut we want to bury their bodies. â€ Meanwhile, the Ecuadorean military began distributing food rations around the affected region of the country, including water and cooking oil. Fausto Ortega, 58, rode for more than an hour on his bicycle around Portoviejo and into the cityâ€™s suburbs looking for some bread for his familyâ€™s breakfast on Monday. â€œThe situation is very anxious because we have to look for ways to survive during these next few days,â€ he said. â€œMy wife is scared to enter the house and prefers to sleep in the street because the house can fall. â€ â€œWe are poor and need help, but nobody has come to bring us even a glass of water or a grain of rice,â€ he continued. â€œWeâ€™ve been told to go to the shelter but weâ€™re not going to leave the little that we have unguarded. â€ The Spanish Red Cross, which is helping its counterpart in Ecuador, estimated that between 3, 000 and 5, 000 people were left homeless by the earthquake and would need temporary shelter, the group said in a statement. The United Nations refugee agency announced Monday that it was preparing an airlift to help those displaced by the earthquake. The first supply plane was being loaded in Copenhagen, the agencyâ€™s global logistics hub, with 900 tents, 15, 000 sleeping mats, kitchen sets and, mindful of the Zika virus threat, 18, 000   mosquito nets. â€œThe aim is to rapidly provide essential shelter and other aid material over the next days for some 40, 000 people  â€”   refugees, asylum seekers and locals alike  â€”   in   communities,â€ the agency said in a statement, adding that it had already sent emergency supplies by truck from its Ecuadorean warehouses to the worst affected areas. Ecuador has the largest refugee population of any country in Latin America, the agency said, having welcomed over 200, 000 Colombian migrants and others, many of whom live where the earthquake hit hardest. For one group of people living in ManabÃ­ Province, however, the earthquake turned out to be a fortuitous event. Amid the tremors on Saturday, a wall at the El Rodeo state prison fell down, giving prisoners an escape route. According to local news reports, about 180 inmates fled through the hole and into the night, though by Monday about 30 had been recaptured."
20949,"Refugees Discover 2 Americas: One That Hates, and One That Heals - The New York Times",Adeel Hassan,"DUNDALK, Md.  â€”   Raâ€™ad and Hutham Lalqaraghuli are no longer sure which America theyâ€™re a part of. Is it the hateful country they confronted a few weeks before the presidential election, when someone left a note at their door that said, â€œTerrorist Leave no one wants you hereâ€? Or is it the generous country of welcoming strangers who heard about their ordeal and showered them with gifts and cards with positive messages? The victory of   Donald J. Trump has intensified their whiplash. After a year in the Maryland suburbs, having arrived with their four children as refugees from Iraq, they find themselves comparing the threats they fled with those that might still emerge. They did not sleep on election night after watching television coverage of the results. They are â€œvery afraid and worried,â€ Mr. Lalqaraghuli said on Wednesday. â€œWe donâ€™t know what this will mean. â€ Their confusion, and the divided response to the familyâ€™s presence here, mirrors the experience of many other refugee families and Muslim Americans. In the past week, even as advocates report a steep rise in attacks and acts of intimidation against blacks, Muslims and immigrants  â€”   and on women wearing hijabs  â€”   many of those episodes have been followed by public acts of support and solidarity. At Baylor University in Waco, Tex. hundreds of students and faculty members walked to class with Natasha Nkhama, a black student, after a friend posted a video of her describing an episode in which she was called a racial slur and forced off a sidewalk by someone who said, â€œIâ€™m just trying to make America great again. â€ In Georgia, Mairah Teli, a Muslim teacher at Dacula High School, posted a photograph of an anonymous note she received on Friday that said she should â€œtieâ€ her head scarf around her neck and â€œhang yourself with it. â€ A day later, she wrote in another Facebook post: â€œI am overwhelmed and deeply touched by all of the outcry and support that I have received in the past 24 hours. I canâ€™t even begin to articulate how touched I am to be receiving messages from all over the country with your support. â€ Acts of hate and intimidation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, occurred across the country during the campaign, and have increased significantly since Mr. Trump was declared the  . But the back and forth between acceptance and rejection can be particularly confusing for new arrivals like the Lalqaraghulis. Their new home of Dundalk is an   suburb of Baltimore, one of the many   communities where the nationâ€™s battles over identity have become most intense. It was once a lively hub of workers filing into plants for Bethlehem Steel, General Motors and other manufacturing giants. Now it is dominated by strip malls. Raâ€™ad Lalqaraghuli said he was initially eager to call it home. â€œWhen I arrived in America, I was so happy,â€ Mr. Lalqaraghuli, 43, said. â€œItâ€™s my dream country for my children. â€ Heâ€™d had experiences with Americans before. A graduate of Mosul University, in 2004 he began working as a group engineer for American contractors and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to help rebuild his country after the American invasion. A promotion to project manager in 2009 led to his overseeing the construction of water treatment plants and several schools in Baghdad and two cities south of the capital, Nasiriya and Basra. But his work for the Americans also brought him unwanted attention from terrorist groups. He spent one winter sleeping outside in the forest, to keep himself hidden, while his wife and children stayed with her family. Militants from the Islamic State abducted two of his younger brothers and one older brother instead. â€œThey said, â€˜In exchange for you, weâ€™ll give them back. â€™â€ He and his father didnâ€™t believe them, and the three brothers were killed. His work on behalf of the United States government made him and his family eligible for humanitarian protection under special immigrant visas. Lawyers in New York supported his application, and he received approval quickly. Then, last year, a militia bombed the family home. â€œI lost everything,â€ Mr. Lalqaraghuli said. At the Baghdad airport, heading to the United States, he still worried that he was being followed. All he had was his plane ticket, his passport, $100, and his wife and four children. Betsy Fisher, the deputy policy director of the New   International Refugee Assistance Project, which resettled the family, said she was dismayed to learn of its newfound anxiety, especially after the many attempts on Mr. Lalqaraghuliâ€™s life for several years by different groups in Iraq. â€œThe people who enter this country as refugees are fleeing from terrorism,â€ she said. â€œThey cannot live in a place with violence. â€ She added of the message posted on the familyâ€™s door, â€œNot only is a note like this horrifying, it should be deeply embarrassing for every American that this family was threatened, because the reason they are in this country is because he was of service to our country. â€ Advocates  â€”   like the Council on   Relations, which is helping the family  â€”   say that many refugee families are reluctant to come forward when they become victims of hate crimes because they fear a greater backlash. But after the note appeared  â€”   with a crude drawing of a woman in a hijab  â€”   Mr. Lalqaraghuli notified the police, telling an officer in the neighborhood who happened to be on a foot patrol near his apartment. The police said that the note had been written by a    neighbor, and that officers had talked to her and her parents but determined that no crime had been committed. The neighborâ€™s family did not respond to a message requesting comment. Criminal or not, the episode was enough to stir up a response  â€”   an effort to counter intolerance. Alta Haywood, a retired teacher who lives in Perry Hall, Md. sent the family a towering fruit basket and included a note that read in part, â€œI sincerely hope that other people in the area show you that they can be kind and accepting. â€ Another   Dr. Lindsay Fitch, said the news of what had happened to the family â€œjust grabbed me more personally. â€ While talking to her two children about it, she said, she decided to send the family the most American of welcomes: a   apple pie and a pumpkin pie. Included in her card were a photograph of her family and an invitation to have their families get together. â€œI wanted to welcome you to the Baltimore area,â€ she wrote. â€œThere are a lot of people here who want to welcome you with open arms. Hopefully, youâ€™ll find that welcome. Remember us when you encounter ugliness. â€ Mr. Lalqaraghuli, who works as a driver, said he greatly appreciated the outpouring of support. But after Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory, he said, it is hard to trust that acceptance will emerge as the countryâ€™s dominant force. He missed two weeks of work after the note was left, because, he said, his children felt safer when he was around. His youngest, Abdullah, 5, no longer sleeps in his own room. He joins his parents instead. â€œBecause he sees when militias come to my home, they come with the weapons,â€ Mr. Lalqaraghuli said. He was referring to their life in Baghdad. But as soon as possible, he said, his family will be looking to move out of Dundalk and start fresh in another town or state."
20950,Snapchat Shares Plummet After Grown-Ups Figure Out How to Use It,Guest,"November 10, 2016 
Snapchat, the final evolutionary stage before society gives up on sentences altogether and we start communicating in a series of emotive grunts, has seen a steep fall in share prices after proper adults figure out how to use the application successfully. Observers have described the phenomenon, â€˜Abnormalâ€™, â€˜Chillingâ€™ and â€˜Like watching a dog doing the hoovering â€“ not something that should be in a sane world.â€™ 
The photographic bants-platform first believed adult use of Snapchat was an anomaly caused by over-protective parents rooting through their teenagerâ€™s belongings in search for evidence of pre-marital sex and â€˜The Reeferâ€™. However, pattern analysis of messages suggests the missives were sent intentionally as part of a deliberate campaign to be seen as, â€˜Not hurtling inexorably towards the graveâ€™. Company bosses are reported to be, â€˜Guttedâ€™. 
â€˜Itâ€™s a death knellâ€™ said CEO Michaela Hodgkinson. â€˜This will just about wipe out our user base. And we tried so hard. We made it so counter-intuitive to people who didnâ€™t grow up with access to enough pixilated tits and ass to wrap multiple times round the Milky Way like an erotic flesh sausage. God, I wish it were the good old days, when adults treated innovation with the sort of suspicion usually reserved for men called â€˜Mohammedâ€™ walking into a small town Texan airport.â€™ 
â€˜It is a well-known fact that adolescents instinctively recoil from in shame, disgust and loathing to anything enjoyed by the over 30â€™s,â€™ explained youth-guru Samuel Cook. â€˜Look at Michael Bolton. Once upon a time, the mere Herbal-Essence-esque swoosh of his flowing easy-listening locks could obliterate juvenile knickers like the oncoming of a Biblical flood; now, Iâ€™ve seen a teenager to projectile vomit the words, â€˜Cock-nuggetâ€™ just by hearing the opening bars to â€˜When A Man Loves A Womanâ€™. 
Experts suggest that teenagersâ€™ influence over what is cool acts as compensation for a future without the possibility of jobs, savings, or affordable housing, at least until their parents pop their clogs and they can wrench a decent standard of living out of their elderâ€™s hoary baby-boomer claws. Teenagers are expected to flee the social media site like rats aboard a sinking over-60s cruise ship and seek pastures even more disorientating and obtuse. Prospective new digital street-corners-outside-the-offie include, â€˜Blusterâ€™, â€˜Waffleâ€™ and a messaging service where users communicate entirely using quotes from the 1988 film Beetlejuice.

20951,Police Drag Anti-Mass Migration Campaigner off Streets for Asking Anti-Islamophobia Protestors Questions,Jack Montgomery,"  immigration campaigner Tommy Robinson was verbally and physically abused by demonstrators on a   march on Saturday, after approaching them and attempting to engage in conversation. Police detained him and ordered him off the streets, saying this was â€œeasierâ€ than â€œtaking onâ€ the aggressive protestors.[  activist Tommy Robinson was joined by Rebel Media reporter Caolan Robertson, approaching demonstrators to ask their views on issues such as female genital mutilation and sexual grooming.  Within five minutes of arriving at the protest, according to Robertson, the pair were surrounded by people shouting â€œNazi, white supremacist!â€ resulting in attending police officers detaining Robinson. Footage shows Robinson approaching a man screaming â€œNazi scum!â€ and asking for him to explain why he is a Nazi. A policewoman quickly removes Robinson from the scene, asking him to â€œrespect that these people donâ€™t want to talk to youâ€. A subsequent attempt by Robinson to engage a student protestor about her views on Islam is terminated by an aggressive older male, who pushes him away shouting: â€œWe donâ€™t want a Nazi on this demo. Get off!â€ Robinson tries to mollify the man by explaining that he is just trying to have a â€œpolite conversationâ€ but the male begins screaming about losing family in the Holocaust and whips up unruly chants of â€œNazi scum, off our streets!â€ It is at this point that Robinson is dragged away by the police, who attempt to separate him from Robertson and his camera. When Robinson asks why he is the one being manhandled when it is the demonstrators who are being aggressive, a female officer explains bluntly that â€œitâ€™s easier to remove youâ€ than to â€œtake onâ€ the angry crowd. She also claims Robinson is the one causing the violence â€œby his sheer presenceâ€. Footage shot at another point on the march shows Robinson attempting to ask demonstrators their view on the oppression of women under Shariah, and being told â€œYouâ€™re a racistâ€ repeatedly. â€œIs that all youâ€™ve got?â€ Robinson finally asks. â€œYes it is!â€ the demonstrator replies. Elsewhere, a protestor tells Robinson she is on the march because it feels as though years of   leislation has been for nothing. â€œWhat if I told you that, statistically, white people are the biggest victims of racism in the UK?â€ Robinson asks. â€œWhite people canâ€™t be victims of racism,â€ she scoffs. In fact, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) found that most victims of racism in England and Wales were white as long ago as 1999, in a report titled â€œRacial Attacks and Harassmentâ€. Scottish statistics published in 2015 show that â€œWhite Britonsâ€ are also the most common victims of race hate crimes north of the border. Scotlandâ€™s first ever   murder victim was a white schoolboy named Kriss Donald, who was kidnapped, stabbed 13 times, and burned alive by a Pakistani gang in an unprovoked attack in 2004. Finally, a figure Robinson identified as Unite Against Fascism leader Raymond Bennett begins abusing Robinson and has the police remove him a second time. â€œThey donâ€™t want to debate their issues because theyâ€™re so blinkered, so fascist,â€ Robinson tells Robertson. â€œThese peopleâ€™s views have never been challenged   â€¦     theyâ€™ve been indoctrinated. â€  "
20952,Fox Settles With Gretchen Carlson Over Roger Ailes Sex Harassment Claims - The New York Times,Michael M. Grynbaum and John Koblin,"Fox Newsâ€™s parent company spent $20 million on Tuesday to settle a lawsuit brought by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, whose allegations of sexual harassment toppled the networkâ€™s powerful chairman, Roger Ailes, and engulfed the company in crisis. But if the settlement was meant to signal the close of a damaging chapter for the network, it fell short. Foxâ€™s newsroom was hit minutes later by a new shock wave: Greta Van Susteren, one of the channelâ€™s   and   hosts, was leaving, effective immediately. Network officials insisted that the timing was coincidental. But the settlement, combined with Ms. Van Susterenâ€™s abrupt departure, underscored the continuing tumult inside Fox News, whose newsroom, once proudly defiant, has been besieged this summer by new allegations of harassment and persistent rumors about turnover in the   and executive ranks. These days, it seems, the end of one Fox drama is only the start of another. Stars like Megyn Kelly and Bill Oâ€™Reilly have contracts that expire next year, and Ms. Van Susterenâ€™s exit on Tuesday was taken as an unsettling sign of change. It is unclear whether Fox News, without Mr. Ailes at the helm, can maintain its political clout in a disruptive election season. The uproar is somewhat puzzling for Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, who control Fox Newsâ€™s owner, 21st Century Fox. They say they have taken extraordinary steps to address problems at the network, which is still the   cable news network in the country, beginning with their swift removal of Mr. Ailes. Specialists in employment law described the $20 million payout to Ms. Carlson  â€”   a figure confirmed by a person briefed on the agreement  â€”   as among the   settlements for a   sexual harassment suit. (Mr. Ailes, who received $40 million from Fox as part of his exit agreement, is not paying any portion of the settlement.) Fox has also settled with at least two other women who came forward with complaints about Mr. Ailes, the person said. And the company issued a rare public apology to Ms. Carlson, â€œfor the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve. â€ But tensions remain among the network   . Mr. Murdoch, who now presides over Fox News as executive chairman, kept in place several of Mr. Ailesâ€™s most loyal deputies and recently promoted them to leadership roles, troubling employees who had hoped for a clean slate. The reasons behind Ms. Van Susterenâ€™s departure remained murky, but people on both sides of the negotiations pointed to an icy meeting in July between Ms. Van Susteren and Rupert Murdoch as a turning point in her tenure. Days after Mr. Ailesâ€™s exit, Ms. Van Susteren met with Mr. Murdoch in his   office inside Foxâ€™s Manhattan headquarters. The anchor, accompanied by her husband and agent, John P. Coale, requested more favorable terms to her contract  â€”   which was not immediately up for renewal  â€”   and cited an exit clause that allowed her to leave the network in the event that Mr. Ailes was no longer chairman. Mr. Murdoch was not impressed, both sides say. â€œIt was tense,â€ Mr. Coale recalled in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Late last week, Ms. Van Susteren informed Fox that she planned to invoke her exit clause. But she woke up on Tuesday fully expecting to tape her   show, â€œOn the Record,â€ that evening. Instead, Mr. Coale said, â€œsomeone came to our house and delivered two lettersâ€ from the network. The message: â€œSheâ€™s out. â€ It was so abrupt that a   poster of Ms. Van Susteren, who routinely beat the cable competition in her 7 p. m. time slot, was still displayed outside Foxâ€™s Manhattan building when the announcement went out. (The poster was removed later on Tuesday.) Inside the channelâ€™s Washington bureau, newspapers sat untouched outside Ms. Van Susterenâ€™s   office. Ms. Van Susteren had initially defended Mr. Ailes, calling Ms. Carlson â€œdisgruntledâ€ and saying that the timing of her lawsuit â€œis very suspicious. â€ But on Tuesday, in a farewell post on Facebook, Ms. Van Susteren wrote: â€œFox has not felt like home to me for a few years. â€ Mr. Coale, in the interview, echoed that sentiment. â€œThereâ€™s so much chaosâ€ at Fox, he said. â€œItâ€™s very hard to work there. â€ Asked why his wife had exercised the exit clause, Mr. Coale said, â€œThereâ€™s more than meets the eye,â€ adding that there â€œmight be litigation in the future. â€ But he provided no further details. Ms. Van Susteren, on Facebook, wrote that she had to leave the network now because of a time limit on her exit clause. Brit Hume, a veteran Fox political anchor, took over hosting duties for Ms. Van Susterenâ€™s show on Tuesday and is expected to continue through the election. â€œI count Greta a friend and Iâ€™m sorry to see her go,â€ Mr. Hume said at the conclusion of Tuesdayâ€™s broadcast. Although she has been a Fox fixture since 2002, Ms. Van Susteren does not command the same star power as Ms. Kelly or Mr. Oâ€™Reilly. Fox News executives on Tuesday dismissed the notion that her departure signaled tough times ahead, noting that the channel has scored record ratings this year. â€œFox News has never been stronger,â€ the networkâ€™s   Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine, said in a statement. Ms. Van Susterenâ€™s exit was viewed by Fox officials as a less consequential development than the companyâ€™s settlement with Ms. Carlson, whose suit initially faced a legal challenge from Mr. Ailes. The evidence that Ms. Carlson had against Mr. Ailes was damning, according to another person with knowledge of the settlement: For a year and a half, she had recorded her meetings with Mr. Ailes on her mobile phone. (In an interview with The New York Times in July, Ms. Carlson said she recalled â€œbetween six and 10â€ conversations with Mr. Ailes when the chairman made provocative comments.) Most of the remarks that she attributed to Mr. Ailes in her lawsuit  â€”   including lines like, â€œI think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then youâ€™d be good and better and Iâ€™d be good and betterâ€  â€”   were taken straight from those recordings, the person said. Officials at 21st Century Fox became aware of the recordings about three weeks after Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit, the person said, after Ms. Carlsonâ€™s lawyers spoke to investigators from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison, the law firm hired to look into the accusations against Mr. Ailes. (About 20 women at Fox have come forward during the firmâ€™s inquiry to describe inappropriate behavior by Mr. Ailes.) Settlement talks started shortly thereafter, and a deal was reached in   the person said. Ms. Carlson sued Mr. Ailes alone, but 21st Century Fox, which acts as Mr. Ailesâ€™s corporate indemnifier, will pay the settlement. As part of the arrangement, which was first reported on Tuesday by Vanity Fair, Ms. Carlson signed a confidentiality agreement. In a sign that Ms. Carlson is not going to shrink from the spotlight, she recently hired the power publicist Cindi Berger of PMK BNC to represent her. She issued a statement on Tuesday saying she was â€œready to move on to the next chapter of my life, in which I will redouble my efforts to empower women in the workplace. â€"
20953,Obamacare Architect Says Itâ€™s Working As Designed!,Michael Ware,"Print 
Many look at the new healthcare system with their higher premiums and wonder what has happened. Why are their coverages shrinking and their premiums growing? Some have come to the conclusion that the system itself is to blame. They believe that Obamacare is broken? 
What they fail to recognize is that this is not the case at all. What we see as failing to make insurance better has made it worse, but it is simply a problem of ignorance. We just are not smart enough to know the truth. Higher premiums and less coverage is the point, it seems. 
Breitbart reports : 
On Wednesdayâ€™s broadcast of â€œCNN Newsroom,â€ MIT Economics Professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber argued that â€œThe law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty.â€ 
Gruber said, â€œObamacareâ€™s not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which weâ€™ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.â€ 
So basically, everything that is being reported is not accurate. There is no reason to think that all of the insurers are bailing like rats on a sinking ship. It just appears that way. This is little more that foolâ€™s hope so that there will not be a mass exit from the exchange. 
But, unfortunately, people no longer demand proof. They simply take a man like this at his word. So, he will get away with telling Chicken Little that the sky is not falling; even while it is coming down on his head. 
When you chase emptiness, God will let you catch it.

Good evening. Hereâ€™s the latest. 1. The official theme for the first day of the Republican National Convention was â€œMake America Safe Again,â€ but infighting and protests were undercurrents. Tonightâ€™s   speakers included Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and Donald Trumpâ€™s wife, Melania. Mr. Trump introduced her, walking on stage to Queenâ€™s â€œWe Are the Championsâ€ and telling the crowd: â€œOh weâ€™re gonna win, weâ€™re gonna win so big. â€ Our live coverage is here. The New Yorker published an article in which Mr. Trumpâ€™s ghostwriter on â€œThe Art of the Dealâ€ confesses to â€œa deep sense of remorseâ€ for portraying Mr. Trump positively. â€œLying is second nature to him,â€ the author said. _____ 2. Louisiana officials detailed how an     killed three police officers and wounded three more in Baton Rouge, saying he deliberately targeted them. In a range of digital postings, sometimes under another name, the gunman complained that â€œdevilsâ€ ran the world and advocated a bloody response to recent fatal shootings by the police. â€œOne hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,â€ he said in one clip, â€œhave been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. â€ _____ 3. Hillary Clinton, speaking at an N. A. A. C. P. convention in Cincinnati, denounced the attacks on police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas, as well as police shootings that killed two black men this month. â€œThis madness has to stop,â€ she said. An analysis of dozens of recent state and national polls of voters shows that Mrs. Clinton holds a modest but clear lead over Mr. Trump. _____ 4. Leading antidoping officials urged that Russia be barred from the Summer Olympics in Rio after an independent inquiry confirmed a Russian  â€™s claims of   doping. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said officials implicated in the report would be â€œtemporarily suspended,â€ but criticized â€œa dangerous relapse of politics intruding into sports. â€ The International Olympic Committee called an emergency meeting for Tuesday. _____ 5. One of our   stories today is a meditation on clutter from a different perspective: someone who simply couldnâ€™t afford much stuff. A woman remembers the years when poverty mandated a â€œminimalistâ€ lifestyle so popular now among the middle class. â€œFor people who are not so well off,â€ she notes, â€œthe idea of opting to have even less is not really an option. â€ _____ 6. Facing reports that Roger Ailes would soon be removed as chairman of Fox News, 21st Century Fox insisted that â€œthis matter is not yet resolved. â€ Mr. Ailes is being sued for sexual harassment by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson. _____ 7. Turkeyâ€™s government fired nearly 9, 000 police officers, widening its vast purge of perceived opponents after a failed military coup. Above, a funeral for a police officer killed in clashes. Over the weekend, 6, 000 military personnel were arrested and 3, 000 judges suspended. Secretary of State John Kerry and the European Unionâ€™s top diplomat urged President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to show restraint, even suggesting Turkeyâ€™s membership in NATO and candidacy for the E. U. could be compromised. _____ 8. Political tensions in France are spiking, as   opposition politicians assailed the Socialist government over Thursdayâ€™s terrorist attack in Nice. Jeers and calls for the French prime minister to resign fractured a moment of silence he attended in Nice, called to honor the 84 people killed there by a rampaging truck driver. Above, the gathering. New details emerged about the attacker: he was not an observant Muslim but had been recently searching for Islamist material and had collected images of Islamic State and other terrorist figures. _____ 9. A celebrity feud flared anew. Kanye Westâ€™s wife, Kim Kardashian West, posted clips of a phone conversation that appeared to counter Taylor Swiftâ€™s insistence that she was blindsided by lyrics in one of Mr. Westâ€™s songs. In the clips, Ms. Swift thanks him for running the line â€œI feel like me and Taylor might still have sexâ€ by her, and he responds, â€œRelationships are more important than punch lines. â€ _____ 10.

20955,"The Products that Make Men Grow Breasts, Linked to Cancers of the Prostate and Liver",REALdeal,"Owned by Unilever, the Axe brand includes a range of menâ€™s grooming products with many of the ingredients never even tested for safety according to the C.I.R. â€“ Cosmetic Ingredient Review. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals 
Axe products are loaded with endocrine disrupting chemicals. Endocrine disruptorsare exogenous, synthetic chemicals that have hormone-like effects on both humans and wild-life and interfere with the endocrine system by either mimicking or blocking our natural hormones and disrupting their respective body functions. Member scientists of the Endocrine Society issued a report in which they claim: 
â€œWe present the evidence that endocrine disruptors have effects on male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostrate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology.â€ 
New studies are also revealing that these harmful chemicals may be causing physical feminization in males. A study published by the International Journal of Andrology found that feminization of boys can now be seen through their play habits. 
Medical experts are now wondering whether exposure to years of these toxic chemicals is part of the reason so many older men are low on testosterone and experiencing erectile dysfunction. So they take a little blue pill and get exposed to even more chemicals and the cycle continues. Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 
Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly is the active ingredient in Axe deodorant products. One or more animal studies show kidney or renal system effects at very low doses, mammalian cells show positive mutation results, animal studies show reproductive effects at moderate doses. 
Aluminum was first recognized as a human neurotoxin in 1886, before being used as an antiperspirant. A neurotoxin is a substance that causes damage to nerves or nerve tissue. 
COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE 
COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE is a very toxic ingredient which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. The biggest danger of using a product with cocamidopropyl betaine is its potential contamination with nitrosamines . 
Nitrosamines are created when nitrosating agents are combined with amines. Nitrosamines have been identified as one of the most potent classes of carcinogens, having caused cancer in more than 40 different animal species as well as in humans. PPG-14 Butyl Ether 
PPG stands for popypropylene glycol, which is made from a completely artificial petroleum product, methyl oxirane. Another name for that is propylene oxide (which is a probable human carcinogen). Propylene oxide is also an irritant and highly flammable. Butyl ethers are in the paraben family, and they are toluene derivatives (toxic petrochemical compounds). Toluene has proven to have a harmful affect on the reproductive system while parabens have been linked to cancer. 
PEG-8 Distearate 
According to a report in the International Journal of Toxicology by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) committee, impurities found in various PEG compounds include ethylene oxide; 1,4-dioxane; polycyclic aromatic compounds; and heavy metals such as lead, iron, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic. Many of these impurities are linked to cancer. BHT 
There have been many studies which demonstrate that BHT accumulates over time in the body, having a toxic impact on the lungs, liver and kidneys amongst other negative effects. A study by Gann in 1984 showed that BHT was capable of promoting chemically-induced forestomach and bladder cancer in male rats. 
A 1988 Swedish study by Thompson looked at both BHT and BHA. They found that both were toxic and tumour promoting. Both antioxidants were observed to be cytotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 100 to 750 microM. At equimolar concentrations BHT was more cytotoxic than BHA."
20956,Police Report: Migrant Crime Drastically Increased in 2016,Chris Tomlinson,"The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has released a new report which claims that crimes committed by migrants rapidly increased in 2016 compared to the previous year. [The new report from the BKA states that in 2016 there was a total of 295, 000 crimes that involved immigrants as suspects, up 90, 000 from 2015 when there were 205, 000. The police say that the crimes counted did not include migrant specific crimes like illegal entry into Germany or staying in the country illegally Die Welt reports.  The three most cited crimes that involved immigrants were counterfeiting which accounted for 29 percent of all the crimes, theft at 26 percent, and violence including bodily harm at 24 percent. The BKA said there were 450 cases in which migrants had attempted to kill another person, with 66 murder suspects and a total of 82 victims. The twelve victims of the Berlin Christmas market terror attack in December committed by Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri were also counted in the statistics. In   of the cases of attempted murder or homicide, the victims were immigrants themselves with 59 victims coming from migrant backgrounds while other victims included five EU citizens, two   citizens and 16 German nationals. Breitbart London has reported on several cases, primarily in and around asylum homes, in which migrant men have beaten and sometimes even murdered family members such as their own wives. The BKA defines â€œimmigrantsâ€ in the report as anyone who is either an asylum seeker, a person with refugee status, an illegal immigrant or failed asylum seekers who are allowed to stay in the country. A spokeswoman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said that the government was working on a full report that will also include criminal statistics from the regional governments as well. Several regions in Germany have already released migrant crime statistics and all have shown a drastic rise in migrant crime. In Munich police have noted that almost half of the criminal suspects in the Bavarian city are â€œ . â€ In the German capital of Berlin, the senate has launched a formal inquiry into why migrant crime rates are so high in the city. The Berlin crime statistics showed that 13 percent of the migrant population in the city were suspects in various crimes, compared to the German population in which only 6 percent were suspects in crimes.   and Bavaria have both expressed concerns with the growing migrant crime trend. Last month   State Criminal Police Office (LKA) president Ralf Michelfelder said, â€œwe are very worried about the rise in violence by asylum seekers. â€  Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com,      "
20957,Universe is a hologram/virtual reality - But why? Could it be this?,Biigs,"link Okay, we are all familiar with the theory that our universe is some sort of simulation, math that works so specifically, so well, so many predictions from math and science that are proved right more and more often etc and so on. (not going to get into ""proof"" google it!) So you have to ask yourself WHY would a thing, being, God, whatever want to create such a virtual simulation? We know that we as humans have the right to live and have family's, often with as many kids as sustainable (at the time). This means that however well we create food, we WILL use up all resources on this planet weather we make the best plans or not. But we cant crack viable ways to leave this planet and populate others beyond our own slowly decaying star. So what about this. What if the answer was to create a sped up reality, using all our computing and programming powers to emulate the universe (or observable universe), wait for life to grow on a planet and then give them the same problem we have so that we can reap the answer for ourselves? LEAVING THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO COLONISE OTHER SYSTEMS, INDEFINITELY. Could it be as simple as that? Love to hear your thoughts, been thinking about this for some time now."

He is trying to get her to question her sense of reality, to think her mind is playing tricks on her  â€”   in short, to convince her that she is going slightly crazy, a tactic that can be scarily effective. Trumpâ€™s compulsive lies are a   fact of the campaign at this point, but I still questioned my own reality for a moment on Monday night whenever he fudged the truth  â€”   as when he implied that by saying Hillary Clinton did not have the presidential look, he meant she did not have the â€œstaminaâ€ (this is a lot like his saying that when he insulted Carly Fiorinaâ€™s face, he really meant her â€œpersonaâ€). Iâ€™d already seen a clip of him in which he goes after Clintonâ€™s lack of a presidential look, specifically  â€”   but even so, I had that normal human response, a bit of  .

20961,The Chronicles of Carlos Danger,No Author,"As the FBI assesses emails from former congressmanâ€™s devices, his sex scandal is once again making headlines. Joe Bidenâ€™s response: â€˜Oh, Godâ€™ By Oliver Milman The Guardian October 31, 2016 
As a fractious and often sordid presidential campaign reaches its denouement, Hillary Clinton may be reflecting upon the grim irony that it is Anthony Weiner who has provided what could be the final, miserable twist. 
Weinerâ€™s predilection for sending sexually laden text messages derailed his career in Congress and his chances of becoming mayor of New York City , but his soap-opera-style re-emergence in the 11th hour of the presidential race may yet trigger the greatest political carnage of all. 
His appearance comes in an election already defined by allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Clintonâ€™s husband, former president Bill Clinton, and by the Republican nominee, Donald Trump . 
On Friday, Clinton called on the FBI to â€œimmediatelyâ€ explain its announcement that it was reviewing a new batch of emails relating to her, after a review of her use of a private email server was closed in July. 
Then, the FBI director, James Comey, said Clinton had been â€œ extremely careless â€ in her use of a private server while secretary of state, but said there were no grounds for a criminal investigation. 
On Friday, he said in a letter to members of Congress that the bureau would analyze newly discovered emails that â€œappear to be pertinent to the investigationâ€. Republicans were quick to characterise the move as a â€œreopeningâ€ of the investigation into Clintonâ€™s server, a description Democrats rejected. 
It was later reported that the new emails came from an iPad, cellphone and laptop seized by the FBI and previously shared by Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. 
Clintonâ€™s campaign and the Obama administration have been left bewildered by the latest FBI intervention, less than two weeks before the election, with Weinerâ€™s involvement rubbing salt into the wound. 
John Podesta, Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, said: â€œDirector Comeyâ€™s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant. 
â€œIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.â€ 
Vice-president Joe Biden was more direct, telling CNNâ€™s Michael Smerconish in an interview broadcast on Saturday: â€œWell, oh God, Anthony Weiner. I should not comment on Anthony Weiner . Iâ€™m not a big fan. I wasnâ€™t before he got in trouble.â€ 
Weiner is being investigated by the FBI and police in North Carolina over text messages sent to a 15-year-old girl . In the wake of the latest allegations against him, Abedin, who has herself been a target for criticism from Republicans for some time, separated from Weiner . She has continued in her role as Clintonâ€™s closest ally on the campaign trail. 
Once seen as a rising Democratic star, Weiner was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 after he sent a picture of his penis, clad in his boxer shorts, to a 21-year-old student via Twitter. After he initially denied involvement in the messages, further pictures sent by Weiner emerged and he stepped down, at the urging of Barack Obama ."
20962,Total Desperation Sets In as President Obama Plays the Woman Card,Michael Krieger,"at 4:08 pm 1 Comment 
With the neither the racist nor the Putin-puppet label sticking to Trump, team Clinton and its lobotomized surrogates have regressed back to square one: playing the woman card . 
As I noted in a post earlier this week, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley just published an article at Time claiming (with zero evidence of course), that the Hillary Clinton email server scandal only exists because she is a woman. Hereâ€™s a brief snippet of what she said: 
â€˜Itâ€™s not about emails; itâ€™s about public communication by a womanâ€™ 
I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. Itâ€™s us. 
The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what sheâ€™s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. 
Itâ€™s not about emails; itâ€™s about public communication by a woman in general. Of course, in the year 2016, no one (probably not even The Donald) could make this argument explicitly. After all, he and his fellow Republicans are not waging a war on women. How do we know that? They have said so. And theyâ€™re men, so they must be telling the truth. 
I know. Itâ€™s really hard to believe the above is real, but it is. 
Moving along, President Obama himself is now getting in the mud. 
Hereâ€™s what he had to say today in Ohio, according to NBC : 
COLUMBUS, Ohio â€” President Barack Obama said Tuesday that sexism is to blame for the tight race for the White House, telling an Ohio crowd that â€œHillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there.â€ 
Obama went on: â€œThereâ€™s a reason we havenâ€™t had a woman president.â€ 
Speaking specifically to â€œthe guys out there,â€ Obama told them to â€œlook inside yourself and ask yourself, if youâ€™re having problems with this stuff how much of it is that weâ€™re just not used to it?â€ 
Yep, because the American public handily elected a black man twice, but somehow we all draw the line at a woman. Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem is with Hillary. 
Moving along, all this reminded me of a very prescient comment made by Glenn Greenwald a couple of years ago, which I highlighted in the post, Glenn Greenwald on the 2016 Elections â€“ â€œTheyâ€™ll Probably Have a Gay Person After Hillaryâ€ : 
Hillary is banal, corrupted, drained of vibrancy and passion. I mean, sheâ€™s been around forever, the Clinton circle. Sheâ€™s a fucking hawk and like a neocon, practically. Sheâ€™s surrounded by all these sleazy money types who are just corrupting everything everywhere. But sheâ€™s going to be the first female president, and women in America are going to be completely invested in her candidacy. Opposition to her is going to be depicted as misogynistic, like opposition to Obama has been depicted as racist. Itâ€™s going to be this completely symbolic messaging thatâ€™s going to overshadow the fact that sheâ€™ll do nothing but continue everything in pursuit of her own power. Theyâ€™ll probably have a gay person after Hillary whoâ€™s just going to do the same thing. 
Obama couldâ€™ve gone out on a high note, but he decided to go low. 
Sad!"
20963,Hacked emails reveal Hillary funded Trump campaign,K Balakumar,"Hacked emails reveal Hillary funded Trump campaign Posted on Tweet 
â€œHe is the only person who can help me win the presidential electionâ€ 
Washington, Nov 2 : Just as things were getting to the point where it cannot get any worse in the sleaziest American presidential campaign ever (unless otherwise it was revealed during the Halloween that Donald Trump is a real zombie), comes the potentially game-changing news that the Republican nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign has been, for the most part, funded by his fierce Democrat rival Hillary Clinton. 
These details emerged in a series of hacked e-mails of Hillary that she had stored in her â€˜pen driveâ€™. In one of the emails, Hillary writes to her campaign adviser John Podesta, â€œIt is now more than abundantly clear that the only person who can make me win in the election is Donald Trump.â€ She goes on to add, â€œBut we cannot sit idly hoping that he would do the job for us on his own. We must actively encourage his campaign. In other words, we must fully bankroll himâ€. 
Podesta, in his reply to the e-mail, concurs with Hillaryâ€™s line of thinking, â€œyeah, you have put it way better than we can.â€ In fact, he goes one step ahead and lays it all brutally down: â€œIt is only smart that we start funding his campaign before his camp gets all wise and starts funding our campaign. We donâ€™t want a Face/Off kind of situation here where one is the front of the other and vice-versa. As it is, it is difficult telling the two campaigns apartâ€. 
And as part of the carefully constructed plan, Hillaryâ€™s team allowed Russian hackers to not only hack her e-mails but also bank accounts, knowing fully well that the hacked mails and money would eventually find their way from the Russians to the Trump camp. 
At one point, Podesta does raise the question what if the Russians pass on only the mails and keep the money themselves. â€œDo you want to trust the Russians with all the money? Looks like a dangerous gambit. Iâ€™m red-flagging it here itselfâ€. 
But Hillary, who had worked out her strategy pretty smartly, replies Podesta: â€œWhen I say money, we are not going to put actual money that Russians would doubtless run away with.â€ She adds that the plan is to go the Sodexo coupon route. â€œWe put humongous amount of Sodexo coupons. Russians wouldnâ€™t know to use them and would pass it to Trumpâ€™s team. I am pretty sure they will lap it up, as I am even more pretty sure that Trump wouldnâ€™t have given lunch and dinner allowance to his teamâ€. 
Understandably, the latest e-mail reveals have caused further confusion in a campaign that has never been short of that. The Trump campaign managers lashed out Hillary and her team and accused them â€œof (metaphorically) sneaking into enemyâ€™s room and poisoning his drink and foodâ€. 
Trumpâ€™s spokesperson said â€œthey have used our hands to poke our eyes, which anyway we ourselves were doing. This reveals their desperation. But we arenâ€™t fazed. We will continue to do what we have been doing without anybodyâ€™s bidding.â€ 
Trump himself, in a speech to his supporters, thundered, â€œso you now get the real picture. All my gaffes, stupid remarks and silly antics have all been the fault of that woman. The ridiculous things that I say on a daily basis is all the work of Hillary.â€ 
He added: â€œThe crazy things I come up with at all meetings, the media has been there always. I know. I have seen them. Why did they not find out that it was all Hillaryâ€™s faultâ€. 
Trump also said that those claiming that I have not paid my taxes have a clear answer now. â€œHow can I pay taxes for Hillaryâ€™s money?â€ 
Trumpâ€™s parting words were: â€œHillary and her conspiracies are a conspiracy of China. She could be the effect of global warmingâ€. 
Meanwhile, the Hillary campaign team responded to the allegations by saying, â€œit is more than a real possibility that the Trumpâ€™s team might be using Hillary Clintonâ€™s body double to create her emails and money accounts.â€ 
Hillaryâ€™s aide, in a non-hacked e-mail response, said, â€œTrump campaign team is financing Hillaryâ€™s body double and funding themselves. It doesnâ€™t take much to figure this out. It is not rocket science. Just do your math.â€ 
The aide added: â€œWe have also reasons to believe that the Trump campaign team is using a Trump body double to address his meetings so that they will have less embarrassment to manage laterâ€. 
Elsewhere, in a totally understandable development, a latest media poll suggested that 100 per cent of Americans would prefer Hillaryâ€™s body double to Hillary and Trumpâ€™s body double to Trump. â€œThe body doubles are assured of a landslide victoryâ€, revealed the poll."
20964,Manchester Suicide Bomber Salman Abedi: Son of Libyan Immigrants Who Chanted Arabic Prayers in The Street,Adam Shaw,"Salman Abedi, the suicide bomber responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing Monday night which left 22 people dead and dozens injured, was reportedly the son of Libyan immigrants and was apparently radicalised while living in one of the countryâ€™s most heavily Muslim areas  â€”   an area that had   problems before. [Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins identified Abedi Tuesday as the man who detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert as   left the arena.  Multiple outlets, including The New York Times and the Daily Telegraph, reported that Abedi was born in 1994 in Manchester and was of Libyan descent.  The Telegraph reported that Abedi was the son of Libyan refugees who fled the regime of dictator Muammar Gadaffi. Gadaffi was killed by rebels in 2011 and the Telegraph cited reports that Abediâ€™s family had returned to Libya  â€”   but Abedi remained. Police raided Abediâ€™s house in Fallowfield, South Manchester Tuesday. Fallowfield is the home of a large student population, being a short bus ride away from the main Manchester University campus, and just three miles from Manchesterâ€™s city center.  South Manchester as a whole has a large Muslim population, often gathered in very small areas and raising questions about the risks that a lack of assimilation can bring. According to 2011 census data, 20 percent of Fallowfieldâ€™s population was Muslim. But nearby areas are even more concentrated. Rusholme, a few minutes walk from Fallowfield, had a 37. 9 percent Muslim population in 2011, while nearby Longsight had a 53. 8 percent Muslim population.  That data does not account for any increases in the Muslim population in the last six years. Nearby Rusholme is known for its famous â€œcurry mile,â€ a series of South Asian and Middle Eastern restaurants populating one of the cityâ€™s main roads  â€”   a road annually brought to a standstill by traffic during the Muslim celebration of Eid.  The Telegraph also noted that Abedi grew up in an area where two girls from a nearby school left their homes in 2015 to live in   Syria. The Guardian reported that what it called â€œManchesterâ€™s Libyan communityâ€ had   problems before.  Abdalraouf Abdallah, 24, was jailed for nine and a half years last year after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism. Abdallah had helped a number of men travel to Syria so they could fight in the civil war. He was unable to travel himself because he is paralysed from the waist down after being shot during the Libyan revolution. One of the people he helped to send to Syria was Stephen Gray, who had converted to Islam after leaving the air force in 2004. He was jailed for nine years after pleading guilty to terrorist offences. A family friend told the Guardian that Abedi and Abdallah knew each other. A neighbour told The New York Times that the family frequently flew a Libyan flag outside the window, while a school friend told the Daily Mail that Abedi had recently grown a beard, and was â€œacting strange. â€ Abedi was also reported to have been praying loudly in Arabic in the street. â€œThey were a Libyan family. A couple of months ago he was chanting the first kalma [Islamic prayer] really loudly in the street. He was chanting in Arabic. He was saying â€˜There is only one God and the prophet Mohammed is his messengerâ€™ a neighbor told the Mail. â€˜They dressed very traditionally, in Islamic clothes. The mother used to wear a headscarf,â€ another said. The Washington Post reported that Abediâ€™s brother had been taken into custody. Details of Abediâ€™s background come amid reports that he was already known to security services, but authorities concluded that he did not mark an immediate threat. It seems that local authorities are unlikely to move quickly on any problems with assimilation. Labour Party candidate Afzal Khan, who is campaigning to be the Member of Parliament for the area in which Abedi lived, told reporters hours before the bombing: I donâ€™t think immigration is a problem  â€¦     It has transformed Manchester into a world class city. â€  Afzal Khan says â€I donâ€™t think immigration is a problem  â€¦     It has transformed Manchester into a world class cityâ€ #gorton hustings,  â€”   Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) May 22, 2017,  Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Hopkins, in his remarks after the bombing, seemed less concerned with the threat of a lack of assimilation in   communities and more concerned with a     Islamophobic backlash. â€œWe understand that feelings are very raw right now and people are bound to be looking for answers. However, now, more than ever, it is vital that our diverse communities in Greater Manchester stand together and do not tolerate hate,â€ he told reporters.

The famous painting was stolen in 1911 in an Italian heist and not recovered for two years.

[â€œNow did not enforcing the red line hurt us diplomatically?â€ Harf said at a discussion at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.

Michael Pregent, adjunct fellow at Hudson, said that the strike on Assadâ€™s military assets ordered by President Donald Trump after the April 4 chemical attack that killed scores of innocent people, including children, was Trumpâ€™s most significant foreign policy win since taking office. Assad denied  â€”   as he has repeatedly done over the course of the more than   civil war  â€”   that he was responsible for the attack. But the U.

The two had a productive and constructive call regarding the bilateral relationship between the two countries, the current trade deficit the United States has with Mexico, the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales. With respect to payment for the border wall, both presidents recognize their clear and very public differences of positions on this issue but have agreed to work these differences out as part of a comprehensive discussion on all aspects of the bilateral relationship. Both presidents have instructed their teams to continue the dialogue to strengthen this important strategic and economic relationship in a constructive way.

20971,"Heâ€™s â€˜Littleâ€™ in the Film â€˜Moonlight,â€™ but Big on the Dodgeball Court - The New York Times",Joanna Nikas,"LOS ANGELES  â€”   Alex R. Hibbert eyed a group of six children whipping red and yellow balls at one another in a large, reverberant pit made with trampoline floors and walls. He wanted in. But one player needed to get nailed by a ball and knocked out of the game first. He stood in line, his feet fidgeting, before bailing. He ran over to a nearby trampoline, pulled up his hoodie, crouched down and launched himself first upward and then backward into a flip. â€œYou bend your feet, keep your hands all the way and jump as high as you want,â€ he said. â€œYou get maximum air. Once you hit the air then you flip. But you donâ€™t want to do too much because you might do a double flip. â€ Alex is the    actor who plays Chiron (also knows as â€œLittleâ€) in â€œMoonlight,â€ the    film about growing up in a   area of Miami as a character in the process of understanding his sexuality. The film has received eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture. In real life, he lives in Miami, where he is a   student, but he was recently in Los Angeles for a busy weekend of award shows (he attended both the Producers Guild Awards and the Screen Actors Guild awards) and auditions. So he would have a proper tux to wear to the SAG awards, he also had to stand still for a suit fitting. Thatâ€™s a lot for an energetic kid. A few hours at the Sky Zone trampoline park in the Van Nuys neighborhood was his   play time. â€œIâ€™m open,â€ he yelled, his arms spread wide. A ball came straight at his head and he ducked. Then he grabbed it and hurled it at the opposite side of the dodgeball pit, which now had him alone against three boys. He came to the tables, out of breath but happy. â€œItâ€™s a battlefield out there,â€ he told his mother, Donna Wellington. â€œBut Iâ€™m coming out on top. â€ He grabbed for a cherry Icee she was holding for him and took a big gulp. Ms. Wellington snagged it. â€œDonâ€™t drink all of that,â€ she said to her son. â€œYouâ€™ll get a stomachache. â€ He made a face, then set the drink down. He has gotten a lot of attention because of his ability to make faces. â€œMoonlightâ€ opens with a scene focused on Alex, but itâ€™s not until about 10 minutes into it that he actually has a line. Critics and moviegoers have been taken by Alexâ€™s performance, most of it delivered without any words, in which he communicates the adolescent angst of a young boy growing up in an environment where his sexuality is not understood. â€œMahershala taught me a lot of tips about facials,â€ he said of his   Mahershala Ali, whom he calls his second father. â€œHe was all like, â€˜Just think about the moment that is going on. â€™â€ Alex didnâ€™t grow up as an   kid looking for a big break. He was living a typical life when stardom found him. He was born in New York City, and lived in Queens until 2011, when his mother decided to move with him to live closer to her own mother. (Alex has one sister, Robin, 22, from his fatherâ€™s side, who lives in New York with their father.) He goes to a performing arts magnet middle school in Miami Gardens, Fla. loves science class (even though he said school was â€œmostly boring,â€ he knows it will help him succeed in his lifeâ€™s ambition of curing cancer) and is expected to help out at home by doing the dishes and taking out the trash. But in March 2016, Alexâ€™s drama teacher, Tanisha Cidel (she played the role of the principal in the film) suggested to him that he audition for â€œMoonlight. â€ He assumed it was a school production. â€œI didnâ€™t know it was going to be that big,â€ he said. â€œI thought it was going to be like a play or something. â€ It was Alexâ€™s grandmother, Hillary Frye, who took him to the â€œMoonlightâ€ audition. She is now his unofficial publicist. â€œEvery day since the film came she buys a New York Times paper at the   and looks for Alexâ€™s picture in it,â€ Ms. Wellington said. â€œSheâ€™s going crazy, she tells everyone at work, â€˜Thatâ€™s my grandson! â€™â€ His mother is trying to adapt to the new normal of having a son who suddenly is invited to award shows and auditions. So long as the hoopla doesnâ€™t interfere with school, Ms. Wellington is accommodating. On Monday, it was back to their normal routine. â€œNothing changed,â€ said his mother, who works at a nursing facility. â€œWhen I travel back and forth, I go right back to work. And Alex goes back to school. â€ But he had a few days of glamour before he returned to real life, and some time before the media crush to just be a little kid. After dominating the trampoline, the foam pit, air hockey and the dodgeball court, he had by now moved on to the basketball   game. Before his mother could even make her way over, he had racked up 41 points. â€œI beat the record,â€ he hollered to her. He sidestepped to the adjacent machine where he tossed the ball some more, to the tune of 43 points. In celebration, he dabbed. He wasnâ€™t done, though. He was ready for more dodgeball. It was 8 p. m. and his mother wasnâ€™t. â€œAlex, Iâ€™m tired,â€ said Ms. Wellington, who had just accompanied her son to London, where Alex accepted an award on behalf of Mr. Ali. â€œMom, one more game,â€ he pleaded. She gave him a    â€”   apparently a talent for nonverbal communication is a family trait. â€œO. K.,â€ he said, â€œI guess it is time to go. â€ Anyway, he will need his sleep, given the magnitude of his dreams. There is the whole   thing. He would also like to have an acting career like Denzel Washington, to do action movies like Andrew Garfield and get cast on a popular TV series. â€œI want to be on â€˜The Walking Dead,â€™â€ he said. â€œI need to talk to my managers about that. â€"
20972,Trump Reverses Obamaâ€™s Last Days Drilling Ban - Breitbart,Michelle Moons,"WASHINGTON, D. C. â€”  President Donald Trump on Friday signed a new executive order on an   Offshore Energy Strategy as he proclaimed, â€œItâ€™s going to lead to a lot of great wealth for our country and a lot of great jobs for our country. â€[From the Roosevelt Room of the White House, President Trump thanked Secretaries Wilbur Ross and Ryan Zinke, lauded their job performance, then told those gathered:  This is a great day for American workers and families, and today weâ€™re unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of   American energy jobs. Our country is blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves. But the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production.  And when they say closed, they mean closed. This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. I pledged to take action, and today I am keeping that promise. The President stated that the order initiates â€œopening offshore areas to   energy exploration,â€ which reverses an Obama Administration Arctic leasing ban. â€œIt reverses the previous administrationâ€™s Arctic leasing ban, and directs Secretary Zinke to allow responsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our Treasury and jobs to our workers. â€   Barack Obama seized this last daysâ€™ opportunity to shore up his environmental policy in December 2016. The Washington Post reported that he banned offshore oil and gas drilling in hundreds of millions of acres of federal land in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. The ban was coordinated with a related move by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The report cited a White House aide, who claimed regarding the Section   of the 1953 act withdrawals, â€œThere is no authority for subsequent presidents to     â€¦     I canâ€™t speak to what a future Congress will do. â€ After the   Arctic leasing ban was announced, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) responded in a tweet the Post cited, â€œYet another Obama abuse of power. Hopefully, on[e] that will be reversed  â€¦    exactly one month from today. â€ Trump added that the order, â€œwill enable better scientific study of our offshore resources and research that has blocked everything from happening for far too long. â€ The result, according to Trump, will be energy cost reduction and job creation, while making the country more secure and energy independent. â€œItâ€™s going to lead to a lot of great wealth for our country and a lot of great jobs for our country,â€ said Trump. Ahead of the Presidentâ€™s speech, Vice President Mike Pence called the order â€œan important step toward American energy independence. â€ The entire executive order can be found at WhiteHouse. gov.

20973,Was This An Alien Contact? Scientists Think So â€“ NOT SATIRE (VIDEO),Grownmangrumbles,"Itâ€™s our go to response. When the lights are out and the floorboard creaks. When a branch taps a slow waltz against the window pane and our hackles dance a primordial shimmy, we ask the question. The oldest question. â€œIs there anyone there?â€ 
Turns out, the answer is yes. Not The Alien Contact We Expected 
It was a little thing really. Giant leap for mankind moments often are. There were no ships hovering over national landmarks, no grainy footage of aliens being dissected on steel-gray slabs. No â€˜take me to your leader momentsâ€™ at all. 
No, our first potentially legitimate brush with alien intelligence came as one might expect; from the nocturnal laboring of two dedicated scientists. 
It was the kind of science you donâ€™t get to see. The methodical pace, the slow transition from hypothesis to data that is the hallmark of good research. The pair painstakingly surveyed a patch of sky simply because it was in need of surveying. They examined some 2.5 million stars, and in doing so, E.F. Borra and E. Trottie of Quebecâ€™s Laval University might have made the single most important discovery in human history. 
You see, while the vast majority of the stars they examined were acting in exactly the way they had expected, a tiny fraction of them â€“ 234 in total â€“ were not. 
They were exhibiting bizarre modulations that defied easy explanation; they could not be attributed to any known natural phenomena. Indeed, they didnâ€™t look natural at all. 
They looked like someone, or rather something, was attempting to communicate with us. 
Like, for real. 
Because these were the kind of signals that one might expect an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) to use if they were attempting to communicate with us. they were using the oldest known method of attracting attention in the dark 
They were shining a light at us. Great Expectations 
In a study published in 2012, Borra had proposed this very approach. He wrote : â€œConsider an extraterrestrial civilization that is more advanced than ours. Let us assume that they want to signal their existence to other civilizations. This is not an easy task considering how vast the universe is. The best chance of being seen is by being accidentally detected during astronomical observations. They know, on the basis of their own experience, that a scientifically advanced civilization observes the sky and takes spectra of astronomical objects. In particular, spectroscopic surveys are carried out.â€ 
These surveys would inevitably reveal the very same modulations that the two Canadian scientists just discovered. Utterly dissimilar to the usual background â€˜noiseâ€™ of the universe, once detected, they would warrant further investigation. Like ships sailing on a pitch black sea, an alert lookout could easily differentiate between the naturally occurring light flashes of reflected moonbeams or distant lightning, from the frantic signalling of a nearby vessel. 
At least, thatâ€™s the theory. 
Still, there was yet more compelling evidence that this was indeed an attempt at communication. 
The 234 stars in Borra and Trottierâ€™s study all had one thing in common. The modulations all came from stars very much like our own Sun, the only star that we know for certain harbors intelligent life. Phone Home? 
The most obvious answer is that we need to dig deeper; as Borra acknowledged: â€œ Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .â€ 
The need for further research notwithstanding, a very real question needs to be explored. Could we, and indeed should we, attempt to communicate back? 
The practical considerations are not insignificant. The signal device, a powerful laser of some kind, could be based on Earth but would have to shine its beam to a space station that contained mirrors capable of redirecting the light to the targets. 
Such a station would have to be sent on a long lonely voyage of around 614 astronomical units or about 20 times further than Pluto, something Barros described as being : â€œNot an overwhelmingly large distance.â€ 
Indeed the distance the mirror would have to be placed would scale with he distance of the civilization we were trying to contact. Using an existing technology known as a solar sail we could : â€œReach Pluto in 5 years. For an ETI at a 100 lt-yr distance from Earth, the (mirrorâ€™s) location would thus be reached within 10 years. 
An attempt to reach a civilization even further away would of course take longer, perhaps a century or more and whilst Barro admitted that: â€œThis is a long time.â€ 
He remained adamant that it was not : â€œâ€¦Overwhelmingly so, considering that the ETI civilization may be thousands of years older than ours.â€ 
Humanity then, is on the cusp of being able to send similar signals ourselves. But should we? This Island Earth 
According the Professor Stephen Hawking, it might not be such a good idea. While he is convinced that we are not alone in the universe he cautioned that : â€œWe should be wary of answering back.â€ 
In Hawkingâ€™s view, a meeting between two civilizations would resemble Christopher Columbusâ€™ historic meeting of Native Americans. 
Something that he noted : â€œDidnâ€™t turn out so well.â€ 
Still, whether we chose to respond or not remains peripheral to the sheer magnitude of the discovery. That intelligent alien life is not only out there but that they are trying to say hello. If true, it points to a universality of at least one pervasive human emotion. 
Curiosity. 
Itâ€™s still not definite; itâ€™s still only a â€˜probably,â€™ but weâ€™ve never been closer to a possible answer. It would be nice to finally know for sure. After all, weâ€™ve been wondering for so long. 
As the Epicurean philosopher and poet Lucretius once said : â€œNothing in the universe is unique and alone and therefore in other regions there must be other earths inhabited by different tribes of men and breeds of beasts.â€ 
Yeah, there must be.

20974,"Andrzej Wajda, Towering Auteur of Polish Cinema, Dies at 90 - The New York Times",Michael T. Kaufman,"  Andrzej Wajda, who mined Polish history to create films that established him as one of the worldâ€™s great directors and won him an Academy Award for his lifeâ€™s work, died on Sunday. He was 90. His death was confirmed by the Association of Polish Filmmakers, which did not specify where he died. The director Jacek Bromski, head of the association, said Mr. Wajda had recently been hospitalized. From his trilogy of Polandâ€™s wartime resistance (â€œA Generation,â€ â€Kanalâ€ and â€œAshes and Diamondsâ€) to his twin portraits of workers under Communism (â€œMan of Marbleâ€ and â€œMan of Ironâ€) to his final film, â€œAfterimage,â€ released this year, Mr. Wajda unceasingly drew on Polish reality, sensibilities and memory, stressing elements that were at times mystifying to foreign viewers. His absorption in those sensibilities, and in quintessentially Polish subjects, like the romantic appeal of lost causes, extended beyond plot and subtext to the iconography with which he filled his movies, a tendency he lamented but could not escape. â€œI would gladly trade in this clutch of national symbols  â€”   sabers, white horses, red poppies  â€”   for a handful of sexual symbols from a Freudian textbook,â€ he once said. â€œThe trouble is that I just wasnâ€™t brought up on Freud. â€ He was also aware that the tensions of the Cold War sometimes estranged Western audiences from his subjects and his style. â€œFilms made in Eastern Europe seem of little or no interest to people in the West,â€ he wrote in â€œDouble Vision: My Life in Filmâ€ (1989). Western audiences, he said, â€œfind them as antediluvian as the battle for workersâ€™ rights in England in the time of Marx. â€ But the biggest problems he faced were the practical ones of government disapproval, and sometimes outright censorship, before Poland rid itself of Communist control. That he succeeded in overcoming so much to produce towering works of art earned him the enduring regard of his countrymen. And as opaque as his allusions may have seemed outside Poland, his international reputation grew steadily. Western film historians eventually mentioned him alongside Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa. He was given the Japanese Imperial Prize for his contribution to film in 1996 and an honorary Academy Award in 2000. He also received lifetime achievement awards from the film festivals in Venice in 1998 and Berlin in 2006. The images and textures that shaped the imaginative landscape of Mr. Wajdaâ€™s films were drawn from a life that reflected Polandâ€™s tragic modern history, beginning with the outbreak of World War II, when the Nazis invaded and obliterated Poland in partnership with the Russians. The agony continued through nearly six years of German occupation, when the Nazis used Polish soil to establish the ghettos and killing fields of the Holocaust. Then, with liberation, came more decades of totalitarian oppression as successive regimes in Moscow sought to impose   Communism on a devoutly Roman Catholic country, an effort that even Stalin once conceded was like â€œputting a saddle on a bull. â€ Andrzej Wajda (pronounced    ) was born on March 6, 1926, in Suwalki, a garrison town near Polandâ€™s border with Lithuania. His father was a cavalry officer, and as young Andrzej moved with his parents from camp to camp, he and his brother would playfully choreograph their own battles while all around them real troops carried out training maneuvers. The German Army invaded when he was 13. Two weeks later, the Russians joined in the dismemberment of Poland. The country was quickly overrun by Nazi and Communist forces carrying out the collusion of the   pact. As it did for many Poles, history turned personal for Mr. Wajda. His father was one of thousands of Polish officers taken prisoner and killed by the Russians in the Katyn Forest in western Russia and other locations. Though most Poles came to understand who was responsible for what was known simply as Katyn, the official version of events under Communist rule insisted that the Polish officers had been killed by the Germans. Only in 1991 could Mr. Wajda, by then an elected senator in   Poland, make a documentary called â€œThe Katyn Forestâ€ in homage to his father and those murdered with him. His 2007 dramatization of the same story, called simply â€œKatyn,â€ was an Oscar nominee for best   film. A. O. Scott, in The New York Times, praised it as â€œa powerful corrective to decades of distortion and forgetting. â€ After his father disappeared, young Andrzej lived through the war with his mother, a teacher, working at odd jobs in the countryside. He also had what he later called â€œa posting of no significanceâ€ with the Home Army, a resistance group sponsored by the   Polish government in exile in London. He enrolled in the Fine Arts Academy in Krakow after the war but transferred to the newly opened Film School in Lodz. He began making films soon after graduating. His first, â€œA Generation,â€ finished in 1955, was shot in settings of rubble and ruin, in a Warsaw that had not yet recovered from the    devastation of the war. It centered on the wartime experiences of a tough Warsaw adolescent who joins a resistance group headed by a young woman with whom he has fallen in love. Some aspects of the film reflect the Communist Party line of the time the young Communist fighters are depicted as purer, braver and more committed than the members of the Home Army. But with its nuanced characters, â€œA Generationâ€ transcends propaganda. In 1956, in the wake of worker upheavals that preceded the Hungarian uprising against Soviet Communist domination, Mr. Wajda made â€œKanal,â€ the second film of his war trilogy. It deals with another uprising: the 1944 struggle of the citizens of Warsaw to free themselves from Nazi occupation. â€œKanalâ€ tells the story of a corps of resistance fighters who are cut off from the main insurgent force and try to escape through the cityâ€™s sewers. It follows three groups of men and women as they wander in the cold, dark water, fearful of German booby traps and electrical wires. Some break down some die in the sewers others sustain hopes and illusions, only to be captured by the Germans. The last of the trilogy that established Mr. Wajdaâ€™s international reputation was â€œAshes and Diamondsâ€ (1958) a dramatization of a novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski, set on the day Germany surrendered in 1945. The Communists have taken over the wheels of government, and membership in the   resistance is suddenly suspect. Maciek, a young former soldier of the Home Army, is instructed to assassinate a Communist official who is arriving to take control of a provincial town. The official is a compassionate man who has suffered greatly in concentration camps. When Maciek encounters him on the street, he shoots him dead. He slips away but panics when he sees police officers checking the papers of   he starts to run and is killed. As dawn rises, marking the end of the first 24 hours of peace, Maciekâ€™s body is sprawled on a rubbish heap. Mr. Wajda went on to direct more than 40 theatrical and television films, among them narrowly focused psychological portraits like â€œInnocent Sorcerersâ€ (1960) and expansive adaptations of historical novels and stories by celebrated Polish writers, like Stefan Zeromskiâ€™s â€œThe Ashesâ€ (1965) and Stanislaw Wyspianskiâ€™s â€œThe Weddingâ€ (1973). His largely improvised â€œEverything for Saleâ€ (1968) was a tribute to Zbigniew Cybulski, the charismatic star of â€œAshes and Diamonds,â€ who was killed while trying to leap aboard a train in 1967. Mr. Wajda returned several times to films set against the backdrop of World War II and focused on the tragedy of Polandâ€™s Jews with films like â€œSamsonâ€ (1961) â€œLandscape After the Battleâ€ (1970) â€œKorczakâ€ (1991) and â€œHoly Weekâ€ (1995). Most of these films were shown in the West, although it was not until the late 1970s that Mr. Wajdaâ€™s work again received the worldwide critical attention that had welcomed his earliest work. This phase started with â€œMan of Marble,â€ which he completed in 1976 but which was kept from audiences abroad until a political thaw in Warsaw emboldened bureaucrats to issue it an export license in 1978. In that film, a student filmmaker, memorably played by Krystyna Janda, is trying to find out what became of a bricklayer who in the Stalinist â€™50s had won national fame for his enthusiastic productivity. After tracing the workerâ€™s rise as a   hero, she uncovers his decline at the hands of the same government that once extolled him. Mr. Wajda tells his story like a thriller: The truth emerges through the shifting Communist propaganda of two decades as depicted in interview after interview, newsreel after newsreel. When â€œMan of Marbleâ€ was released in Poland, some three million people saw it in less than three months, and arguments about its content broke out all over the country. The Poles knew that the Communist government had censored the crucial final scene of the film and refused to allow its presentation at the Cannes Film Festival as an official entry. But it was shown there anyway, and it won the International Federation of Film Critics prize. Reviewing the movie in The Times, Vincent Canby called it â€œa political epic, compassionate and as bitterly funny as a cartoon. â€ As the disintegration of Communist rule accelerated in Poland, more quickly than in the other Soviet satellite states, Mr. Wajda played an active role as both an artist and a patriot. In 1981, when the Solidarity   movement was mushrooming, Mr. Wajda released â€œMan of Iron,â€ his sequel to â€œMan of Marble. â€ In this film, the Communist government sends a reporter to Gdansk, ostensibly to cover the strike by shipyard workers there but really to smear one of its leaders. The leader turns out to be the son of the bricklayer of â€œMan of Marble,â€ who is married to the young documentary filmmaker who uncovered the truth about his father. Soon the reporter gets caught up in the passion of the event he has been assigned to discredit. â€œMan of Ironâ€ was made as Solidarity was gaining momentum. Real members of Solidarity, including the movementâ€™s leader, Lech Walesa, appear in the film alongside fictional characters. A late entry at Cannes, it was awarded the Golden Palm. Mr. Wajda was allowed to insert the censored last scene of â€œMan of Marbleâ€ into â€œMan of Iron. â€ â€œThat was the best sign,â€ he later recalled, â€œthat in the years between the two movies the Communists really started losing ground. â€ He organized and ran the Solidarity filmmakersâ€™ union and became an active member of the Committee to Help Workers, a major dissident organization. But the last Polish Communist government struck back and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, its leader, banned Solidarity and declared martial law. As censorship intensified, Mr. Wajda encouraged the clandestine distribution of banned films by his younger colleagues through underground cassettes. The government moved against him, and for the next four years disapproved his film projects he was not able to work in his homeland again until 1985. Leaving Poland, he directed two films that drew critical praise. In â€œDanton,â€ made in France in 1982, he drew parallels to the political situation in Poland with his portrayal of the conflict between the moderate, democratic Danton (played by GÃ©rard Depardieu) and the   Robespierre (played by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak) during the Reign of Terror that followed the French Revolution. In â€œA Love in Germanyâ€ (1983) a     he focused on a passionate and unconcealed love affair during World War II between a German woman (Hanna Schygulla) and a Polish prisoner of war working as a slave laborer (Piotr Lysak). After Communism finally collapsed in 1989, Mr. Wajda was one of the national luminaries asked to run for the Polish Senate by Mr. Walesa, who was about to become president. Mr. Wajda served a single term and then returned to films. But in a situation repeated in other former Eastern bloc countries, Hollywood blockbusters became more readily available on Polish screens, and the subsidies that had spawned and sustained a great national cinema dwindled. Many Polish directors who followed in Mr. Wajdaâ€™s footsteps and who had worked with him began making movies abroad. In contrast, Mr. Wajda stayed home. Though he continued to make the occasional film, he devoted much of his energy to theater he often staged works adapted from Russian literature at the Stary Theater in Krakow. Among his notable later works, in addition to â€œKatyn,â€ were â€œThe Revengeâ€ (2002) a period comedy with a cast that included Roman Polanski, and â€œTatarakâ€ (2009) the story of a   woman obsessed with a much younger man. Mr. Wajda was married four times. Survivors include his wife, the actress and stage designer Krystyna Zachwatowicz, and a daughter, Karolina. One of Mr. Wajdaâ€™s last films was â€œWalesa: Man of Hope,â€ released in 2013 and considered by many to be the final part of a trilogy that began with â€œMan of Marble. â€ Starring the Polish movie and television actor Robert Wieckiewicz  â€”   who spoke in an interview with The Times about the pressure of â€œplaying a legend, directed by a legendâ€  â€”   it was the first Polish film to examine Lech Walesa and his work with Solidarity in depth. At a news conference announcing his plans to make â€œWalesa,â€ Mr. Wajda said that he viewed it as his greatest professional challenge to date. He quoted Mr. Walesa himself, when he ran for president of Poland, to describe his own feelings about making the film. â€œI donâ€™t want to,â€ he said, â€œbut I have to. â€"

20976,House Republicans in Close Races Worry Trumpâ€™s Problems May Hurt Them - The New York Times,Emmarie Huetteman,"LANSDOWNE, Va.  â€”   Like many Republican candidates, Representative Barbara Comstock is trying to prevent Donald J. Trumpâ€™s problems from becoming hers. Early on, she supported Senator Marco Rubioâ€™s presidential bid. In ensuing months, she remained resolutely reticent on Mr. Trump, simply never uttering his name in trying to avoid any political undertow that he might create. But after the release last week of a recording in which Mr. Trump boasted in vulgar terms about assaulting women, Ms. Comstock was among the first Republicans to call on him to step down. â€œThis is disgusting, vile and disqualifying,â€ she said in a statement. â€œNo woman should ever be subjected to this type of obscene behavior, and it is unbecoming of anybody seeking high office. â€ Ms. Comstock is hoping her disavowal will be enough. The outcome here in Loudoun County, which in recent years has been seen as a bellwether in presidential politics, will provide a measure of any   damage that Mr. Trumpâ€™s contentious candidacy may have caused. Ms. Comstockâ€™s wealthy, highly educated district in the suburbs of Washington is a   hub of government largess, where federal contractors commute past Buddhist temples, mosques and churches that offer services in Korean. â€œIf the Democrats have any prayer of taking the House, and I think itâ€™s just a long shot, theyâ€™ve got to win this seat,â€ said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman who represented portions of Ms. Comstockâ€™s district. So far, many analysts say, there is scant evidence that voters will penalize candidates because of Mr. Trump. â€œBelieve it or not, it hasnâ€™t changed matters all that much,â€ said David Wasserman, the House of Representatives editor for The Cook Political Report. He has forecast that Democrats could pick up as many as 20 seats, 10 short of the number needed to regain control of the House. Polls have shown that voters are willing to separate their support for certain House and Senate candidates from their feelings about the top of the ticket. In an effort to bolster Ms. Comstock and other vulnerable Republicans, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a â€œsuper PACâ€ aligned with Republicans, announced Friday that it would invest an additional $10 million into 15 targeted races, including hers. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin also has tried to ensure his party holds its House majority, offering a policy agenda and promising appearances in dozens of cities to lend his   power. His campaign said on Thursday that Mr. Ryan had raised $15. 4 million in the third quarter, collecting more than $48. 2 million in 2016. He has transferred more than $31 million of that to the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Ryan  â€”   having disinvited Mr. Trump from their first planned joint appearance in Wisconsin last weekend after news of the recording broke  â€”   effectively cut his members free on Monday, saying he would not defend nor campaign with Mr. Trump. He has instead shifted his focus to the argument that Republicans need to be   to serve as a bulwark against a potential President Hillary Clinton. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, has proved once more to be a   powerhouse, raising $34. 6 million for House Democrats in the third quarter and $127. 7 million this election cycle, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said on Wednesday. Initial reactions to the 2005 recording of Mr. Trump have also given Democrats cause for optimism. A Wall Street   News poll, conducted shortly after the recording was released by The Washington Post, showed 49 percent of voters preferred Democrats take control of Congress, compared with 42 percent who preferred Republicans  â€”   the largest advantage for Democrats since the government shutdown in 2013. But Democrats have a steep climb. With 247 seats, House Republicans hold their largest majority since 1931. Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor of the Rothenberg  Gonzales Political Report, estimates that Republicans have already locked up 217 seats  â€”   and they only need 218 to keep their majority. But Republican strategists are haunted by the prospect that voters who would typically support Republicans might become so disillusioned that they choose to stay home. â€œThis is a highly polarized environment,â€ Mr. Wasserman said. â€œAnd I think the only reason for Democrats to overperform on Election Day is that Republicans are so depressed that they donâ€™t show up. â€ At this point, that does not look very likely, he said. While more educated, conservative voters who may have been more likely to split their ticket are looking less enthusiastic, Mr. Trumpâ€™s base remains energized, he said. In the suburbs of Minneapolis, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has run ads trying to tie Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is unpopular there, but the contest had been trending in favor of Mr. Paulsen  â€”   who last week joined Ms. Comstock in announcing he would not vote for him. Similarly, in northeastern Iowa, Democrats have been struggling to oust Representative Rod Blum, a Republican who is a member of the   House Freedom Caucus. Mr. Blumâ€™s district voted for Mr. Obama twice, but the pickup, originally thought to be likely, has been bedeviling Democrats. Mr. Blum has denounced Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks but did not comment on whether he would continue to support him, according to The Des Moines Register. Districts that had been seeing a   Trump effect appear to be the ones with higher concentrations of Latinos and Asians, Mr. Wasserman said. Also,   white women  â€”   a group that may be especially motivated by animus toward Mr. Trump  â€”   are also showing strikingly strong support for Mrs. Clinton this year, said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. Though Ms. Comstockâ€™s district trends slightly Republican, voters twice supported Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump is not popular here. Mr. Davis, who represented the area for seven terms, said most voter aversion to Mr. Trump stemmed from his propensity for insults. â€œThis is a pretty dignified, educated group, and theyâ€™re just not into insulting people and all that,â€ he said. â€œNot particularly liberal, but dignified. â€ Just one day before disavowing Mr. Trump, during a debate hosted by the local chamber of commerce here, Ms. Comstock cited a collaboration with Senator Tim Kaine, a fellow Virginian and the Democratic   nominee. She twice invoked Bill Clinton, the president whose administration she built a reputation investigating in the 1990s as a House chief counsel. She steered clear of saying Mr. Trumpâ€™s name, saying she was â€œstill watchingâ€ the race to decide who would get her vote. LuAnn Bennett, a real estate developer who is challenging Ms. Comstock, on Wednesday slammed her for waiting so long to reject Mr. Trump. â€œIâ€™m afraid that what my opponent was clearly â€˜watchingâ€™ for was how best to preserve her own political career,â€ she said."
20977,Swedish Police Chief Shut Down By Interior Minister After Call to Deport Terror Suspects,Virginia Hale,"Citing â€œfreedom of speechâ€ and the possibility that expelled migrants risk â€œpersecutionâ€ if sent back to their homelands, Swedenâ€™s Justice Minister rejected Erik Nordâ€™s call to deport Islamic   migrants and demanded the police chief â€œexplain himselfâ€. [â€œNot because it would have prevented Fridayâ€™s attack but surely we should be able to withdraw Swedish residency rights from people who support violent extremism,â€ wrote the Greater Gothenburg police chief on Sunday, two days after an alleged terror attack in Stockholm in which four people died and many were injured.  But government minister Morgan Johansson slapped down Nordâ€™s â€œproblematicâ€ suggestion, for which he said the police chief needs to â€œexplain himselfâ€. â€œWe have freedom of speech in Sweden. This means people have the right to hold repulsive opinions here,â€ said Johansson. â€œBut there are always limits  â€¦     For example when it comes to hate speech,â€ he added. Asserting that migrants with residence permits are in Sweden because they are in need of protection, the Social Democratic party politician warned that â€œthere is a risk [migrants who support violent extremism] could face persecution if they were sent backâ€. Nord told the Gothenburg Post on Sunday: â€œWe should be able to tell   who are going around proposing the nation become a totalitarian state, be it political or religious, that they have to go back home where they belong. â€ Noting how currently Sweden can only deport individuals found guilty of committing or funding acts of terror, the police chief argued that it should also be possible for the nation to expel people who say they support groups which back violent extremism. â€œSure there are going to be people who say ISIS is great and that religious extremism is fantastic. But then I donâ€™t think these people should be allowed to stay in Sweden where they are bankrolled and have their lifestyles paid for by the government. â€ â€œIslam itself is not extreme, but there are forms of Islamism and jihad which are causing problems,â€ he continued. â€œAt this point in time, we know that there are many people going around and giving lectures in support of this sort of extremism. â€œI just donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair,â€ Nord added, telling the newspaper that police receive intelligence about Islamist preachers â€œall the timeâ€. â€œItâ€™s disgusting that we allow bad people to canvass here, waving ISIS flags,â€ said Nord. â€œItâ€™s an insult to those who have fled from Islamic State. â€ â€œI realise that the things Iâ€™m saying here could be read as political statements. But weâ€™re living in a new reality now in which, sometimes, itâ€™s important that we be allowed to talk about things we observe,â€ he told Expressen."
20978,â€™Liberal Answer to Breitbart Newsâ€™ Loses CEO Before It Even Launches - Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,"The much ballyhooed â€œBreitbart of the leftâ€ planned by Clinton apologist David Brock lost its CEO before the site even launched, as investigative reporter David Sirota announced he is bowing out of the project. [After the disastrous 2016 election revealed that his Hilary Clinton cheerleading efforts were woefully ineffective, David Brock went back to liberal donors with his hand out  â€”   asking for even more cash to start a new website that he promised would become the leftâ€™s â€œanswer to Breitbart News. â€  Not long after his initial announcement, Brock proudly reported that he had hired investigative reporter David Sirota as the CEO of the new effort named True Blue Media. Sirota was said to be preparing to quit his role as senior investigations editor at the International Business Times to lead Brockâ€™s new Breitbart of the left. But now it appears those plans have fallen apart. This week Sirota sent out an email to supporters and friends to â€œpass on some personal newsâ€ explaining that â€œcircumstances of the job changedâ€ and he is now taking a pass on the role as chief of the leftâ€™s answer to Breitbart. â€œAs you know, I was thrilled to initially accept the proposal to work with True Blue Media because I believe in nonpartisan accountability journalism,â€ Sirota said in his statement. â€œHowever, the circumstances of the job subsequently changed. True Blue Media does not right now have in hand the resources for the kind of independent, nonpartisan journalism I want to continue to do and that is needed to execute on the ambitious editorial strategy that we agreed on. Therefore, I have decided to turn down the job. I wish David Brock all the best. â€ Sirota did not elaborate on exactly what had changed between the time he initially agreed to head up Brockâ€™s news website and todayâ€™s decision to bail out of the project. But the statement hints to the possibility that Brock is not getting the funding he would need for the sort of fully staffed news organization Sirota had envisioned. Perhaps Sirota doesnâ€™t want to be part of a mere propaganda effort and expected the resources to be able to sustain a serious news bureau. The news comes on the heels of reports that many top liberal donors are getting tired of David Brockâ€™s many failed efforts to â€œhelpâ€ the liberal cause. Early in January, for instance Clinton donor John Morgan complained, â€œAnybody who gives money to him is pissing down a rathole. â€ Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
20979,Trump Says He Likes Janet Yellen and Supports the Export-Import Bank - Breitbart,John Carney,"President Donald Trump reversed himself Wednesday on the leadership of the Federal Reserve and the fate of the U. S.   Bank. [In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said that was open to the possibility of renominating Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen once her current term of office expires next year. During the campaign he was critical of Yellen, describing her as â€œpoliticalâ€ for keeping rates low, and said that he â€œmost likelyâ€ would replace her as Fed chief.  â€œI like her, I respect her,â€ Trump said.  He added that â€œitâ€™s very early. â€ When asked if Yellen was â€œtoast,â€ the president said, â€œNo. Not toast. â€ This has caught many on Wall Street and Capitol Hill by surprise, overturning the near universal expectation that Trump would pick a new head for the central bank. The possibility that Trump may support the status quo at the Fed has some supporters scratching their heads. On Wall Street, this is widely viewed as the result of the influence of Gary Cohn and other financiers on the president. â€œI think weâ€™re seeing the influence of guys like Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin and Steve Schwarzman. They probably explained that markets want him to show heâ€™s   about the Fed and favors a dovish stance,â€ said one investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. â€œDovishâ€ is Wall Street lingo for leaning toward keeping interest rates lower. â€œI do like a   rate policy, I must be honest with you,â€ Trump told the Wall Street Journal in response to questions about Yellen. Cohn is Trumpâ€™s chief economic adviser and holds the position of director of the National Economic Council. A lifelong Democrat, Cohn was the number 2 man in charge of Goldman Sachs until he left to join the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is also a Goldman alum and has close ties to Wall Street. Schwarzman is a   friend of Trumpâ€™s and the   of the Blackstone Group, a   Wall Street private equity firm. He reportedly speaks to Trump by phone several times a week and was recently seated beside Trump at a White House gathering of corporate chiefs. Trump also said he no longer opposes the   bank, which he accused of â€œ â€ and called unnecessary during the campaign. â€œIt turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies,â€ Trump told the Wall Street Journal. Around 40 percent of   money is used to subsidize exports from Boeing. Less than 20 percent goes directly to small businesses. The language Trump used, referring to small businesses as â€˜vendorsâ€™ indicates the influence of big businesses that benefit from   subsidies. They have long argued that they pass along subsidies to smaller businesses that manufacture parts for their exports, a   theory of subsidies. â€œ  doesnâ€™t help the economy. It doesnâ€™t drain the swamp,â€ writes     critic Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner. Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, applauded Trumpâ€™s change of heart on  .

20980,"Thousands Flee Parts of Aleppo, Syria, as Assadâ€™s Forces Gain Ground - The New York Times",Hwaida Saad and Nick Cumming-Bruce,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  â€”   The ferocious ground assault and aerial bombardment in eastern Aleppo has forced some 16, 000 people to flee for their lives in the last few days, according to Stephen Oâ€™Brien, the United Nations under secretary general for humanitarian affairs. â€œThe parties to the conflict have shown time and again they are willing to take any action to secure military advantage even if it means killing, maiming or starving civilians into submission in the process,â€ Mr. Oâ€™Brien warned on Tuesday, calling the siege of the city a â€œdeeply alarming and chilling situation. â€ On Monday, forces loyal to President Bashar   captured about a third of the territory in Aleppo that had been held by rebels. Planes have dropped leaflets over the   areas in the eastern part of city. â€œIf you donâ€™t leave these areas quickly you will be annihilated,â€ the leaflets warn. â€œSave yourselves. You know that everyone has left you alone to face your doom and have offered you no help. â€ Hisham   a member of a council of rebels and civilians in eastern Aleppo, said by telephone on Tuesday that warplanes had hovered closely over the area, steadily dropping barrel bombs, as a delegation of civic activists explored the idea of using   safe routes to leave the city, though many were not confident they could escape with their lives. â€œFor the civilians, they have the choice whether they want to leave or stay, but for those of us who donâ€™t trust the regime, we have no choice,â€ he said through tears, adding that he did not want to leave his home. â€œI canâ€™t turn my back on my city. â€ Rami Jarrah, a Syrian   activist and citizen journalist who is based in Turkey but regularly travels to   Aleppo, said via Facebook that he did not believe that there was such a thing as safe passage. Five years into the civil war, he said, many of those remaining in eastern Aleppo are on the Assad governmentâ€™s â€œblack list,â€ having participated in protests or openly defied it. â€œAll have lost loved ones or have family members who are fighting to protect the city,â€ he said. â€œThe Syrian regime does not tolerate any form of opposition to its narrative, and this means that leaving eastern Aleppo through â€˜safeâ€™ passageways that have been set up by Assadâ€™s forces is not an option for the vast majority of the population. â€ He added: â€œSyrians would prefer to live under chaotic bombardment than be apprehended by the Syrian regime and tortured to death. Five years of people staying put even when leaving was the easiest option is sheer proof of this. â€ Around 10, 000 civilians have escaped from the cityâ€™s   east into   western Aleppo, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations emergency relief coordination office, told reporters in Geneva. An additional 4, 000 to 6, 000 have managed to flee to the   Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood on the northern edge of the city, he said. Russian and Syrian television channels showed people who had crossed into government territory cheering and thanking the government and complaining of bad treatment by rebels inside. In the   neighborhood of Bustan   where bombs rained down, Dr. Salem Abdulnasser said the medical center where he worked had notified the staff that it would close on Thursday because it was too dangerous to keep operating. Russia said it would be sending mobile hospitals to Aleppo to assist in the crisis. Russian officials also said that 80, 000 people lived in the districts retaken by the Syrian government and that they were receiving humanitarian aid but there was no footage immediately available of such operations inside the areas until Monday held by rebels. Bassem Ayoub, an activist in eastern Aleppo, said that even those sympathetic to the rebels were on the brink of despair. â€œIâ€™m ready to agree to the regimeâ€™s terms  â€”   whatever they are  â€”   for the sake of stopping the killing,â€ he said. â€œPeople are dying by the hundreds. Everybody is ready to leave. Stop the killing. â€ The United Nations appealed repeatedly for access to deliver food and medical aid to eastern Aleppo and to evacuate the wounded. Jan Egeland, the United Nations special adviser on humanitarian affairs, said last week that Russian officials had agreed verbally, and armed opposition groups in writing, to a   plan submitted this month, but the agencyâ€™s plan had not received backing from Damascus and no further action had followed. United Nations officials also said that indiscriminate shelling of western Aleppo had continued killing and injuring civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure, and had forced about 20, 000 people from their homes. The World Food Program said it was able to supply bread and other rations to community kitchens in western Aleppo, but residents in the eastern parts of the city have had no food distribution for two weeks. â€œItâ€™s really dire,â€ said Bettina Luescher, a spokeswoman for the agency, citing accounts of residents sifting through garbage for something to eat. â€Itâ€™s a   descent into hell,â€ she said. At the same time, about 700, 000 people are trapped in besieged areas in other parts of the country, Mr. Oâ€™Brien said. As in eastern Aleppo, â€œpeople in these besieged areas are trapped, terrified and running out of time,â€ he said."

Ms. Stowell has won six times in a row on taped episodes of the quiz show that began broadcasting last week. Ms. Stowell has developed a fan base like few other contestants. But she is unable to enjoy her performance on TV, or the outpouring of love from â€œJeopardy!â€ watchers. Thatâ€™s because she died on Dec. 5, just over a week before her episodes began showing. She was 41. When the science content developer from Austin, Tex. began recording her episodes on Aug. 31, she had Stage 4 colon cancer, a fact known by only a few of the showâ€™s staff members and the host, Alex Trebek. Her competitors were unaware. The show has not announced how long Ms. Stowellâ€™s streak of victories will continue. A â€œJeopardy!â€ champion continues playing until unseated by a contestant. On Tuesday, she won again, bringing her total prize money to $103, 803. Her boyfriend, Jason Hess, and her relatives Greg Stowell and Carole Stowell said in a statement, â€œCindy came on â€˜Jeopardy!â€™ to play the game she loved, and in doing so, she was able to make a contribution to cancer research in the hopes that no one else would have to go through what she did. â€ The money will go to the Cancer Research Institute, according to KXAN, a TV station in Austin. â€œShe knew she wasnâ€™t going to be around, and so she felt like the best thing she could do was try to help do what she could to help get us to a cure faster,â€ Mr. Hess told the station. After passing an online contestant test early this year, Ms. Stowell was invited to an audition in Oklahoma City. At that point, she reached out to a producer. â€œDo you have any idea how long it typically takes between an   interview and the taping date? I ask because I just found out that I donâ€™t have too much longer to live,â€ she wrote, according to the showâ€™s website. â€œThe doctorâ€™s best guess is about six months,â€ she continued. â€œIf there is the chance that Iâ€™d be able to still tape episodes of â€˜Jeopardy!â€™ if I were selected, Iâ€™d like to do that and donate any winnings to   â€¦     charities involved in cancer research. If it is unlikely that the turnaround time would be that quick, then Iâ€™d like to give up my tryout spot to someone else. â€ A producer told her to go to Oklahoma City for the interview, and if she qualified she would be booked three weeks later, the fastest turnaround possible. She competed on painkillers while fighting a blood infection, according to Mr. Hess. â€œCompeting on â€˜Jeopardy!â€™ was a lifelong dream for Cindy, and weâ€™re glad she was able to do so,â€ Mr. Trebek said in a statement. In her first performance, she won $22, 801, defeating an editor from Vermilion, Ohio, who had won $107, 499 over seven days. She won $8, 199 in her second episode, and on Thursday she came from behind, adding $8, 600 to her   total. While itâ€™s not unusual for the show to establish back stories for the contestants, the viewersâ€™ knowledge of Ms. Stowellâ€™s condition â€œis to share a sad secret with her,â€ Seth Rosenthal wrote at SB Nation. â€œI sit in awe of a brilliant woman earning every last dollar she can for the causes dearest to her building a sum of infinite potential in the face of her own finality,â€ he said. â€œI have never rooted harder for anyone to win anything. â€"

20984,ICE Fights Back Against Fake News on Criminal Alien Arrests,Bob Price,"U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are fighting back against false reports of checkpoints and sweeps during the ongoing operation targeting criminal (ICE) aliens. [â€œReports of ICE checkpoints and sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible,â€ ICE officials wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. â€œThese reports create mass panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger. Any groups falsely reporting such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support. â€  Media outlets have been reporting statements by community activists that appear to be aimed at instilling fear and false information about the ICEâ€™s Operation Crosscheck, a program targeting criminal aliens and those with immigration court removal orders. â€œOur community has seen an increase of ICE activity where we have heard ICE agents are going to peopleâ€™s homes and detaining people,â€ Cristina Jimenez, executive director of United We Dream, said, according to NBCNews. While not speaking directly to the   operation, ICE officials stated, â€œICE regularly conducts targeted enforcement operations during which additional resources and personnel are dedicated to apprehending deportable foreign nationals. All enforcement activities are conducted with the same level of professionalism and respect that ICE officers exhibit every day. â€ â€œThe focus of these operations is no different than the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICEâ€™s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis,â€ the ICE statement concluded. News reports indicate ICE agents have arrested hundreds of criminal aliens over the past few days under this operation. Breitbart Texas reported from Austin, Texas, that 44 criminal aliens had been taken into custody this week. A Texas Congressman, Joaquin Castro ( ) confirmed the arrests were part of Operation Cross Check but questioned the threat posed by those being arrested. â€œI am asking ICE to clarify whether these individuals are in fact dangerous, violent threats to our communities, and not people who are here peacefully raising families and contributing to our state,â€ Castro said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. â€œI will continue to monitor this situation. â€ Austin City Councilman Greg Casar added to the fear and false information about the operation by claiming the enforcement action was retaliation for standing up against President Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration plans. â€œI believe ICE is out in public arresting people in order to retaliate against our community for standing up for our values against people like Abbott and Trump,â€ Councilman Casar posted on Facebook. â€œTrump and his allies will do everything they can to divide Americans, invoke fear in vulnerable neighborhoods, and demonize an entire community of people. â€ Breitbart Californiaâ€™s Michelle Moons reported ICE officials had arrested 160 illegal aliens over the past several days. Department of Homeland Security Spokesperson Gillian Christensen confirmed the arrests as part of a â€œroutineâ€ immigration enforcement action. President pro Tempore of the California State Senate Kevin de Leon also challenged the motivation of the operation and those being targeted for arrest. â€œThere are reports that ICE today executed raids across Southern California,â€ de Leon said via a written statement obtained by Breitbart California. â€œI have asked federal officials to disclose how many children, men, and women they have detained what the processing time will be what the rationale is for their detention and I asked that everyone be offered access to an attorney. â€ These types of   rhetoric comes despite statements from ICE and DHS that the operation is part of a routinely recurring operation targeting criminal aliens.  â€œOur operations are targeted and lead driven, prioritizing individuals who pose a risk to our communities,â€ ICE Spokesperson Virginia Kice told the Los Angeles Times. â€œExamples would include known street gang members, child sex offenders, and deportable foreign nationals with significant drug trafficking convictions. â€ The operation is   in several states. In addition to California and Texas, ICE officials have arrested about 200 people in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, FOX 8 News reported. â€œThese reports show the serious consequences of the presidentâ€™s executive order, which allows all undocumented immigrants to be categorized as criminals and requires increased enforcement in communities, rather than prioritizing dangerous criminals,â€ California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in a statement without supporting her claims. The statement was also reported by Fox 8 News. Democrat leaders like Feinstein and Castro do not appear to have made similar protestations following this same ICE operation in March 2015. During the operation carried out under the Obama Administration, more than 2, 000 criminal aliens were rounded up for deportation in the   Operation Cross Check. â€œThis nationwide operation led to the apprehension of more than 2, 000 convicted criminal aliens who pose the greatest risk to our public safety,â€   Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a press release obtained by Breitbart Texas. â€œToday, communities around the country are safer because of the great work of the men and women of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. â€ A full report on the 2017 Operation Cross Check, planned and scheduled during the Obama Administration, is expected to be released by ICE officials on Monday.

20986,We Will Not Go Gently Into the Night: The Silent Majority Speaks,Jeremiah Johnson,"This article is dedicated to one of our readers, AArizonianâ€¦keep your powder dry, Brother! â€“ JJ 
ReadyNutrition Readers, the title to this piece answers a question posed by the individual that you prevented from reaching the White House, none other than Hillary Rodham Clinton. When asked by Congress whether or not it was actually an anti-Islamic film that prompted the destruction of the American Embassy in Libya, she responded with â€œWhat difference does it make?â€
It made all the difference in the world. Her â€œindifferentâ€ masquerade was a faÃ§ade to cover her wrongdoing: the allowed destruction of an American embassy, and the death of the American Ambassador to Libya and three of his staff. Undoubtedly many of you who took to the polls remembered these events. It made a difference to you, and guess what?
Then you made all of the difference. I stress (as I did with a piece I recently wrote for SHTFplan.com) that the battle was won: Hillary Clinton was prevented from taking the presidency. The war is far from over to restoring our nation to a Constitutional Republic where the governors derive their just powers from the consent of the governedâ€¦thatâ€™s you and Iâ€¦and making things completely right. Nevertheless, we took the first step the other night.
You made all of the difference. You, stalwart patriots and preppers from all walks of life. Think of the greatness of the moment, and the moment is yours. You earned it and youâ€™re still here, still strong, with more hope than you had the day before. Continue the fight and the work. Obama has more than enough time to bring the country down through any sort of false flag or a war (provoked from our direction). For this reason, you must continue to study, to keep informed, to keep preparing for times of trouble.
Even after the Revolutionary War, the country (and our countrymen) did not relax. That musket with the powder and lead balls was required to be in every home, that â€œBrown Bessâ€ hanging over the fireplace. At any given moment we may be called upon to take the same stand that they took. We are called upon to maintain the posture they held with vigilance: to be ready at all times, to defend the home and our country.
You voted and did that the other nightâ€¦took the stand against the tyranny that almost overtook us. Keep in mind how close it came. Clinton won the popular vote and the electoral vote was far from a landslide. We still face another almost three months with Obama in office. So whatâ€™s the point of this piece? The point is to recognize you, our readers, and to tell you that you made a difference last nightâ€¦just as you make a difference here, to us at ReadyNutrition.
At any time can come an EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) attack, from a foreign country either provoked or allowedâ€¦or one carried out by Obama prior to his exit from office. At any time can come a natural disaster or a war. Do not be lulled into a false sense of security. Stay vigilant as our forefathers did. We are on the tail end of 8 years of absolute agony, of destruction to our country. Strong as it was, 8 years was not enough to take it down.
I receive letters from many of you from all across the country. People from near where I live, now, in Montana. People from Ohio in the Mahoning Valley, from the Great Plains of Nebraska, from the Yukon in Alaska, and the Florida Panhandle. I receive letters from Seattle, from Dallas, from New York City, and from Baltimore, where I was born and still call home.
All of these letters have one thing in common: they were written by men and women such as yourselvesâ€¦men and women â€œwho will not go gently into that good nightâ€¦who will not give up without a fight.â€ More than just preppers: survivors, patriots, and Americans. The point to this letter is to salute all of you, our readers, and thank you for being part of the ReadyNutrition family. Thank you for your diligence and efforts as you plan, prepare, and pray. Especially that last part of it.
Because we have to hold the mindset of our forefathers and take an active part to preserve ourselves, our families, and our nation. I salute you, my fellow countrymen! I thank you for your letters and readership, and I thank you for votingâ€¦casting a vote to give usâ€¦our countryâ€¦another chance. Stay vigilant and determined, and take care of one another. These poor words of encouragement, I pray, will be with you that you may know how important you are to Miss Tess and I and all of us here at ReadyNutrition.
For [to paraphrase Frost]: Two paths diverged upon a great nationâ€¦between tyranny and freedomâ€¦and you, the nation took the path of freedomâ€¦.and that made all the difference.
Because you are the difference, and I thank you. May God bless you and your families in all that you do.
Sincerely,
JJ

20987,"Bridgewater, Worldâ€™s Biggest Hedge Fund, Is Said to Be Slowing Hiring - The New York Times",Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein,"After years of rapid internal growth, the worldâ€™s biggest hedge fund appears to be slowing down. The $154 billion hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, run by the billionaire Ray Dalio, is known for hiring hundreds of people every year. Yet it is now telling recruitment firms to cancel interviews with prospective employees, according to three people briefed on the matter. In recent weeks, dozens of interviews were canceled and advanced negotiations with prospective employees were cut short by the firm, those people said. And some of the firmâ€™s external recruiters have been told Bridgewater will not use them for the time being, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Bridgewater emphasizes secrecy in its communication with investors and the external recruiting firms, and the people requested anonymity because they did not want their relationship with the firm to be affected. It was unclear whether the suspension of recruiting in some areas was temporary or a reflection of a new push to gradually shrink the size of the firm. At the moment, there does not appear to be any talk of layoffs. The firm employs 1, 500 people, most of them at its sprawling headquarters in Westport, Conn. Still, the signs of a pullback in recruiting at Bridgewater are emerging at a time when a number of hedge funds, struggling with poor performance and unhappy investors, are starting to cut back. For example, William A. Ackmanâ€™s $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, whose main fund is down 19. 1 percent this year, recently fired a dozen employees. The average hedge fund is up 1. 6 percent this year through the end of June, according to the Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, the broadest gauge of hedge fund performance. By contrast, the Standard  Poorâ€™s   index is up 5. 76 percent. Bridgewater is not immune to the industryâ€™s pressures. It has had uneven performance in its two main portfolio funds, and at least one prominent investor has pulled out a significant sum of money over the last year. The firmâ€™s flagship Pure Alpha fund, which makes broad bets on global economic trends, is down 8. 8 percent, while its All Weather fund, which the firm contends will â€œperform well across all environments,â€ is up 10. 4 percent. But last year, those performances were reversed: The All Weather fund lost investors 6. 9 percent, while Pure Alpha gained 4. 7 percent. Over the last two years, the University of Californiaâ€™s Board of Regents, the endowment for the state university system in California, has withdrawn the $550 million it had invested with Bridgewater. Jagdeep Singh Bachher, the chief investment officer for the University of California regents, said in an interview that Bridgewater made money for the endowment, but that a decision was made to focus on investment strategies that would do best. He also said there were some concerns about the future direction of Bridgewaterâ€™s leadership. It has been a tumultuous year for the firm. Bridgewater publicly prides itself on what it calls â€œradical transparencyâ€ in its dealing with employees, but is very private about discussing its operations. The firm is in the process of reorganizing its core management committee that reports directly to Mr. Dalio, who founded Bridgewater in 1975. This year, Greg Jensen, a   investment officer who was seen as the heir apparent, was removed from his role as   executive after reports of a schism between him and Mr. Dalio. Bridgewater hired Jon Rubinstein, a former Apple executive who had worked closely with Steven P. Jobs, to replace Mr. Jensen. Bridgewater has publicly denied there were any internal rifts. The firm is known for its unusual culture, where employees are encouraged to question and sometimes admonish one another. Mr. Dalio encourages all employees to read â€œPrinciples,â€ a little white book that each is given and that includes 210 motivational tips like, â€œDonâ€™t worry about looking good  â€”   worry about achieving your goals. â€ Publicly, the firm attributed the management   to the need to â€œstrike the right balanceâ€ for Mr. Jensen, who Bridgewater said was balancing too much as both   executive and   investment officer. Mr. Dalio, who is 66, has created a core committee of managers that share top executive positions as part of a transition plan for when he retires. The firm has communicated to investors that the arrangement is part of a â€œplanful transition from a   boutique to a professionally managed institution. â€ Nevertheless, it has worried some investors. â€œThe management transition, in my view, it just didnâ€™t feel smooth,â€ Mr. Bachher, of the University of California regents, said. Despite the management transition and the apparent slowdown in hiring, Bridgewater continues to plan to expand its headquarters. Connecticut has given Bridgewater $22 million in financial aid in an effort to keep the firm from moving its headquarters out of the state. The money is expected to go toward the expansion of Bridgewaterâ€™s complex in Westport as well as its facilities in Wilton and Norwalk, according to the State Bond Commission. Bridgewater recently received tentative approval from Westport town officials for its expansion plan, according to public documents filed in Westportâ€™s town hall. The plans would include the construction of an underground parking garage and another building at the Bridgewater campus at 1 Glendinning Place, the firmâ€™s headquarters tucked away in the woods and surrounded by streams. Its main entrance is accessible by a nondescript road."

Ms. Wright says she managed to get out of the room when the first man unlocked the door to let another man in, but was kicked down the stairs when she attempted to flee. She says a number of men attempted to restrain her as she made for the front door, dragging her back into the house by her hair in the presence of a witness when she got outside. @AMDWaters and Chelsea at todays #JusticeforChelsea ralley in Sunderland! pic. twitter.   â€”   Lucy Brown (@LUCY____BROWN) May 13, 2017,  She was able to escape the house a second time and reach safety, and was examined at a sexual assault clinic the same day.

Chief Inspector Paul Milner described Ms Wright as having woken up â€œin a strange address in Peel Street with cuts and bruisesâ€ near the time of the incident. She describes â€œhorribleâ€ bruises around her groin, â€œwhip marksâ€ across the back of her legs, and her arms being â€œblackâ€ where she had been grabbed by the men, as well as handprints on her neck and a footprint on her back. #justiceforchelsey pic. twitter.   â€”   Tommy Robinson (@TRobinsonNewEra) April 29, 2017,  Robinson appeared to corroborate part of Ms. Wrightâ€™s story speaking to a witness over the phone.

20991,Obamaâ€™s Last Battle: His Legacy - The New York Times,Michael Barbaro,"In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama is waging a final battle  â€”   not over legislation or a Supreme Court seat, but over how he will be remembered. In the latest episode of The   we explore what, exactly, the Obama legacy will be. The president is aggressively telling his version, through a major speech broadcast on   TV, interviews and a forthcoming book. But   Donald J. Trump is telling a very different version, through tweets, speeches and news conferences. Whoâ€™s will win out? I speak with David Leonhardt, an   columnist at The New York Times who chronicled the Obama administration from the start, and Jodi Kantor, a reporter whose book, â€œThe Obamas,â€ was just reissued with a new preface. Our   conversation explores Mr. Obamaâ€™s impact on race, health care, economic inequality and Americaâ€™s place in the world. And we seek to answer a question historians may puzzle over for decades: Just how consequential was this presidency compared with past White Houses? I speak as well to former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts about whether Mr. Obamaâ€™s relationship with Republican lawmakers had to be so adversarial, polarizing and partisan. Who was to blame? Could Mr. Obama have done more to get things done using executive orders? Mr. Frank is blunt. â€œAbsolutely not,â€ he says. â€œYou had a Republican majority in both houses that (A) was determined to undercut him politically and (B) did not care if the government was dysfunctional because they donâ€™t like government anyway.

20992,"Critic of Najib Razak, Malaysian Leader, Gets Prison for 1MDB Disclosure - The New York Times",Richard C. Paddock,"BANGKOK  â€”   An outspoken member of Malaysiaâ€™s Parliament was sentenced on Monday to 18 months in prison for publicly disclosing classified information from an official audit into a   government investment fund. A lower court ruled that the lawmaker, Rafizi Ramli, was guilty of violating the Official Secrets Act by possessing and publicizing information from the document. Mr. Rafizi, who has served in Parliament since 2013, could also lose his seat and be barred from running for office for five years. Rights advocates said the prosecution and conviction of a sitting member of Parliament for speaking publicly was unprecedented and was aimed at silencing one of the governmentâ€™s most vocal critics. â€œThe 18 monthsâ€™ imprisonment sentence can only be described as harsh and excessive, all the more so as Rafizi was merely performing his role as an elected representative,â€ Lawyers for Liberty, a Malaysian human rights organization, said in a statement. â€œThe conviction and sentence will create a dangerous chill on free speech and result in a more repressive, opaque and unaccountable government. â€ Mr. Rafizi, a member of the Peopleâ€™s Justice Party, has been a leading critic of Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is accused of receiving $1 billion from 1 Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, a government investment fund that Mr. Najib established and oversaw. Mr. Najib has said that he never received any money from the fund or took anything for personal gain. The United States Justice Department says that more than $3 billion is missing from the fund and that at least $731 million of it was deposited into the personal bank account of the prime minister, identified as â€œMalaysian Official 1. â€ The Justice Department filed suit in federal court in California in July to recover more than $1 billion in assets that it said were acquired by Mr. Najibâ€™s stepson and close associates in the United States with money stolen from the fund, including   real estate and expensive artwork. The prime minister has held on to power by firing critics within his own party, blocking investigations and suppressing dissent. No one in Malaysia has been prosecuted over the missing money. The government conducted an audit of the investment fund, which it then classified as secret under the Official Secrets Act. Mr. Rafiziâ€™s conviction was based on comments he made at a news conference in March in which he discussed a page of the audit that dealt with the fundâ€™s failure to make payments. Around the time of his sentencing, Mr. Rafizi posted on Twitter: â€œI am not shocked, sad, angry, afraid or anything. No such feelings. Just another day. Been like this. What doesnâ€™t kill u makes u stronger. â€ He did not respond to requests for comment, but associates said they expected him to appeal. Cynthia Gabriel, director of the Center to Combat Corruption  Cronyism, based in Malaysia, questioned the purpose of having an audit if the findings were to be kept secret. â€œThe Official Secrets Act is being used to hide corruption,â€ she said. â€œWe need freedom of information laws to help the public monitor and bring to account powerful politicians and businesses. â€ The prime ministerâ€™s office defended the prosecution of Mr. Rafizi by saying that he broke the law to make a political point and wanted to become a â€œpolitical martyr. â€ â€œHe tried a cheap stunt for personal political gain, but he knowingly committed a serious crime in doing so,â€ said Abdul Rahman Dahlan, a minister in the office. â€œIt is right that he pays the price  â€”   and he has only himself to blame. â€ Opponents of the prime minister plan to hold a rally on Saturday in Kuala Lumpur, the capital. A similar event last year drew as many as 100, 000 people, most wearing yellow   with the slogan, â€œBersih,â€ or â€œcleanâ€ in Malay, despite a government ban on the garments. A court later upheld the prohibition on the grounds that the shirts posed a threat to national security. Maria Chin Abdullah, a leader of the Bersih movement, said the Official Secrets Act gives the prime minister extraordinary power to suppress potentially damaging information. â€œThe act vests vast powers in the hands of the executive to conceal key information from public access and to decide on what constitutes â€˜official secrets,â€™ which cannot be challenged in court on any grounds,â€ she said. Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said the conviction went further than the governmentâ€™s previous steps to block criticism. â€œThis prosecution really is unprecedented because it involves a sitting MP, and the content is the Auditor Generalâ€™s annual report, which prior to this year has regularly been released to the public after being introduced in Parliament,â€ he said."

20994,Bad News For Hillary After Camera Caught Why She Gave Strange Men $300,Amanda Shea,"Bad News For Hillary After Camera Caught Why She Gave Strange Men $300 Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Man from video (left), Hillary Clinton thinking she got away with it (right) 
Hillary Clinton canâ€™t seem to escape the karma thatâ€™s coming her way as the days are dwindling down to the election, and with each one, something else comes out against her that she canâ€™t escape. After the FBI dropped the ball on the first investigation, theyâ€™re redeeming themselves the second time around, and now itâ€™s out what she paid strange men $300 to do. 
The hits just keep on coming at Hillary. If she gets off the hook again this investigation in addition to everything WikiLeaks has released about her, then we know that there is something seriously corrupt with our government. 
Worse yet would be if sheâ€™s elected as president, which will force Americans to pay an exceptionally detrimental price for the next four years that could bring lasting implications. The man in this video knows who may have helped in that destructive outcome, done for a small fee that Hillaryâ€™s campaign evidently handed out like candy for this cause at a halfway house in California. 
MicroSpookyLeaks came forward with the footage they obtained, when they posted it to social media on Saturday which shows the unnamed person in this video admitting what Democrats were giving halfway house patients $300 to do for them. While this man in the video may not have accepted the payment himself, heâ€™s caught saying that Democrats are giving others in the house a $300 rebate check if they vote for Hillary in the state of California. DEMS caught paying patients from a halfway house $300 rebate to vote for HRC in CA! pic.twitter.com/qpxgNt6KgR

This is just one place where cash was probably offered for votes. We can only imagine that if her party is willing to do this there, they hit up other places and people in key states to do the same. Whatâ€™s particular sick about it isnâ€™t just that they are fraudulently obtaining votes for this woman who canâ€™t get them on her own merit, itâ€™s that they are targeting vulnerable people to get them as part of the dishonest plan. 
If Hillary is able to continue on with this campaign and take the White House, Americans have the duty to demand how it happened since thereâ€™s no way she could legitimately win. Had Donald Trump been caught bribing halfway house patients for votes or any of the other dishonest deeds leaked out about Hillary lately, the media would have exiled him from the election."
20995,Another Black Swan Hits the U.S. Presidential Election,Michael Krieger,"at 1:43 pm 3 Comments 
By now, everyone on planet earth has heard about the bombshell news just announced by the FBI that it was re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s private email server. Hereâ€™s the text of FBI head James Comeyâ€™s letter to Congressional leaders. 
Obviously, lots of people are out there pontificating on what, if anything, this means. As such, Iâ€™m going to add my two cents to the conversation. 
Iâ€™ve prided myself on unemotionally calling this election how I see it the whole time, because Iâ€™m neither a Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump supporter. Being free of the tremendous baggage that comes with cheerleading a particular candidate in this contentious election, I had consistently predicted a Trump victory until the Access Hollywood tape emerged. At that point I penned a thought-piece titled, Donald Trump is in Trouble â€“ Part 2 , in which I changed my forecast to a Hillary Clinton victory. 
Hereâ€™s some of what I wrote: 
After watching yesterdayâ€™s audio and reading through the Wikileaks revelations, my prediction has changed for the first time this election. All things equal from here on out (meaning no additional huge revelations against Hillary), I think Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be a landslide, but I think sheâ€™s probably going to win. The audio was very harmful for Donald Trump, and now Iâ€™m going to explain why. 
First of all, if you want to accurately forecast the outcome of this election you need to get into the minds of the masses. Just like trading financial markets, what you think is right doesnâ€™t matter. What matters is what everyone else collectively thinks, and whether or not theyâ€™re going to get off their asses and vote. A big part of why I thought Trump would win related to the fact that I believe many people were simply looking for an excuse to vote for him. Justified disgust with the status quo in general, and Hillary Clinton in particular, pushed millions of Americans into the camp of being willing to take a gamble on Trump despite disliking him personally and disagreeing with him on many issues. I felt strongly that there were millions upon millions of Americans you could place into this category â€” people who were â€œflirting with the idea of voting Trump.â€ I believe a significant amount of these people will not vote for him as a result of the audio. Will it be the majority of them? Probably not, but it will be a material number and arguably enough to swing the election. No, I donâ€™t think these voters will shift to Hillary, and no, I donâ€™t think committed Trump voters will change their minds. However, I do think enough of these willing to be convinced, leaning-Trump types will now stay home or vote third party. Itâ€™s these voters who I expected to swing the election in Trumpâ€™s favor, and they are now unreliable. 
Does Trumpâ€™s vulgarity excuse the incalculable crimes of Hillary Clinton and her husband, making them preferable in this election? No it doesnâ€™t, but thatâ€™s not the point of this article. Most voters are too superficial, too busy trying to survive and too uninformed to weigh all the very important issues rationally. As an example, think about how most conversations are going to go down this weekend. Letâ€™s say youâ€™re out with a bunch of friends for drinks tonight. Someone says, â€œso have you seen the Trump audio?â€ If someone in the group hasnâ€™t, someone will pull out their phone and itâ€™ll be watched in 3 minutes. What if someone then says, â€œyeah, but have you seen the leaked Hillary emails?â€ What will your response be? You canâ€™t adequately explain the importance of that to your friends in 3 minutes. Instead, youâ€™ll have to send them a lengthy article that theyâ€™ll never read. So by the end of this weekend, pretty much everyone in America will have heard the Trump audio, while maybe 10% will take the time to analyze what came out of Wikileaks. There goes your election. 
Understanding the craziness of the election, I finished the piece with the following. 
Despite all of that, I still canâ€™t say with certainty that Hillary will win. However, I do think the landscape has changed enough, that for the first time this entire election season, I am no longer confident of a Trump victory. Then again, I was absolutely convinced that Hillary was unelectable after she collapsed on 9/11 and mislead everyone about her health, and I was wrong about that. Thatâ€™s how completely crazy this election is, and thereâ€™s still a month to go. Anything can happen, particularly with the debate coming up this Sunday. So while itâ€™s certainly not out of the question, there will have to be some very material events over the next month to put Trump back in the driverâ€™s seat. 
While the Wikileaks emails have been an important factor in keeping this race close, I didnâ€™t think they were sufficient to alter my forecast of a Clinton victory. I think the reopening of the FBI investigation is enough of a black swan to materially change the course of this race. 
Clinton supporters will read this and think Iâ€™m insane. They will think this because they are anticipating a landslide victory for Hillary. I never expected a landslide, so I think this news tips the election into a total tossup situation. My reasoning for the change is the same that led me to switch my forecast to Hillary after the Access Hollywood video was released. The primary reason I initially thought Trump would win related to the fact I believed enough people would be willing to vote for a person they donâ€™t really like in order to blow up the status quo. I felt that the video recording of Trumpâ€™s vulgar commentary was enough to put those people into the absentee or third party column, despite millions of Americans looking for an excuse to vote for Trump due to the well understood awfulness of Hillary. This has changed, and voters now have the excuse they needed to vote Trump. 
That reason is simple. The problems with Hillary Clinton will never go away. They will always resurface or new problems will emerge, and it has nothing to do with a â€œvast rightwing conspiracyâ€ (or Putin). It has to do with her. It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks, warmongers, and shameless looters of the American public. This re-opening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone. We know what 4 years of Hillary will look like. Itâ€™ll be Obama cronyism on steroids, plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3. I donâ€™t think people want that, and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Trump. 
As a caveat, the above forecast assumes this new FBI investigation is not closed before November 8th. If it is, I think sheâ€™ll win. If not, I think Trump has even odds to win, if not better. 
Of course, with 11 days left in this crazy election, many more black swans could emerge. Stay tuned.

Dr. Anthony J.Hall is a Professor of Globalization Studies at the in Alberta Canada. Professor Hall is the editor-in-chief of the American Herald Tribune. He is author of several books, including a two-volume publishing project at McGill-Queenâ€™s University Press entitled â€œThe Bowl with One Spoonâ€; American Empire and the Fourth World: The Bowl with One Spoon, Part I (McGill-Queenâ€™s Native and Northern) Earth into Property: Colonization, Decolonization, and Capitalism: The Bowl with One Spoon, Part II (Mcgill-Queenâ€™s Native and Northern Series). The Part II edition was recently selected by The UK Independent as one of the best books of 2010. The Journal of the American Library Association called Earth into Property, â€œA scholarly tour de force.â€ The books aim to set the 9/11 catastrophe and post 9/11 Wars in the context of global history, since 1492. Dr. Hall has been suspended and harshly pulled from his classroom, in mid-term without any process of arbitration: namely, for having expressed his viewpoints on Israeli crimes, calling for an open debate on the Holocaust and 9/11, despite being promoted to a Full Professor rank through a process of peer review. In an exclusive interview with Khamenei.ir Professor Hall elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the West:
Ayatollah Khamenei has stated that â€œgenuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress. In the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere, there can be no opportunity for growth.â€ How do youâ€“ as a Professorâ€“ perceive it?
I reflected very self-consciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country Canada when I opted in the mid to late 1970s to go to graduate school at the University of Toronto. With the great Canadian historian, J.M.S. Careless, as my Ph.D. Supervisor I made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the First Nations of Canada. My course of study took me in 1982 to my first appointment in the Native Studies Department at the University of Sudbury. The University of Sudbury was in those years a Jesuit-run entity. It formed the institutional seed from which the secular Laurentian University would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there.
For the next two decades I was able to work from my academic bases in Sudbury and then in Lethbridge Alberta beginning in 1990. At the invitation of the Leroy Little Bear, the Chair of the Department of Native American Studies I thus moved to the resource-rich province of Alberta. Once again I was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my I could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in Western Canada.
In my years as a young professor I took an active part in four First Nations/First Ministers conferences that took place in Ottawa between 1983 and 1987. The purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase, â€œ the existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.â€ (Section 35, Constitution Act, 1982) .
MORE... The B'nai Brith and the History of the Mounting Assault on Academic Freedom in Canadian Universities Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Section 35 was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over Canadaâ€™s constitutional structure from the British imperial Mother Country to the domestic institutions of Canadian federalism.
The culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a made-in-Canada version of the Canadian constitution involved my opposition between 1987 and 1990 to what became known as the Meech Lake accord. If this political deal between Canadaâ€™s First Ministers had become constitutional law, the First Nations of Canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of Canadaâ€™s â€œfundamental characteristic.â€
In academic essays, in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees, I contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the Meech Lake accord for fair-minded Canadians supportive of existing Aboriginal and treaty rights. More specifically I contributed to the strength of the platform from which an Oji-Cree parliamentarian by the name of Elijah Harper used his veto power in the Manitoba Legislature to block the ratification of the Meech Lake accord. Because of Elijah Harperâ€™s actions the Meech Lake accord did not become part of Canadaâ€™s â€œsupreme law.â€
I was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of Canada until about the year 2000. Between 2000 and 2002 I had to adjust my work away from the activities of the Department of Native American Studies towards a field of my own making, Globalization Studies. I prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role. The core focus of my emphasis on â€œGlobalization Studiesâ€ was Indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from 1492 until the present.
It is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student, Joshua Blakeney, that I began to shift focus towards the treatment of Palestinian and other Arab peoples in the region of Greater Israel, Eretz Israel. It was Joshua who also led me to my first interactions with Iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the New Horizon conference of the autumn of 2014. As I have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me.
Due to the intervention of my colleague, the Mohawk activist Splitting The Sky, I also began to see the events of 9/11 as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twenty-first century.
My quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested. Certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor. Eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my University administration. In 2008 after what I took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member, I resolved that henceforth I would pursue difficult lines of research and publication. I made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action.
I have made no secret of the fact that I see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that Canada is on a downwards spiral. It seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities. If academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning, then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure.
The first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students. They will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power. Our country, Canada, cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions.
Ayatollah Khamenei believes â€œexchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic workâ€; How is this principle practiced at Lethbridge University?
I agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities. I found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues, media and public officials in the years between 1982 and 2001 when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of Canada-First Nations relations.
Unfortunately I would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after 2008 when I began to question the official narrative of what happened on 9/11. Who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the Global War on Terror? As I began to become skeptical of the official narrative I noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest. To put it bluntly, I suppose it became clear to me that, for a number of reasons, it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of 9/11 specifically and false flag terrorism more generally.
As I began to look more deeply into the existing research on 9/11 I was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law. My collaboration with Splitting The Sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former US President, George W. Bush, to give a talk in Calgary in 2009 as his first public engagement as (theoretically) a regular civilian citizen. Our collective action in Calgary in the spring of 2009 led to a trial that we dubbed Splitting The Sky versus George W. Bush . Although I had not yet associated the lies and crimes of 9/11 with Israel First protagonists, I ran into my first Zionist pushback for my 9/11 studies when I presented my essay, â€œShould George W. Bush Be Arrested in Calgary, Alberta, To Be Tried For International Crimes?â€ I originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the University of Winnipeg.
My essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as Splitting The Sky versus George W. Bush . Our stance was that the former US President should have been arrested in Canada for being a credibly-accused war criminal. We were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that Bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against, for instance, prohibited torture. Not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former US President had violated Canadaâ€™s own Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act . The legislation had passed through Parliament with the view that Canada should not become a haven for war criminals.
In pursuing this line of analysis I faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was anti-Semitic.
As I worked on this subject, one that I integrated into my pedagogy, it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victorâ€™s justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy. It seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice. Those on the â€œwinningâ€ side, the stronger side, are invariably held to be above the law.
This line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities. The most fruitful collaboration to develop, however, was that with Dr. Kevin Barrett who had lost his academic position at the University of Wisconsin for incorporating 9/11-related subjects into his research and pedagogy.
For sure I should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of 9/11, the most transformative event of the twenty-first century. In my view the academic institutions in North America and Europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of 9/11. I am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of Islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of Muslim-majority countries.
In a meeting with President Rouhani and his Cabinet, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said: â€œWhen it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of Islam, the West suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression. However, when it comes to the Holocaust, there is no freedom of expression!â€ Why do you think we witness such double standards?
A gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way â€œfreedomâ€ is being defined in the so-called â€œWest.â€ The psychological operations attending the â€œWe Are Charlie Hebdoâ€ ceremonies on Paris in early 2015 epitomized the hypocrisy. The whole essence of this strange event in the city of Lights seemed to signal that â€œfreedom of speech and expressionâ€ in the West is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of Prophet Mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of Islamic religion. The other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on, for instance, the French comedian Mâ€™bala Mâ€™bala DieudonnÃ©. DieudonnÃ© was barred from entering Canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to Jews, Jewish institutions or the activities of Israel these days.
One of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the Bâ€™nai Brith equate my call for open debate on â€œthe holocaust,â€ and indeed open debate on all subjects, as the equivalent of so-called â€œholocaust denial.â€ How many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation? How many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research, teaching and publication?
There is a controversial Quote: from Ayatollah Khamenei in which he saysâ€™ â€œMay God curse all those who put an end to political thoughts, work and endeavor in universitiesâ€. Whatâ€™s your take on that? How essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia?
I agree wholeheartedly with the Supreme Leaderâ€™s observation. One of the great gifts of the Creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality. Our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought, work and endeavor.
This type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression, elaboration, and receptiveness. Indeed we need to make ourselves expert in Universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse. God curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse."

21000,"Music World Bands Together Against YouTube, Seeking Change to Law - The New York Times",Ben Sisario,"A few years ago, the biggest enemy of the music industry was Pandora Media. Then Spotify became the target. Now it is YouTubeâ€™s turn. In recent months, the music world has been united to a rare degree in a public fight against YouTube, accusing the service of paying too little in royalties and asking for changes to the law that allows the company to operate the way it does. The battle highlights the need to capture every dollar as listenersâ€™ habits turn to streaming, as well as the industryâ€™s complicated relationship with YouTube. The dispute has played out in a drumbeat of industry reports, blog posts and opinion columns. Stars like Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams and Billy Joel have signed letters asking for changes to copyright laws. Irving Azoff, the manager of artists like the Eagles and Christina Aguilera, criticized YouTube in an interview and in a fiery speech around the Grammy Awards. Also, annual sales statistics were released showing that YouTube, despite its gigantic audience, produces less direct income for musicians than the niche market of vinyl record sales. â€œThis is the result of an explosion of views of music videos on YouTube against a backdrop of decline in the recorded music business in general,â€ Larry Miller, an associate professor of music business at New York Universityâ€™s Steinhardt School, said of the fight. With more than a billion users, including the youngest and most engaged music fans, YouTube has long been seen by the music business as a vital way to promote songs and hunt for the next star. At the same time, music executives grumble that it has never been a substantial source of revenue and is a vexing outlet for leaks and unauthorized material. It may not be a coincidence that the major record labels are also in the midst of renegotiating their licensing contracts with YouTube this year. In its newest effort, the music industry has asked the federal government to change the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, saying that the law, which was passed in 1998 and protects sites like YouTube that host copyrighted material posted by users, is outdated and makes removing unauthorized content too difficult. Cary Sherman, the chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, says that even when songs are taken down, they can easily be uploaded again. â€œThis is a new form of piracy,â€ he said. â€œYou donâ€™t have to go into dark corners and sell stuff out of your car. You can do it in plain sight and rely on the D. M. C. A. to justify that what youâ€™re doing is perfectly legal. â€ Europeâ€™s copyright protections are also under review, and last month, Andrus Ansip, the European Commissionâ€™s digital chief, called on YouTube to pay more for its content. But so far, YouTube does not seem shaken. In an interview, Robert Kyncl, YouTubeâ€™s chief business officer, said that since its inception in 2005, YouTube has paid $3 billion to the music industry around the world. (In earlier statements, YouTube has said that Google, its parent company, paid that amount across all of its sites, but Mr. Kyncl now says that YouTube alone has contributed that sum and that other Google services have added even more.) â€œMusic matters tremendously to us,â€ Mr. Kyncl said. â€œArtists matter to us. We are connecting artists and fans on our platforms. â€ He also pointed to the siteâ€™s new subscription plan, YouTube Red, and said YouTubeâ€™s copyright protections were functioning as they should. Content ID, the siteâ€™s proprietary system, lets copyright owners keep track of their material, and when the system detects a new video including a tracked song  â€”   whether in a full music video or just the background of a   clip  â€”   the owner can choose to keep the video online or take it down. According to YouTube, 98 percent of copyright claims on its system are made through Content ID, and 99. 5 percent of the claims related to music are handled automatically. YouTube says about half the money it pays in music royalties is related to   videos that incorporate music processed through Content ID. â€œWe are working to create what has become the most significant revenue generator in the entertainment industry,â€ Mr. Kyncl said, â€œwhich is a dual revenue stream where you monetize all people: heavy users through subscription, and light users through advertising. â€ But the music world argues that YouTubeâ€™s financial contributions have not kept pace with the popularity of its streams. In March, the recording industry associationâ€™s annual report of sales statistics, usually a dry financial summary, criticized YouTube harshly. It said that free   sites like it, which let users pick specific songs on demand, paid $385 million to record labels in the United States  â€”   less than the $416 million collected from the sale of just 17 million vinyl records. Spotify paid about $1. 8 billion last year for music licensing and related costs, according to the companyâ€™s annual returns, although the average royalty rates for its free tier are not much different from YouTubeâ€™s, by some estimates. The fight over the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has touched a nerve. The music industry is bracing for what may be a   lobbying battle reminiscent of the one over the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill that was abandoned in 2012 after opposition from technology activists and Internet giants like Google and Wikipedia. The copyright law gives â€œsafe harborâ€ to Internet service providers that host   material. While music groups criticize the law, some legal scholars and policy specialists say any change to it would need to be considered carefully, particularly to preserve protections like fair use. â€œAnything that rewrites the D. M. C. A. isnâ€™t just going to affect YouTube,â€ said James Grimmelmann, a law professor at the University of Maryland. â€œIt is going to affect blogs. It is going to affect fan sites. It is going to affect places for game creators and documentarians and all kinds of others. â€ In December, the United States Copyright Office asked for comments about D. M. C. A. as part of a review of the law, and filings by record companies show how laborious copyright policing can be. Universal Music said that after Taylor Swiftâ€™s album â€œ1989â€ was released in late 2014, the company devoted a team of employees full time to search for unauthorized copies to date, the company said, it has sent 66, 000 takedown notices to various sites about â€œ1989,â€ in addition to 114, 000 blocks on YouTube made automatically through Content ID. Maria Schneider, a   jazz composer, said in an interview that the problem was particularly acute for independent acts like her, who do not have Content ID accounts, and that the D. M. C. A.â€™s takedown process discouraged lawful requests. YouTube says that about 8, 000 companies and organizations have access to Content IDand that independents may get access through affiliated companies and industry groups. Mr. Kyncl said the steps in the takedown process were meant to ensure the accuracy of requests and deter false claims. Mr. Azoff said that after the Copyright Office made its request, he and other managers asked artists they represented whether they wanted to sign a letter calling for changes to the law. â€œNot one artist declined,â€ he said. â€œBut if there are creators who like their music on YouTube and SoundCloud, thatâ€™s fine,â€ Mr. Azoff said. â€œThe whole point is choice: Artists should be able to choose. â€"
21002,"Orlando Gunman Used Assault Rifle With Military Roots, Police Say - The New York Times",C. J. Chivers,"A firearm that the authorities said was used on Sunday in a mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla. is a descendant of one of the worldâ€™s most widely distributed and familiar infantry weapons, and a type of rifle that has been involved in previous mass shootings in the United States. Chief John Mina of the Orlando Police Department said the gunmanâ€™s weapons included a handgun and an â€œ   assault rifle. â€ The first   were designed in the 1950s by Eugene M. Stoner, a Marine and inventor, who developed the weapon to military standards and for military service. It was an atypical rifle for its time, seemingly futuristic, and made partly with lightweight plastics and aluminum that traditionalists scorned. It fired a     bullet  â€”   a . 223  â€”   that was also considered revolutionary. The rifle was capable, via a selector lever, of semiautomatic or automatic fire. In the 1960s, under Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, the Pentagon bought vast quantities of the rifle, calling it the   for American ground troops in Vietnam. The  â€™s firepower and reputation for lethality were necessary, in Mr. McNamaraâ€™s view, to counter the Kalashnikov assault rifles carried by the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong. In this way, the   and the Kalashnikov became a related pair, the assault rifle of the West springing into service as a response to the more widely distributed assault rifle of the East. A   later,   and   are made in varied forms by multiple manufacturers, and updated versions, including the   carbine, remain the standard   weapon for most American service members and many allies. Civilian versions have many trade and model names, but are generally referred to as   although this name is a rough description and does not indicate whether a particular specimen of the rifle is capable of both semiautomatic fire and automatic fire, or is semiautomatic only. The police have not said whether the weapon recovered in Orlando was capable of automatic fire. Such questions are politically contentious, although depending on a shooterâ€™s skill and the situation, they can sometimes be moot, as aimed semiautomatic fire from a competent shooter can be far more dangerous than automatic fire, which is harder to control and is often inaccurate.   that fire only on semiautomatic are generally legal in the United States, and are widely owned by   enthusiasts. They are also sometimes used in crimes, and have been involved in some of the most deadly mass shootings in American history, including the massacre in December in San Bernardino, Calif. which killed 14 people, and the attack in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. which killed 26 people, 20 of them children. (That gunman also killed his mother at home before driving to the school.) The  â€™s once unfamiliar caliber  â€”   commonly called 5.   â€”   also evolved into a military standard. The    combination can cause serious wounds, though the damage is determined partly by the type of bullet fired. Investigators in Orlando have yet to provide details on the bullets that were fired in the attack."

Anti-Trump protests broke out shortly after the presidential results were in, but progressives need a more comprehensive and thoughtful approach to the next four years, says Sam Husseini. 
By Sam Husseini 
Two views seem to be dominant among progressives regarding Donald Trump: Either protest all he does (people have been holding â€œanti-Trumpâ€ rallies for the past week) or â€œgive him a chanceâ€ (letâ€™s see what he does, maybe it will be okay). But both the demonizers and those urging a passive approach are wrong. 
The â€œAnti-Trumpâ€ approach is hollow. First, to protest a person is dubious. Too often, â€œprogressivesâ€ have focused on the personal rather than the policies and actions. Remember â€œAnybody But Bushâ€? Thatâ€™s not a particularly uplifting way of approaching things and doesnâ€™t lead to genuinely positive outcomes. Also, Trump is someone who has said a lot of contradictory things. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in an MSNBC interview. 
So, you can certainly talk about rights for immigrants or womenâ€™s rights or ensuring that anti-Muslim policies do not escalate. But to say â€œanti-Trumpâ€ or to ignore good things that Trump has said is hollow. And, yes, there are good things heâ€™s said. For example, during the primaries, he denounced the â€œregime changeâ€ wars waged by George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: 
â€œWeâ€™ve spent $4 trillion trying to topple various people that frankly, if they were there and if we couldâ€™ve spent that $4 trillion in the United States to fix our roads, our bridges, and all of the other problems; our airports and all of the other problems weâ€™ve had, we wouldâ€™ve been a lot better off. I can tell you that right now.â€ 
But it also doesnâ€™t make sense to say â€œletâ€™s see what he does.â€ To stand aside is to allow Trump to be cutting deals with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will doubtlessly work to take away what populist, anti-interventionist and pro-working-class instincts Trump might otherwise follow. 
Bernie Sanders has in recent days struck a reasonable tone at times. In this interview and in a statement just after the election, he said: â€œDonald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. â€¦ To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.â€ 
That seems like a reasonable approach although the major problem with what Sanders says is that it ignores foreign policy, a longstanding problem with Sanders. 
But others are addressing foreign policy: Rand Paul is right to press: â€œ Will Donald Trump betray voters by hiring John Bolton? â€ Diana Johnston at CounterPunch wrote: â€œ After the Election: Donâ€™t Panic, Think! â€ 
Left-Right Alliances 
One possible opportunity is for progressives to be forging left-right alliances , as Sanders alludes to above. Indeed, the senatorâ€™s biographer, Greg Guma, notes that Sanders has done that in the past at times: Sen. Bernie Sanders speaking to one of his large crowds of supporters. (Photo credit: Sanders campaign) 
â€œOne unusual aspect of Bernieâ€™s approach in Congress has been to wage congressional battles with people whose stands on other issues he abhors. In fact, much of Bernieâ€™s legislative success has come through forging deals with ideological opposites. An amendment to bar spending in support of defense contractor mergers, for example, was pushed through with the aid of Chris Smith, a prominent opponent of abortion. John Kasich â€¦ helped him phase out risk insurance for foreign investments. 
â€œAnd it was a â€˜left-right coalitionâ€™ he helped create that derailed â€˜fast trackâ€™ legislation on international agreements pushed by Bill Clinton. The power of that strategy may have reached its apex in May 2010 when Bernieâ€™s campaign to bring transparency to the Federal Reserve resulted in a 96-0 Senate vote on his amendment to audit the Fed and conduct a General Accounting Office audit of possible conflicts of interest in loans to unknown banks.â€ 
In fact, if such a right-left approach isnâ€™t followed now, Trump will likely be forging alliances with Ryan and McConnell . In other words, the path ahead for construction policies may be narrow, but it holds the best hope for the next four years. That strategy calls for attacking Trump when he fails his populist promises but working with him when he pursues them. 
This approach also would likely strengthen populist elements within the Democratic Party and may lead to a de facto realignment of U.S. politics. It may be less glamorous than resisting and filibustering, which may be needed on some issues, but finding constructive overlaps might actually fix some things that need fixing. 
Last year, in a piece entitled â€œ In Defence of the Rise of Trump â€œ, I wrote: 
â€œ[Trump] might pursue the same old establishment policies if he were ever to get into office â€” thatâ€™s largely what Obama has done, especially on foreign policy. Trump says, â€˜I was a member of the establishment seven months ago.â€™ 
â€œThe point is that the natives are restless. And they should be. Itâ€™s an important time to engage them so they stay restless and funnel that energy to constructive use, not demonize or tune them out.â€ 
Demonizing Trump supporters has proved disastrous. Itâ€™s time for another approach by progressives: engagement.

21010,Trump Joins Line of Critics of Costly Fighter Jet - The New York Times,"Michael D. Shear, Christopher Drew and Isabel Kershner","WASHINGTON  â€”     Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the cost of building the militaryâ€™s   fighter jet, the   Joint Strike Fighter, had spiraled â€œout of control,â€ and he vowed to save billions of dollars on military programs once he enters office next month. In a Twitter post on Monday morning and a series of comments since last week, the   assailed cost overruns for the Lockheed   fighter jet that have pushed the projectâ€™s cost beyond $400 billion, making the plane the most expensive weapons system in military history. â€œThe   program and cost is out of control,â€ Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post just before 8:30 a. m. â€œBillions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. â€ Mr. Trumpâ€™s verbal assault on the   continued a pattern in which the   has targeted businesses for criticism and threatened presidential action. Since winning the election, he has challenged Boeing to lower the cost of upgrades to Air Force One, stepped in to stop Carrier from sending jobs to Mexico and taken credit for billions of dollars in investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. But in pursuing the   program, Mr. Trump may be facing a target that even he cannot budge. The   is just the latest in a long line of critics in both parties who have beat up on the   project, only to see it survive thanks to deep political support across the country. Lockheed has spread work on the   to hundreds of subcontractors in most of the 50 states, and members of Congress typically oppose any cuts that would cost jobs in their states or districts. It is unclear what alternative the   could embrace if the military turns away from the   this late in the jetâ€™s development the government has spent about $100 billion on the project, and 204 planes have been built. The Pentagon, under Robert M. Gates, the secretary of defense from 2006 to 2011, canceled a different fighter jet, the   leaving nothing but the   to replace aging fighters used by the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines. Once in office, Mr. Trump could try to shrink overall costs by trimming back plans to buy more than 2, 400 planes. But doing so simply pushes up the price of each jet. And that in turn could provoke diplomatic incidents with American allies who have contracted to add   to their militaries. Higher costs per plane could exceed their budgets, as well. In the end, Mr. Trumpâ€™s public criticism of the plane may be about sending a warning message to private companies that contract with the military. While Mr. Trump said throughout the campaign that he would rebuild the nationâ€™s military, his Twitter post on Monday signaled to contractors that they should not try to fleece the federal government. The immediate impact of Mr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter post on Monday was financial: After it was published, shares of Lockheed Martin had fallen by 4 percent around midday, reducing the companyâ€™s market value by about $4 billion, before rebounding somewhat. Lockheed shares ended the day down about 2. 5 percent, closing at $253. 11 a share. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter just as Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was in Israel to welcome the arrival of two   the first of a   fleet meant to help maintain Israelâ€™s air superiority in the region. Speaking at the ceremony, Mr. Carter described the   as â€œthe most advanced aircraft in historyâ€ and said, â€œIsrael is our first and only friend in the region that is flyingâ€ it. Lockheed Martinâ€™s program manager for the   Jeff A. Babione, who was also in Israel for the planesâ€™ arrival, said, â€œI certainly welcome the opportunity to address any question the   would have about the program. â€ Mr. Babione added that Lockheed had invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane. Lockheed said that if the government stuck to plans to increase production, it could reduce the average price for each   by 2020 to $85 million, about the same as less sophisticated fighters cost. The   was designed as a     aircraft for all of the branches of the United States military, with the goal of overwhelming adversaries with technological superiority. The jet would be able to evade radar and dodge sophisticated antiaircraft missiles while giving pilots a better picture of enemy threats advancing toward them. But despite initial promises that the    plane would save taxpayer money, costs have veered sharply higher over 15 years of development. Mr. Trump has not said how he will seize control of the projectâ€™s costs, which have risen despite repeated attempts over more than a decade to restrain spending and fix costly mistakes. In an interview on Sunday, and in a speech to supporters in Michigan on Friday, the   accused military officials of failing to negotiate good deals with   contractors because they know they might be hired by the companies after their military service ends. â€œThe people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies,â€ Mr. Trump said on â€œFox News Sunday. â€ â€œYou know, they make a deal like that, and two or three years later, you see them working for these companies that made the deal. â€ Mr. Trump said military officials who were in charge of negotiating   deals like the   project should be barred for life from employment with the companies that they worked with, though he did not cite any examples involving the fighter plane. That would be an expansion of the  â€™s proposal that people who work for his administration be barred from lobbying for five years. In a hearing this year, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, demonstrated the dilemma for members of Congress and others who worry about the ballooning cost of the project. He hailed the plane as a needed part of the countryâ€™s arsenal even as he criticized the programâ€™s inability to deliver on time and within budget. â€œThe full capabilities this aircraft will eventually provide are critical to Americaâ€™s national security,â€ Mr. McCain said. â€œBut at the same time, the   programâ€™s record of performance has been both a scandal and a tragedy. â€ The technology in the   and other weapons systems is increasingly complex, and politics tend to exacerbate the problems. To lock in congressional support, the Pentagon often starts building the weapons before testing is complete. Cutting funding in the middle of programs can increase costs in the long run if it reduces the economies of scale in the manufacturing plants. Pentagon officials said recently that they needed an extra $500 million to finish development of the planes. They have also been wrangling with Lockheed over the price of the latest batch of planes. The   program is also sensitive diplomatically, and as costs per plane increase, the overruns affect the ability of other countries to buy the jets. Israel, for example, has ordered 33 of the stealth fighters at a cost of more than $5. 5 billion, to come from the assistance Israel receives from Washington, and the Israeli cabinet decided recently to increase the number of planes to 50."
21011,"Bernie Promises To Keep Fighting, Hold Clinton Accountable After Sheâ€™s Elected (VIDEO)",Richard Marcil,"Bernie Promises To Keep Fighting, Hold Clinton Accountable After Sheâ€™s Elected (VIDEO) By Richard Marcil   
Bernie Sanders is lending his full support to Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton â€“ for now. But how long will he and Clinton remain allies? 
In a new interview , Sanders said he plans on extending his political revolution. He also intends to hold Clinton â€“ who is expected to win the presidential election next month â€“ to her campaign promises. The Primary and the Platform 
The Vermont senator put up a long and contentious fight against Clinton during the primary season, capturing 22 states and over 13 million votes. His populist message and democratic socialist platform proved especially popular among Millennials. 
After the primary season ended, Sanders and his cohorts were able to channel his popularity into the most progressive Democratic Party platform in history. The new platform includes support for a $15 minimum wage, aggressive action on climate change, and the dissolution of banks deemed â€œtoo big to failâ€ â€“ all of which were cornerstone issues in Sandersâ€™ campaign. Still Fighting 
Now an independent, Sanders has pledged to continue working to ensure Clinton and Congress act on the new platform. â€œI expect her to appoint people who will head agencies in a way that is consistent with the Democratic Party platform, and if not, I will do my best to oppose those nominees.â€ 
Clinton did not embrace many of the platformâ€™s elements in her primary campaign, but has since expressed her support for them. Now Sanders and other senators are brainstorming legislation to ensure progressive policies are enacted in Washington. Elizabeth Warren, another darling of the modern progressive movement, has been â€œinformallyâ€ working with Sanders on this legislation. Reining in Wall Street 
Specifically, he expects that Clinton will close the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. â€œI personally believe that a billionaire corporate executive is frankly not the kind of person that working families want to see as secretary of treasury. We need somebody who has a history of standing up to Wall Street and is prepared to take on the financial interests whose greed and illegal behavior has done so much harm.â€ No Compromise 
Sanders also expects that Clinton will not try to placate Republicans in an effort to bridge the political divide. Barack Obama made that mistake when he was inaugurated in 2008, and only ended up with even steeper opposition to his plans and policies. Sanders said: â€œItâ€™s not good enough for me, or anybody, to say, â€˜Well, look, Republicans control the House: From Day One, weâ€™re going to have to compromise.â€™ The Democratic Party, before they start compromising, has got to rally the American people around our ideas and make it clear that if Republicans do not go along with reasonable ideas to benefit the middle class and the working class, they are going to pay a very heavy political price.â€ 
And if Clinton doesnâ€™t follow through on Democratic platform policies and a progressive agenda? â€œI will be vigorously in opposition, and I will make that very clear.â€

Player Joe McKnight - The New York Times",Daniel Victor,"A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr. on Thursday in the fatal  shooting of the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight, handing down a   murder charge. The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December, when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation. If convicted, Mr. Gasser, 54, would face life in prison with no parole. The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs in the N. F. L. spurred several days of protests. Supporters and Mr. McKnightâ€™s former teammates were outraged after the police initially freed Mr. Gasser. Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1, he was not arrested and charged until four days later. Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a â€œroad rageâ€ confrontation in Terrytown, La. about five miles southeast of New Orleans. â€œSubsequent to that arrest, the Jefferson Parish Sheriffâ€™s Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorneyâ€™s Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case,â€ the district attorneyâ€™s office said in a statement Thursday. â€œTodayâ€™s indictment comes as a result of that joint effort. â€ Mr. Gasserâ€™s bond was also increased to $750, 000. The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics, who said that Mr. Gasser, the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, may have been afforded more leeway because he is white, or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black manâ€™s death. In a fiery response after the initial arrest, Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish defended the pace of the investigation, saying the authorities needed time to build a better case in a state that has strong Stand Your Ground   laws. Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December. â€œJustice has no time period,â€ he said. â€œJustice is not a sprint. It is a marathon. These investigations are marathons. â€ The confrontation began around 2:45 p. m. after both men were driving erratically, cutting each other off and zipping in front of each other, Sheriff Normand said. Mr. Gasser became irate and engaged in a â€œverbal altercationâ€ with Mr. McKnight, the sheriff said. When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached the window of Mr. Gasserâ€™s car, the sheriff said. Mr. Gasser then pulled out a handgun from between his seat and the console and shot Mr. McKnight three times, according to the sheriff."
21014,Living in a 5G World: Wireless Pollution is Getting Out of Control,Lynne Wycherley,"Email 
In Drowning in a Sea of Microwaves , the late geneticist Dr Mae-Wan Ho â€“ a visionary voice who opposed GMOs â€“ identified pollution from wireless technologies as a pressing issue of our times. 
Noting evidence for â€œDNA damage â€¦ cancers, microwave sickness, [and], impairment of fertilityâ€, she concluded: â€œEvidence is emerging that the health hazards associated with wireless microwaves are at least comparable to, if not worse than, those associated with cigarette smoking.â€ 
Since the advent of radar, followed by mobile phones and dense WiFi networks, such anthropogenic radiation has sky-rocketed. Although it is non-ionising, and does not destabilise molecules directly, evidence of other harm has been growing since 1950s studies on radar workers. 
According to the updated Bio-initiative Report (2012+) by 29 precautionary scientists, effects on biology feature in several thousand, peer-reviewed papers. Yet troubling new findings rarely filter into the media. Or global Green discourse. 
Though many studies have reported â€˜no significant effectâ€™, research by University of Washington biology professor Henry Lai, and others, reveals that wireless-industry funding is far more likely to yield such findings. 
â€œToujours ils crÃ©ent doubteâ€ (â€˜they are forever creating doubtâ€™), explains former Luxembourg Green MP Jean Huss, whose research on the wireless industry inspired the Council of Europe to call for many precautions (2011), including protection of warning scientists, and wired internet in schools. 
But wireless-product marketing has a loud voice. Few of us realise that genetic effects and free radical damage â€“ both disease risks over time â€“ are the most common, cautionary findings. Device-crowded spaces, such as our peak commuter trains or all-wireless classrooms, may be creating a subtly toxic environment. 
Wide-ranging, oxidative harm to animals has been found from WiFi sources. And linked pre-diabetic and pre-cancerous changes. Ground-breaking work by biochemistry professor Martin Pall , Washington State University â€“ winner of eight international awards â€“ reveals a viable mechanism for such harm. But as with other â€˜inconvenient truthsâ€™, it is going unheard. 
Bee-whispers: the sensitivity of life on Earth 
Lifeâ€™s exquisite electro-physiology is still being discovered. Researchers at Bristol University reported in May that beesâ€™ hairs are highly sensitive to flowersâ€™ delicate EMFs. In controlled trials in Switzerland, bees reacted to mobile-phone signals with high-pitched â€˜pipingâ€™: a cue to desert a hive. 
Other studies show that mitochondria , the tiny power houses in our cells, are at risk from our new EMFs. And that even DNA , in its delicate antenna-like structure, may be frequency-sensitive. 
The long-term, ecological implications of our new, anthropogenic radiation are not known. But peer-reviewed studies revealing harm to birds , tadpoles , trees , other plants , insects, rodents and livestock , offer clues. 
Biology professor Lukas Margaritis, at Athens University, for example, uncovered harm to fruit flies from just a few minutesâ€™ exposure to our everyday wireless devices, including cordless phones, Bluetooth, and even digital baby monitors. Reviewing research, Indiaâ€™s Ministry of Environment and Forests warned that sensitive habitats may need some protection. 
The UKâ€™s Digital Economy Bill , about to receive its final seal, has sensible proposals for increasing country-wide access to fibre broadband: a technology that does not, in itself, stoke microwave pollution, though wireless add-ons do so. But probe beyond the bill to Ofcomâ€™s 5G consultations, and new EMF exposures emerge: part of global trend. 
The worldwide rush towards 5G or â€˜fifth generationâ€™ wireless rollouts is set to raise our pulsing pollution to new levels. Untested, high microwave frequencies are being lined up to increase bandwidth, automation, and usage â€“ at great profit to the industry. 
These millimetre and centimetre waves, though too weak to heat us, may pose possible risks to our skin, and deeper surface tissue, including that of plants. High-density transmitters are envisaged. A troubling prospect for the many hundreds of patients seen by professor Dominique Belpomme â€˜s clinic in Paris: patients whose disabling symptoms from wireless technologies are supported by new brain scans and blood tests . 
A delegation of scientists have petitioned for such electrosensitivity to be recognised as an environmentally-induced illness , with an International Disease Code (2015). 
Rip-tides: when profits outpace caution 
Pushing for fast rollouts, the wireless industry is also in conflict with the Internatonal EMF Scientistsâ€™ Appeal to the United Nations. Signed by 223 scientists from 41 nations, it calls for remedial action â€“ such as new safety limits, wave-free zones, and education of doctors â€“ to protect our DNA, fertility, and nervous systems, plus children and pregnant women, from growing wireless exposure. And from rising, mains-electricity fields. 
Signs that such caution may be needed are growing. The pulsed, polarized , microwaves used by wireless technologies pose more biological risks than smooth or natural waves. Weak millimetre waves have a known potential to increase antibiotic resistance : what ecological effects might they risk, perhaps, if used universally? 
Studies also reveal a risk to skin pain receptors . Published associations between radio â€“ masts and skin cancers, though at lower frequencies, plus mobile-phone masts and EMF-sensitive cancers (Adilza Dode, Minas Gerais University 2013), raise further questions. 
In his summer press conference, Tom Wheeler â€“ former head of the CTIA, the vast telecoms lobby- group, and controversial chair of the Federal Communications Commission â€“ proposed unbridled â€œmassive deploymentâ€ of commercial 5G transmitters, taking off in 2020. 
Anticipating â€œtens of billions of dollarsâ€ of economic growth, with US telecoms â€œfirst out of the gateâ€, he warned â€œStay out of the way of technological development! Turning innovation loose is far preferable to expecting â€¦ regulators to define the futureâ€. 
With no mention of health-testing, carbon costs, or corporate responsibility, the FCC voted unaminously to go ahead by releasing swathes of untested high frequencies for private sector exploitation â€“ so setting a trend. To questionable ends: added to other issues, how will our communities be affected by addiction to 5G multi-stream videos? How will it impact our spiritual communion with Nature? 
Many American health activists, and cautioning scientists, are aghast. Dr Joel Moskowitz, director of community health studies at the University of California, warns â€œprecaution is warranted before 5G is unleashed on the worldâ€. 
Former government physicist Dr Ron Powell points out the plans â€œwould irradiate everyone, including the most vulnerable to harm from radiofrequency radiation: pregnant women, unborn children, young childrenâ€¦the elderly, the disabled, and the chronically illâ€¦ It would set a goal of irradiating all environmentsâ€. 
Fracking the air? Fault-lines in safety 
This drive to mine the electromagnetic spectrum come-what-may has echoes of fracking, and other headlong trends. In Captured Agency , the Harvard ethics report on the FCC, and the wider wireless industry, Norm Alster exposes ruthless â€œhardball tacticsâ€, supported by â€œarmies of lawyersâ€, at expense to our health. 
Microwaves, Science and Lies (2014), filmed by Jean HÃªches across Europe, exposes similar patterns that are driving our pulsed radiation to risky levels. Western â€œsafety limitsâ€, based only on high levels that heat tissue, far exceed those of Russia , China, and some other nations. 
Professor Yuri Grigoriev , long-serving chair of Russiaâ€™s non-ionising radiation protection body (RNCNIRP), warned the UKâ€™s Radiation Research Trust â€œionising radiation is monitoredâ€¦[but] levels of non-ionising radiation are constantly increasing and ubiquitous: it is out of control â€¦ Urgent action is neededâ€. 
Stealthy pollution-raisers, such as the 5G Internet of Things â€“ with 30 billion tiny transmitters forecast for 2020 â€“ and also, sadly, wireless smart-meters [ 1 , 2 *], vetoed by the American Academy of Environmental Medicine , may run counter to a cherished Green goal: that of nurturing healthy environments. 
Can we manage our energy, perhaps, in more bio-sensitive ways? Court claims for wireless-meter health harm, supported by medical testimonies â€“ including by neurology professor Andrew Marino (Louisiana) â€“ are sweeping America. Professor Pall explains such metersâ€™ â€œhigh intensityâ€ microwave pulses may be more toxic than we realise: â€œWe know from the nanosecond studies these can be very damagingâ€. 
Data obtained by a judge revealed all-hour, house-piercing pulses every few seconds. New data-over-wiring innovations (if free of â€œdirty electricityâ€) may offer inspiring, alternative ways forward. 
Chrysalis: a paradigm in waiting 
To create â€“ in Wheelerâ€™s phrase â€“ a global â€˜5G ecosystemâ€™ of wireless super-saturated environments, at insidious risk, over time, to living ecosystems, not least our own bodies, is dysfunctional. And spiritually disturbing. It suggests a mindset deeply at odds with the orchid-like beauty of the Earth. 
But cleaner innovations, such as LiFi , â€˜eco-dect-plusâ€™ phones, and the latest fibre-optics, suggest a wiser course. A new paradigm â€“ safer connectivity, plus more balanced use â€“ is emerging. And reminds of other step-changes in awareness. From pesticides to organic, from smoke-filled to smoke-free. 
We can accede, if we wish, to our rising, planetary smog. To safety limits as high as the moon, in many scientistsâ€™ eyes. And to wireless rolloutsâ€™ growing carbon costs. Or taking pause, we may begin to call the industry to account â€“ plus governments lulled by it. 
We may air helpful new findings, such as risks from tablet-like exposures ( Alexander Lerchl , Jacob Bremens University, 2015). And stark risks from passive exposure, bared by Leif Salford , medical professor at Lund University. We may defend DNA, if we wish, from ionizing and published non-ionizing risks , just as we defend our planet. 
And alongside French Green Party MPs Laurence Abeille and MichÃ¨le Rivasi , plus the interntional Baubiologie movement, we can explore electromagnetic hygiene. Uplifting possibilities for a safer, cleaner world.

Record numbers of Trump supporters are turning out in their droves to vote for the Republican nominee in Texas. 
According to Sid Miller, Texas Agriculture Commissioner, a huge surge of Republican voters are turning up to vote for Trump for President in the Lone Star State. 
According to a Wednesday Fox News interview, Miller says that record numbers of people are turning up on the first and second day of voting in Texas, eager to ensure that Hillary Clinton doesnâ€™t get into the White House. 
Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Sid Miller : We have a record number of people registered to vote in Texas. Weâ€™re having record turnouts, the first day, the second day of voting. And itâ€™s not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support Hillary. Itâ€™s not Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary. Itâ€™s a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote. Many who have not voted in eight or ten elections so theyâ€™re not reported in the pollsâ€¦ â€¦I know for a fact that the polls are off because they oversample Democrats by eight sometimes up to sixteen percent oversampling Democrats. Theyâ€™re oversampling women by five to eight percent. So the Republican vote is underreported. Plus there is no way to sample this extra twenty to twenty-five percent of new voters that are Trump voters. Theyâ€™re not Republican, theyâ€™re not Democrats, theyâ€™re pragmatists. Theyâ€™re tired of the status quo and they want change. YUGE RECORD BREAKING VOTES in TEXAS!!! & Its Not Bernie Fans or Obama Voters for Hillary Clinton!!

Given the Russiansâ€™ recent threats regarding the potential election of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, this is not good news. 
â€œAmericans voting for a president on Nov. 8 must realize that they are voting for peace on Planet Earth if they vote for Trump,â€ veteran Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky said earlier this month, according to Reuters .   
â€œBut if they vote for Hillary, itâ€™s war,â€ he continued. â€œIt will be a short movie. There will be Hiroshimas and Nagasakis everywhere.â€ 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has himself reportedly also made threats, warning of a potential â€œconfrontationâ€ were Clinton to continue prodding Russia with allegations that it has been attempting to rig the U.S. presidential election. 
â€œJeopardizing Russian-American relations in order to gain brownie points internally â€” I consider this to be harmful and counterproductive,â€ Putin reportedly said this week. â€œItâ€™s not funny anymore.

21017,Donald Trump Rips Media for â€™Wrongâ€™ Russia Meeting Report: â€™Never Mentioned the Word Israelâ€™,Aaron Klein,"JERUSALEM  â€”   President Donald Trump on Monday told reporters here that he â€œnever mentionedâ€ Israel during a White House meeting two weeks ago with Russian officials. [He went on to accuse the news media of getting the story wrong.  Trump was referring to a news making New York Times report quoting a â€œcurrent and a former American officialâ€ claiming it was Israel that provided alleged classified intelligence purportedly disclosed by Trump to Russian officials during the recent meeting.  â€œJust so you understand, I never mentioned the word or the name â€˜Israel,â€™â€ Trump told reporters here after making brief statements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. â€œNever mentioned it during the conversation [with the Russians]. â€ â€œTheyâ€™re all saying I did, so you have another story wrong,â€ he said to the assembled reporters. â€œNever mentioned the word Israel. â€ Trump was speaking spontaneously after reporters shouted questions at him at the conclusion of a joint statement with Netanyahu.  The Israeli prime minister referred to U. S.  security cooperation as â€œterrific. â€ The Times report did not claim that Trump disclosed to the Russians that Israel was allegedly the source of the information purported to be about the inner workings of the Islamic State as reportedly discussed with the Russians. The Timesâ€™ claim followed a Washington Post exclusive that first reported the purported classified information was allegedly revealed by Trump during a meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador.  The Post report cited â€œcurrent and former U. S. officials. â€ Indeed, it was the Times that first outed Israel as the alleged source of the information. The Timesâ€™ article failed to note its own report, if accurate, could endanger Israelâ€™s antiterrorism intelligence collection operations. The Post article acknowledged that as president â€œTrump has broad authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law. â€ The Times cited Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, as telling reporters that Trump was not aware of the source of the information. Israeli officials reached by the Times would not confirm that Israel provided the intelligence, which reportedly concerns the inner workings of the Islamic State. McMaster told the Post that â€œthe president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation. â€ â€œAt no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly,â€ McMaster stated. Later, McMaster stated the leak may put U. S. national security at risk. â€œI think national security is put at risk by this leak and by leaks like this,â€ he said. â€œAnd there are a number of instances where this has occurred and I think itâ€™s important to investigate these sort of things. â€ Trump tweeted he has the â€œabsolute rightâ€ as president to share information. As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W. H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining  â€¦    .  â€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017,  The Post claimed the information was provided through an unnamed U. S. ally: The information the president relayed had been provided by a U. S. partner through an   arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U. S. government, officials said. The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trumpâ€™s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. The Times outed that ally as Israel, citing a â€œcurrent and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information. â€ In January, Israelâ€™s respected Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported U. S. intelligence officials from the Obama administration warned their Israeli counterparts not to trust then   Trump with intelligence secrets, citing alleged fears that Russia held blackmail information over Trump.  Those fears seemed to have been in part referencing the now partially debunked infamous dossier claiming that Russia collected compromising videos of Trump. The dossier, which contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed, was compiled by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. Meanwhile, the Obama administration faced its share of accusations that it leaked sensitive Israeli intelligence or military operations. In November 2013, Israeli officials were reportedly furious at the Obama White House for confirming the Israeli Air Force was behind a strike on a Syrian military base. Israeli policy is not to confirm strikes carried out beyond its borders. The Times of Israel reported at the time: Israelâ€™s Channel 10 TV on Friday night quoted Israeli officials branding the American leak as â€œscandalous. â€ For Israelâ€™s ally to be acting in this way was â€œunthinkable,â€ the officials were quoted as saying. A second TV report, on Israelâ€™s Channel 2, said the leak â€œcame directly from the White House,â€ and noted that â€œthis is not the first timeâ€ that the administration has compromised Israel by leaking information on such Israeli Air Force raids on Syrian targets. It said some previous leaks were believed to have come from the Pentagon, and that consideration had been given at one point to establishing a panel to investigate the sources. In 2012, Israel suspected the Obama administration had leaked information to prevent the Jewish state from striking Iranâ€™s nuclear facilities. ABC News reported at the time: The first report in Foreign Policy quotes anonymous American officials saying that Israel has been given access to airbases by Iranâ€™s northern neighbor Azerbaijan from which Israel could launch air strikes or at least drones and search and rescue aircraft. The second report from Bloomberg, based on a leaked congressional report, said that Iranâ€™s nuclear facilities are so dispersed that it is â€œunclear what the ultimate effect of a strike would be  â€¦    â€ A strike could delay Iran as little as six months, a former official told the researchers. â€œIt seems like a big campaign to prevent Israel from attacking,â€ analyst Yoel Guzansky at the Institute for National Security Studies told ABC News. â€œI think the [Obama] administration is really worried Jerusalem will attack and attack soon. Theyâ€™re trying hard to prevent it in so many ways. â€ Aaron Klein is Breitbartâ€™s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

21018,How to Stay Safe at the Airport - The New York Times,Shivani Vora,"False reports of gunfire at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 28 caused panic among travelers, led to the evacuation of the airport and resulted in more than 250 flight delays. A similar incident occurred two weeks earlier at Kennedy International Airport in New York. While there was no real active shooter in either case, the fear that fliers had during these episodes is very real. Crime statistics show that over all, violence in the United States is as low as it has ever been, yet terrorist attacks at airports in Brussels and Istanbul and mass shootings in the United States have caused passengers to fear loud noises and commotion. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about airport safety and what to do if you fear that an active shooter is at an airport. What are the chances of an active shooting or a terrorist attack happening at an airport?  Very small, said Larry Studdiford, a security consultant for airports and the founder of Studdiford Technical Solutions, a security firm in Alexandria, Va. An estimated 3. 5 billion people flew globally in 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade association for the worldâ€™s airlines, and comparatively, there were only a handful of incidences at airports. â€œThe chances of a passenger being involved in a shooting or attack at an airport are minimal,â€ he said. â€œAnd, while fear of being at an airport is natural following any airport incident around the world, such as what happened in Istanbul recently, you are more at risk of getting into a car accident on the way to the airport than running into trouble at the airport. â€ If thereâ€™s a crowd of people running around an airport and you donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happened, what should you do? Do not follow the crowds running around, said Mike Ackerman, an expert in travel security and the founder and chairman of the Fort   security consulting firm Ackerman Group. Instead, try to find a safe harbor in a quiet place, such as a restroom, and move away from the commotion. â€œAirports, unlike hotels, donâ€™t have evacuation points because they are supposed to be secure, so itâ€™s not like you can easily get out,â€ he said. Your best bet is to find a way to stay safe within the airport. If you are in an airport, and there is a potential shooter   what should you do? The minute you hear a loud noise or any commotion, move away from it  â€”   not toward it  â€”   Mr. Ackerman said. â€œThere is a tendency for people to be curious when they hear a loud noise and go toward the trouble, but you want to do just the opposite,â€ he said. How do you increase your chances of staying safe at an airport? When you get to the airport and have checked in, get through security as quickly as possible, said Mr. Ackerman, because if an attack is going to happen, it will likely be in the area before fliers reach security. â€œMost attacks in airports, including the attacks in Brussels and Istanbul earlier this year, happen before security checkpoints because the bulk of armed personnel are at, and after you get through, security, and a shooter likely doesnâ€™t want to deal with them,â€ he said. In addition, Mr. Studdiford advised staying away from areas where people tend to congregate, such as ticket counters,   kiosks and baggage claim. â€œIf an attack is going to happen at an airport, itâ€™s likely going to be where there are crowds, so youâ€™re better off staying away from these spots as much as possible,â€ he said. Check in for your flight before reaching the airport, and get through security faster by signing up for TSA   at baggage claim, he said, donâ€™t wait at an idle belt  â€”   approach it to pick up your bag only when the belt starts moving. Are some airports safer than others? Not really, especially in the United States, said T. J. Schulz, the president of the trade association Airport Consultants Council and an aviation security expert. â€œAirports are of different sizes and have different layouts, and that doesnâ€™t mean one is safer than another, but airports in the United States, in general, are safe,â€ he said. And, travelers should have some peace of mind knowing that all domestic airports have a team of security personnel in addition, some have federal security officers, including armed T. S. A. officers, as well local police  ."

W ill Trump pull a Brexit times ten? What would it take, beyond WikiLeaks, to bring the Clinton (cash) machine down? Will Hillary win and then declare WWIII against her Russia/Iran/Syria â€œaxis of evilâ€? Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025? Amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America, originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan. By the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 â€“ that seminal â€œbefore and afterâ€ event â€“ Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, itâ€™s a black market paroxysm. Global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work â€“ as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking. Way beyond the late 20th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as â€œliberal democracyâ€ â€“ actually a neoliberal diktat â€“ has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe lâ€™oeil effect. Whatâ€™s left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche). Baudrillard already knew that the concept of â€œalterâ€ â€“ killed by conviviality â€“ does not exist in the official market. So an â€œalterâ€ black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; thatâ€™s, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a â€œcontraband alterâ€, expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized. There could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and â€œvaluesâ€; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica â€“ artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought. The result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society â€“ with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia â€“ and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power. The end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market. Is there any information â€œtruthâ€? B audrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media/information system â€“ still ruled by America â€“ is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism. This abstraction of information works as in the economy â€“ disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value. Since all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information. And that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics â€“ where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation). Thus this quintessential Baudrillard insight; if we consider History as a movie â€“ and thatâ€™s what it is now â€“ then the â€œtruthâ€ of information is no more than post-production synch, dubbing and subtitles. Way beyond the late 20th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as â€œliberal democracyâ€ â€“ actually a neoliberal diktat â€“ has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe lâ€™oeil effect . Still, as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events, there is immense disappointment as well, because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them. Call it a pathetic, universal contagion; people donâ€™t know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm â€“ in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences. No acts, deeds, crimes (the 2008 financial crisis), political events (the WikiLeaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the â€œnonprofitâ€ Clinton cash machine, whatâ€™s private and whatâ€™s public, the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth, and the affairs of the state) seem to have real consequences. Immunity, impunity, corruption, speculation â€“ we veer towards a state of zero responsibility (think Goldman Sachs). So, automatically, we yearn for an event of maximum consequence, a â€œfatalâ€ event to repair that scandalous non-equivalence. Like a symbolic re-equilibrium of the scales of destiny. So we dream of an amazing event â€“ Trump winning the election? Hillary declaring WWIII? â€“ that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes. Shadowing the world J ust like Baudrillard, I got to see â€œdeepâ€ America in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across America. So sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning, â€œObjects in this mirror may be closer than they appear.â€ But what if they may also be further than they appear? The contemporary instant event/celebrity culture deluge of images upon us; does it get us closer to a so-called â€œrealâ€ world that is in fact very far away from us? Or does it in fact keep the world at a distance â€“ creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent? In parallel, we keep slouching towards a single future language â€“ the language of algorithms, as designed across the Wall Street/Silicon Valley axis â€“ that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe, just like the globalist/New World Order dream of One Thought and One Culture. Languages are multiple and singular â€“ by definition. If there were a single language, words would become univocal, regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning. There would be no interplay â€“ as in artificial languages thereâ€™s no interplay. Language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality â€“ the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species. Thatâ€™s where the American â€œdreamâ€ seems to be heading.

21020,Volkswagen Emissions Scandal Inquiry Widens to Top Levels - The New York Times,Jack Ewing,"FRANKFURT  â€”   The investigation into emissions fraud at Volkswagen reached the very top of the company on Sunday after the carmaker said that the chairman of the supervisory board, Hans Dieter PÃ¶tsch, is suspected by German prosecutors of violating securities laws. Mr. PÃ¶tsch, the former chief financial officer at Volkswagen, is accused of failing to notify shareholders quickly enough of the financial risks of the diesel emissions cheating scandal, which has already led to a $15 billion settlement in the United States and caused the stock price to plunge. The disclosure that Mr. PÃ¶tsch is the subject of an investigation is likely to intensify criticism that Volkswagen remains in the hands of many of the longtime insiders who were in charge while the company was producing millions of cars that were deliberately designed to cheat on   tests. More than a year after the company was accused of wrongdoing, the scandal is still widening and the damage to Volkswagenâ€™s finances and reputation continues to expand. The investigation of Mr. PÃ¶tsch could also provide ammunition to investor groups and mutual funds that are suing Volkswagen in the United States and Germany. The lawsuits claim that Volkswagen managers were aware of the impending scandal and failed to notify shareholders as required by law. The suits could cost the company additional billions of euros. A confidant of the Porsche and PiÃ«ch families, who own a majority of Volkswagenâ€™s voting shares, Mr. PÃ¶tsch was elevated to chairman of the supervisory board in October 2015. That was a few weeks after the Environmental Protection Agency accused the carmaker of manipulating engine software to conceal illegally high levels of nitrogen oxide emissions. Mr. PÃ¶tsch had been the chief financial officer of Volkswagen since 2003 and a member of the companyâ€™s management board. As chairman of the supervisory board, Mr. PÃ¶tsch oversees the management board. In a statement, Volkswagen said that its management board â€œduly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under German capital markets law. â€ Volkswagen is also under investigation in the United States, not only for programming cars to cheat but also for orchestrating an elaborate   starting in early 2014 after tests first cast doubt on what the company claimed were â€œclean dieselâ€ cars. In fact, the Volkswagen cars emitted as much as 40 times the permitted levels of nitrogen oxides, a family of gases that can cause health problems including asthma and cancer. Nitrogen oxides also contribute to global warming and acid rain, and are a leading cause of the smog that chokes cities like Los Angeles. Volkswagen engineers went so far as to concoct fake engineering data to try to explain a huge discrepancy between the readings in official laboratories and how much the cars polluted on the road, said Alberto Ayala, deputy executive officer of the California Air Resources Board, which did much of the detective work that led to Volkswagenâ€™s exposure. â€œThey lied through their teeth,â€ Mr. Ayala said in an interview in California last month. The   which lasted more than a year, ultimately raised the cost of the scandal to Volkswagen. It has not been able to take advantage of lower financial penalties normally available to corporate wrongdoers who are forthcoming with information and who swiftly take disciplinary action against the responsible employees. Volkswagen has portrayed the malfeasance as the work of midlevel engineers and managers acting without knowledge of top management. But that position has become difficult to defend as more information becomes available from court documents. Lawsuits against Volkswagen by car owners as well as state attorneys general portray a vast conspiracy involving hundreds of Volkswagen employees as well as suppliers like Robert Bosch, the German company that manufactured engine computers for affected vehicles in the United States. The identification of Mr. PÃ¶tsch as a target of the investigation could also intensify criticism of the Porsche and PiÃ«ch families, descendants of Volkswagenâ€™s founder, Ferdinand Porsche, who own a majority of Volkswagenâ€™s voting shares. Mr. PÃ¶tsch is closely associated with the family and is also chief executive of Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the holding company for the familyâ€™s shares in Volkswagen. Other investors have criticized the families for poor oversight of Volkswagen and helping to create the corporate culture that led to the wrongdoing. Just one person has been formally charged in the case. In September, James Liang, a Volkswagen engineer, pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to defraud regulators and car owners. Mr. Liang agreed to cooperate with investigators and has not yet been sentenced. Mr. Liang was in the United States, but most of the other potential suspects are in Germany. Attempts to work out plea agreements with the others have so far foundered on differences between German and American laws. In Germany, prosecutors have much less scope to offer defendants reduced sentences in return for guilty pleas. Many of the potential suspects are being careful not to leave Germany, lest they be arrested on American warrants, according to lawyers as well as engineers who have been questioned by investigators. Germany does not usually extradite its citizens, but there is no protection for Germans traveling in other European countries. Prosecutors and Volkswagen have previously disclosed that Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive of Volkswagen, and Herbert Diess, a member of the management board responsible for the Volkswagen brand, are also under investigation for violating the companyâ€™s duty to disclose information that could affect the companyâ€™s share price. Mr. Winterkorn resigned shortly after the E. P. A. accused Volkswagen of wrongdoing in September 2015, but Mr. Diess remains a member of the management board. Volkswagen shares have lost a quarter of their value since the scandal came to light. The state of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 percent of Volkswagen shares and occupies two seats on the supervisory board, said on Sunday that Mr. PÃ¶tsch was innocent until proven guilty and that it would be wrong to arrive at â€œrash conclusions. â€ In a statement, the state said that members of the supervisory board were briefed on Friday on the latest findings by internal investigators. The report provided â€œno occasion for further measures,â€ the state said."

21022,Watch: Gorsuch Responds to Charge From Student Accusing Him of Discrimination Against Pregnant Female Lawyers - Breitbart,Breitbart TV,"#Gorsuch asked about letter by student accusing him of encouraging discrimination against pregnant female lawyers https:  .  pic. twitter.  Tuesday at his confirmation before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Neil Gorsuch responded to an accusation made by former Obama administration staffer Jennifer Sisk that he once told students women manipulate maternity leave.  Sisk, a graduate of the University of Colorado Law School, alleged Gorsuch made the comments in a legal ethics class. However, when confronted by Sen. Dick Durbin ( ) Gorsuch promptly denied the allegation. Transcript as follows: DURBIN: Let me ask you this specific one. It was 1993 and you were at Oxford, when you believe you first met this professor. Professor Finnis was tapped by the   Solicitor General Timothy Tymkovich, to help defend a 1992 state constitutional amendment that broadly restricted the state from protecting gay, Lesbian and bisexual people from discrimination. During the course of the deposition which he gave in support of that effort, Finnis argued that antipathy toward LGBT people, specifically toward gay sex, was rooted not just in religious tradition, but Western law and society at large. He referred to homosexuality as bestiality in the course of this as well. Were you aware of that? GORSUCH: Senator, I  â€”   I know he testified in the Romer case. I canâ€™t say sitting here I recall the specifics of his testimony or that he gave a deposition. DURBIN: I guess the reason Iâ€™m raising this is this is a man who apparently had an impact on your life, certainly your academic life. And Iâ€™m trying to figure out where we can parse his views from your views what impact he had on you as a student what impact he has on you today with his views. GORSUCH: Well, then I guess, Senator, I think the best evidence is what Iâ€™ve written. Iâ€™ve written over  â€”   gosh, written or joined over 6 million words as a federal appellate judge. Iâ€™ve written a couple of books. Iâ€™ve been a lawyer and a judge for 25 or 30 years. Thatâ€™s my record. And I guess Iâ€™d ask you respectfully to look at my credentials and my record. And some of the examples Iâ€™ve given you from my record about the capital habeas work, about access to justice. Iâ€™ve spoken about   publicly. Those are  â€”   those are things Iâ€™ve done, Senator. DURBIN: And what about LGBT (inaudible) individuals? GORSUCH: Well, Senator, there are  â€”   what about them? DURBIN: Well, the point I made is  â€¦     GORSUCH: Theyâ€™re people. And, you know  â€¦     DURBIN: Of course. But what you said earlier was that you have a record of speaking out, standing up for those minorities who you believe are not being treated fairly. Can you point to statements or cases youâ€™ve ruled on relative to that class? GORSUCH: Senator, I try to treat each case, and each person, as a person, not a this kind of person, not a that kind of person  â€”   a person. Equal justice under law is a radical promise in the history of mankind. DURBIN: Does that refer to sexual orientation as well? GORSUCH: Senator, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that   marriage is protected by the Constitution. DURBIN: Judge, would you agree that if an employer were to ask female job applicants about their family plans, but not male applicants, that would be evidence of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act? GORSUCH: Senator, Iâ€™d agree with you itâ€™s highly inappropriate. DURBIN: You donâ€™t believe itâ€™s prohibited? GORSUCH: Senator, it sounds like a potential hypothetical case. It might be a case or controversy I might have to decide, and I wouldnâ€™t want to   it sitting here at the confirmation table. I can tell you it would be inappropriate. DURBIN: Inappropriate. Do you believe that there are ever situations where the costs to an employer of maternity leave can justify an employer asking only female applicants and not male applicants about family plans? GORSUCH: Senator, those are not my words and I would never have said them. DURBIN: I didnâ€™t say that. I asked you if you agree with the statement. GORSUCH: And Iâ€™m telling you I donâ€™t. DURBIN: Thank you. In Wang vs. Kansas State, the case involved a   professor. You wrote an opinion that noted that EEOC guidance commands deference, quote, â€œonly to the extent its reasoning actually proves persuasive. EEOCâ€™s enforcement guidance on pregnancy discrimination provides as follows. Because Title Seven prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, employers should not make inquiries into whether an applicant or employee intends to become pregnant. The EEOC will generally regard such an inquiry as evidence of pregnancy discrimination where the employer subsequently makes an unfavorable job decision affecting a pregnant worker. Do you find this instruction to be persuasive? GORSUCH: Senator, I  â€”   thereâ€™s a lot of words there. And if youâ€™re asking me to parse them out and give you a legal opinion, then I  â€”   I fear that you may be  â€”   I  â€”   Iâ€™d respectfully say Iâ€™d have to study it in the course of a judicial case. DURBIN: Well, let me bring it right down to the operative words. Whether employee should or should not make inquiries into whether an applicant or employee intends to become pregnant. GORSUCH: Senator, I need to  â€”   it sounds like youâ€™re asking me about a case for a controversy. And I  â€”   with all respect, when we come to cases in controversies, a good judge will listen. Socrates said the first virtue of a good judge is to listen courteously and decide impartially. DURBIN: I think you know why Iâ€™m asking these questions. GORSUCH: No, this one I  â€”   I donâ€™t. DURBIN: The reason Iâ€™m asking is because about your views on pregnancy women in the work place is because two of your former students from legal ethics and professionalism class last spring wrote to this committee to say how troubled they were by your comments in an April 19th class. It was a   discussion regarding the hardship to employers of having female employees who may use maternity benefits. One of these students signed her name publicly to her letter, which is a pretty brave thing to do. That student didnâ€™t just make this issue up after you were nominated. Last night, the University of Colorado Law School confirmed that she had voiced her concerns with administrators shortly after your April 19th class and also confirmed that the administrators told her they would raise this matter with you, though they never actually did so. When we receive information like this which raises questions about your views and conduct on important issues, I want to get to the bottom of it. I mentioned that to you yesterday in my opening statement that I would be bringing this up. So, I just want to ask you to confirm, did you ask your students in class that day to raise their hands if they knew of a woman who had taken maternity benefits from a company and then left the company after having a baby? GORSUCH: No, Senator. And Iâ€™d be delighted to actually clear this up. DURBIN: Please. GORSUCH: Because the first I heard of this was the night before my confirmation hearing. Iâ€™ve been teaching legal ethics at the University of Colorado for seven or eight years. Itâ€™s been a great honor and a pleasure. I teach from a standard text book that every professor  â€”   well, I donâ€™t know if every professor  â€”   a number of professors at CU and elsewhere use. Itâ€™s an excellent textbook  â€”  Professors Lerman and Shrag. In one of the chapters in the book confronts lawyers with some harsh realities that theyâ€™re about to face when they enter the practice of law. As you know and I know, we have an unhappy and unhealthy profession in a lot of ways. Lawyers commit suicide at rates far higher than the population. Alcoholism, divorce, depression are also at extremely high rates. Young lawyers also face the problem of having enormous debts when they leave law school. As a  â€”   and thatâ€™s a huge inhibition for them to be able to do public service like you and I are so privileged to be able to do. We talk about those things. There is one problem in the book  â€”   and Iâ€™d be happy to share with you the book and the teacherâ€™s manual so that you can see for yourself, Senator  â€”   which asks a question. And itâ€™s directed to young women because sadly, this is a reality they sometimes face. The problem is this. Suppose an older partner woman at the firm that youâ€™re interviewing at asks you if you intend to become pregnant soon. What are your choices as a young person? You can say yes, tell the truth. Hypothetical is that itâ€™s true and not get the job and not be able to pay your debts. You can lie, maybe get the job. You can say no. Thatâ€™s a  â€”   thatâ€™s a choice, too. Itâ€™s a hard choice. Or you can push back in some way shape or form. And we talk about the pros and the cons in this acratic (ph) dialogue that they can think through for themselves how they might answer that very difficult question. And Senator, I do ask for a show of hands, not about the question you asked, but about the following question. And I ask it of everybody. How many of you have had questions like this asked of you in the employment environment, an inappropriate question about your family planning? And I am shocked every year, Senator, how many young women raise their hand. Itâ€™s disturbing to me. I knew this stuff happened when my mom was a young practicing lawyer, graduating law school in the 1960sâ€™. At age 20, she had to wait for a year to take the bar. I knew it happened with Justice Oâ€™Connor, couldnâ€™t get a job as a lawyer when she graduated Stanford Law School and had to work as a secretary. I am shocked it still happens every year that I get women, not men, raising their hand to that question. Thank you for the opportunity to clarify that Senator.

21024,"Comment on Boy says farewell to best friend, 91-year-old World War II vet from next door by Joe",Joe,"Grab a hankyâ€¦ Photo courtesy of Anika Rychner 
From Today.com : Emmett Rychner was the first to move away. Two years ago, the young preschooler moved to a neighboring town, leaving behind his best friend, Erling Kindem, a World War II veteran who lived next door. 
Last week, the time arrived for a final goodbye. 
Erling, 91, died last Saturday, just three days after 6-year-old Emmett paid a visit to the nursing home where he was receiving hospice care. 
â€œAfter we told Emmett that Erling had passed away, he was very quiet for a while,â€ his mother Anika Rychner told TODAY. â€œThe first thing he said was, â€˜So weâ€™ll just have to wait a really long time. I know weâ€™ll see him again in heaven.â€™â€ 
For more than a decade, the two families lived next to each other in a Minneapolis suburb, but didnâ€™t have much of a relationship beyond saying hello. That changed after Emmett came along. 
â€œHe was about 2 when this all started. He would start venturing over to Erlingâ€™s backyard when he was out in his garden with his tomatoes,â€ Rychner recalled. 
One day, when Emmett saw Erling pouring dirt around his new sidewalk, he grabbed his toy shovel and wheelbarrow and walked over. 
Erling was tickled by his new companion and they instantly bonded. 
From then, Emmett went outside anytime he spotted his buddy. â€œHe would also go knock on Erlingâ€™s door and ask if Erling could play,â€ his mother recalled with a laugh. 
The two had lawn mower races (Emmett rode his electric toy mower). They played croquet and rode bicycles. And they cared for Erlingâ€™s garden, which grew one of the boyâ€™s favorite foods, tomatoes. 
â€œHe especially liked the cherry ones that he could pick right there and eat in the garden. So heâ€™d help Dad weed the garden,â€ Erlingâ€™s son, Charlie Kindem, told TODAY. 
Two years ago, Emmettâ€™s growing family moved away to the countryside. A month later, Erling and his wife moved to a senior apartment. But the two friends continued to visit each other regularly. Photo courtesy Anika Rychner 
â€œErling was still driving when we moved away, so we would sometimes come home and find tomatoes from his garden on our front porch, or a note for Emmett with some other treasure he brought him,â€ Rychner said. 
â€œIf we hadnâ€™t visited in a while, Erling would call, and we would go visit,â€ she said. â€œOr sometimes the kids weâ€™d say, â€˜We should go see Erling,â€™ and we would stop on our way home from school.â€ 
Emmett often drew pictures of B-24 bomber planes for his friend, who served as a radio operator and gunner during World War II. 
â€œA lot of kids are not comfortable around elderly people because they look different. Emmett always was,â€ Rychner said. â€œHe was never was shy about hugging Erling and holding his hand.â€ 
When Erlingâ€™s wife, Joyce, with whom he had five children, died last fall, Emmett and his family attended her funeral. 
â€œIt was a natural thing,â€ Kindem said of his fatherâ€™s relationship with Emmett. â€œHe didnâ€™t talk down to him at all. He talked to him like he was a regular person and not a little kid.â€ 
But Erling was always like that, his son said. 
â€œDad was always friendly with kids. Growing up, he would play with us, whether it was baseball or football,â€ he said. He recalled how Erling flooded the vacant lot next door to their home every winter to turn it into an ice rink. 
This past spring, Erling moved into an assisted living home. But his heart condition began to worsen and last month, he moved into a nursing home, where he received hospice care. 
Emmett saw his friend the day after he moved in, and again last week. That was when Emmett read his friend the Lordâ€™s prayer, and Erling encouraged his buddy to listen to his parents. Their final goodbyeâ€¦ 
â€œIt felt like a goodbye,â€ Rychner said. Erling passed away three days later. 
Emmett has been more quiet than usual, but appears to have absorbed the news, in part because his parents had been preparing him. Rychner said she considers it â€œa wonderful giftâ€ that Emmett had the chance to experience the decline of a friendâ€™s health in such a positive, natural way. 
She felt proud her son didnâ€™t shy away from Erling, even in his illness. 
â€œWe all have to experience death at some point in our life of a loved one. Thatâ€™s an important part of growing up. You canâ€™t avoid it,â€ she said. 
Both Rychner and Kindem said they have been moved by the outpouring of support since NBC-affiliate KARE first reported their story two years ago. The station continued to chronicle the friendship and reported the news of Erlingâ€™s death. 
â€œHe has strong faith that he will see him again,â€ Rychner said.

21028,The Eternal Struggle of the Empty Nester - The New York Times,Henry Alford,"The etiquette of the empty nest can bedevil even the most sophisticated parent. Take, for instance, the actress Alfre Woodard. Ms. Woodard said that when her younger child (her son, Duncan) went to college in 2012, her depression caught her in a bind. â€œSuddenly the thing that made my life vibrant and not like a showbizzy personâ€™s life was gone,â€ said Ms. Woodard, who can be seen in Netflixâ€™s coming series â€œMarvelâ€™s Luke Cage. â€ â€œI was leaking. I not only lost Duncanâ€™s presence, but I lost having a lot of big, smelly kids  â€”   his friends  â€”   in the house all the time. They used to play lacrosse in my driveway. I used to cook for them. â€ Lest she make her son uncomfortable, Ms. Woodard tried to obscure her sadness. â€œI would hide in the bathroom and weep into a wet face towel,â€ she said. But then she worried that maybe she had overcorrected course and seemed unfeeling. â€œSo I told him, â€˜Letâ€™s cry together for a couple of minutes so that you know Iâ€™m gonna miss you.â€™ He said sure. So we stood there for a couple of minutes and then finally he said, â€˜O. K. Mom. Iâ€™ll be upstairs. â€™â€ Parents have been crying into face towels for centuries. But   syndrome has gained especial piquancy in a world in which parents and their   offspring are in the habit of texting one another a few times a day, and in which accounts of shootings on campuses are repeated on social media with a frequency bordering on the abject. The pot may be further sweetened by a recent Pew Research Center studyâ€™s determination that, for the first time on record, the most common arrangement for people aged 18 to 34 is living with parents. So now those parents whose children do move out are alone in their aloneness. For many empty nesters, landing on the proper spot of the Umbilical   Arctic Gale continuum can be tricky. â€œYou have got to leave your kids alone,â€ Ms. Woodard said. â€œThe only time you text is if you have something really slamminâ€™ to say. Something you know theyâ€™re really into. Like, Duncan is a big golfer, so Iâ€™ll text, â€˜Oh, no, Rory didnâ€™t!â€™ Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll say. What you donâ€™t want to write is â€˜Your room is so warm!â€™ Or â€˜Have you eaten?â€™ Or â€˜Do you have any friends?â€™ â€˜Are you drunk? â€™â€ Some parents and students are tempted to use Facebook and Instagram as the worldâ€™s cheapest baby cam, though â€œsome students say that no way do they want their parents on social media,â€ said Karen Coburn, the senior consultant in residence at the office of the vice chancellor for students at Washington University in St. Louis. â€œOthers say they like it because it means they donâ€™t have to communicate with their folks as much because the parents get an idea of what the kids are up to,â€ Ms. Coburn said. â€œBut one of the worst things a parent can do is to â€˜friendâ€™ one of their kidâ€™s friends. One of my students told me, â€˜Another student came up to me and said, â€˜This old woman friended me on Facebook, I think it might be your mom or grandmother.â€™ The â€˜old womanâ€™ was probably 45. â€ Indeed, fences are usually built for a reason. Robert Lindquist, a freshman at the University of Connecticut who is majoring in digital media and design, has imposed a    rule on visits from his family. â€œIt started out as a joke,â€ Mr. Lindquist said. â€œIâ€™m going to school only an hour and a half away from my parents. Itâ€™s not quite as inconvenient as Iâ€™d intended. â€ Mr. Lindquist said: â€œThe rule applies to any family member. We have a term, â€˜the Lindquist Confusion Factor,â€™ because I have nine aunts and uncles. Theyâ€™re excellent people, but that many of them can be a little much if youâ€™re not prepared. â€ Asked how his parents reacted to the demand, Mr. Lindquist said, â€œI donâ€™t recall them being overjoyed. â€ Some people view the concept of   syndrome itself as suspect. Shayla Rivera, a comedian, says in her   act that she had to look up the term on the internet: â€œWhite women get sad when the children leave the house. What?â€ Asked about the routine, Ms. Rivera, who has a    son and a    daughter, emailed from Kosovo, where she was performing for American troops, â€œAs I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, some of the North American vicissitudes were not part of my paradigm. They say that women actually go into their kidsâ€™ room and smell their clothing! Are you kidding me? I spent 18 years shutting my sonâ€™s door so the smell of dirty socks and other mysterious aromas wouldnâ€™t come into the house. When he left I had to go in there with sage, holy water and a priest. â€ All joking aside, Ms. Woodard said that   parents may feel a childâ€™s absence even more acutely. â€œTheir house or apartment is smaller, so the kidâ€™s presence is missed more,â€ she said. â€œAlso,   parents probably raised that kid on their own. â€ Regardless of the factors when a household is decanted of its young people, itâ€™s clear that kids who leave their home need a lot of room to grow in, and that parents need to hone their listening skills. Once, when Ms. Coburn asked a Washington University student to give advice to a group of the schoolâ€™s parents, the young woman offered: â€œSometimes we want your advice and sometimes we donâ€™t. The challenge is, we wonâ€™t tell you which time is which. â€ Nina Keneally, a mother of two who lives in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, runs a service called Need a Mom, in which she can be hired as a combination mentor and life coach. â€œMost of them donâ€™t complain about their parents being in touch too much,â€ Ms. Keneally said of her clients in their 20s. â€œBut a lot of them talk to me about stuff that they wouldnâ€™t talk to their parents about: relationship problems, or things theyâ€™re contemplating doing or not doing. Parents would jump in too quickly, or would be embarrassed about what the kid is proposing. â€ Indeed, the greatest lesson for many empty nesters may be learning to be their childâ€™s coach or inspiration rather than a childâ€™s concierge or critic. In 2014, when students at Keene State College in New Hampshire injected a local event called the Pumpkin Festival with   and   the president of the college chastised her students for failing to â€œpumpkin responsibly. â€ It seems only natural that a parent, on hauling the last box of his childâ€™s shinguards and Harry Potter effluvia into the unsupervised blankness of a dorm room, may fear the advent of pumpkin irresponsibility. In the end, empathy and patience are an empty nesterâ€™s Xanax. I asked Ms. Woodard what she would say to her parents today about keeping in touch if she were a young person going off to college. Ms. Woodard didnâ€™t miss a beat: â€œI would say, â€˜Iâ€™ll hit you up. â€™â€"

A mistrial was declared in the case of a white former police officer in South Carolina who shot an unarmed black man in the back last year. The jury, a panel of 11 white people and a black man, said it would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict. On Friday, the jury had signaled that it was within a single vote of convicting Michael Slager, who was captured on video firing the fatal shots at Walter Scott. _____ 3.   movements across Europe are among the winners after a constitutional referendum in Italy failed and the countryâ€™s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, above, resigned. The vote deepened concerns that Italian banks could spiral into disaster and worries about the endurance of the euro. In Britain, the Supreme Court began what is expected to be four days of hearings on the governmentâ€™s efforts to retain a free hand in organizing the exit from the European Union. _____ 4. The North Carolina man who was arrested for firing a rifle in a popular Washington pizzeria confirmed he was motivated by a fake news story about a suspected child trafficking ring allegedly running out of the restaurant and led by Hillary Clinton. Edgar Welch, above, told police he went to the restaurant to â€œ â€ the pedophilia hoax. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trumpâ€™s choice for national security adviser, is under scrutiny for sharing similar conspiracy theories about Mrs. Clinton. _____ 5. Ben Carson, who endorsed Mr. Trump after ending his own presidential bid, was chosen as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He has no experience in government or expertise in housing policy, but he opposes government programs that he says encourage â€œdependency. â€ Mr. Trump is expected to fill a series of other domestic positions this week. So far, heâ€™s selected a mix of wealthy outsiders, Republican insiders and former military officers. _____ 6. Tensions between China and Mr. Trump are escalating, even before the   takes office. A   editorial in the overseas edition of Peopleâ€™s Daily, the official organ of the Communist Party of China, denounced Mr. Trump for speaking with Taiwanâ€™s president, and Mr. Trump posted messages on Twitter that stepped up pressure on Beijing.

Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, above, has conceded in his bid for   giving the national Democratic Party a rare cause for celebration. Mr. McCrory, a Republican, drew nationwide attention during his one term for signing a law limiting bathroom access for transgender people. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, declared victory on election night, but the win was contested. _____ 9. â€œWe must never repeat the horror of war. â€ Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s announcement that he will visit Pearl Harbor, the U.

21030,Dangerous Fruit: Mystery of Deadly Outbreaks in India Is Solved - The New York Times,Ellen Barry,"NEW DELHI  â€”   Three years ago, Dr. Rajesh Yadav, an investigator with the India Epidemic Intelligence Service, moved to the city of Muzaffarpur, the site of one of the countryâ€™s most mysterious outbreaks. And he waited. Every year in   as temperatures reached scorching heights, parents took children who had been healthy the night before to the hospital. The children awakened with a   cry in the early morning, many parents said. Then the youths began having seizures and slipping into comas. In about 40 percent of cases, they died. Every year in July, with the arrival of monsoon rains, the outbreak ended as suddenly as it began. Beginning in 1995, investigations variously ascribed the phenomenon to heat stroke to infections carried by rats, bats or sand flies or to pesticides used in the regionâ€™s ubiquitous lychee orchards. But there were few signposts for investigators. Instead of occurring in clusters, the illness typically struck only one child in a village, often leaving even siblings unaffected. A joint investigation by Indiaâ€™s National Center for Disease Control and the India office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, published  in the British medical journal The Lancet Global Health on Tuesday, has identified a surprising culprit: the lychee fruit itself, when eaten on an empty stomach by malnourished children. In 2015, as a result of the investigation, health officials began urging parents in the area to be sure to feed young children an evening meal and to limit their consumption of lychees (sometimes spelled litchi). In two seasons, the number of reported cases per year dropped to less than 50 from hundreds. â€œIt was an unexplained illness for so many years,â€ said Padmini Srikantiah, a senior epidemiologist with the C. D. C. and the senior author of the paper. â€œThis is kind of emblematic of why we collaborate, to build this kind of systematic approach. â€ The Lancet article walks through a   medical detective story, as epidemiologists like Dr. Yadav closely examined the lives of hundreds of afflicted children, trying to understand everything they had eaten, drunk and breathed. â€œIt was a very intense situation, because we witnessed children dying in front of our eyes every day, as soon as they arrived at the hospital,â€ said Dr. Yadav, who now works with the C. D. C. in Atlanta. Especially difficult were the detailed interviews of parents, many of whom had carried a convulsing or comatose child for hours to get to the hospital. â€œThey were in a kind of panic,â€ he said. â€œTheir children were dying, and it was an unknown thing. â€ The first clue: There was no evidence the children had infections.  For 20 years, clinicians were unable to determine if the disease, which led to acute brain swelling known as encephalopathy, was caused by an infection  â€”   the immediate assumption in many outbreaks here. Investigators pored over records from the previous yearâ€™s outbreak and were struck by the fact that many of the sick children did not have a fever. Analysis of spinal fluid samples overwhelmingly showed that the affected children did not have elevated counts of white blood cells, a sign the body is fighting infection. The second clue: Most of the victims had very low blood sugar levels.  Having collected biological samples from more than 300 children, the researchers were able to scan a large number of markers  â€”   including some they hadnâ€™t suspected. Glucose had never been a particular concern for investigators. But some of the affected children had strikingly low levels, and those with low blood glucose were twice as likely to die, Dr. Srikantiah said. â€œIt seemed to be a little signal,â€ she continued. â€œOne of the things we heard multiple times from the childrenâ€™s mothers was that they didnâ€™t really eat dinner properly. â€ The third clue: Outbreaks had been associated with the ackee fruit.  It was in the fall of 2013, during a conference call with colleagues in Atlanta, that someone mentioned â€œJamaican vomiting sickness,â€ an outbreak in the West Indies that for many decades caused brain swelling, convulsions and altered mental states in children. The outbreak turned out to be tied to hypoglycin, a toxin found in the ackee fruit that inhibits the bodyâ€™s ability to synthesize glucose, leading to acute hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels. â€œIt had been going on for a decade, if not a century, before people really figured out what it was,â€ Dr. Srikantiah said. â€œNow, the grandmothers and the mothers teach their kids, â€˜Donâ€™t eat the unripe ackee fruit.â€™ â€ By late 2014, laboratory tests confirmed that lychees also contain high levels of hypoglycin, as well as a similar toxin known as methylenecyclopropyl glycine, or MCPG. This was an answer hiding in plain sight. The Muzaffarpur area, in Indiaâ€™s east, produces about 70 percent of Indiaâ€™s lychee harvest, and around the affected villages, â€œyou really couldnâ€™t go 100 meters without bumping into a lychee orchard,â€ Dr. Srikantiah said, referring to a distance of 330 feet. Though orchards were typically guarded by caretakers, children often ate lychees that were unripe or that had fallen to the ground. But because everyone in the region eats them, it was difficult for many to believe that, in isolated cases, it could set off a catastrophic illness. The fourth clue: Affected children had huge metabolic imbalances. By early 2015, C. D. C. laboratories had developed a test to measure hypoglycin in urine. They found extraordinary abnormalities in the affected children. â€œThe folks in the genetic labs said â€˜We havenâ€™t seen anything like this,â€™ â€ Dr. Srikantiah said. â€œThis was clearly abnormal. â€ With that established, the investigators asked participants if they would be comfortable issuing recommendations based on their findings: that young children in the affected areas be encouraged to always eat an evening meal, and that consumption of lychees should be limited. Everyone agreed. And it was done."
21031,"Investors Move Next Door, Unsettling a Black Beachside Enclave - The New York Times",John Leland,"William Pickens III has spent most of his 80 summers in Sag Harbor Hills, a beach community of modest bungalows on the edge of the Hamptons. His   principal built the house across the street his family doctor lived two doors down. Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were his house guests. Those were the people who came to Sag Harbor Hills. About a year and a half ago he noticed a change. There were new buyers, and they were different. They did not mix much, and they identified themselves by names like 81 Harvest Holdings L. L. C. or 45 Hillside Holdings L. L. C. â€œI donâ€™t know Mr. and Mrs. L. L. C. ,â€ Mr. Pickens said. â€œBut I know the family on either side of them, because I grew up with them. But who the hell is L. L. C. ?â€ â€œItâ€™s worrisome,â€ he added. â€œMay not be illegal, but itâ€™s worrisome. â€ Sag Harbor Hills and its neighboring subdivisions in the Long Island village of Sag Harbor, Ninevah and Azurest, are uncommon among American beach communities. After World War II, when Sag Harbor was home to a robust   working class, developers offered parcels in an undeveloped swath of town for $1, 000 or less. Black families bought in, creating three adjoining communities linked by dirt roads. Two nearby subdivisions, Eastville and Chatfieldâ€™s Hill, also attracted black home buyers. As in other black enclaves of segregated communities, laborers lived next to professionals and high rollers. For many it was a world of their own, a decompression zone  â€”   home in a way that even their city residences might not be, because it had been built by people like them. The racial makeup kept home prices down. White buyers tended to choose other parts of Sag Harbor. That is changing. As house prices in the Hamptons soar, Sag Harbor Hills and its neighbors are now luring investors looking for bargains. A lawyer named Bruce F. Bronster, backed by investors, has bought at least nine properties in the three communities, each registered to a different L. L. C. Others have followed. In November, residents received a mass email saying a buyer was willing to pay up to $600, 000 in cash for houses  â€”   was anyone interested? â€œIt feels like a hostile takeover,â€ Beverly Granger, a retired dentist, said, adding that strangers have come onto her property to post offers to buy. â€œPeople are very aggressively buying up properties and wanting to put bigger homes that are out of character for the community. It just feels different. â€ On a recent afternoon, the shaded ranch houses and small lots gave Sag Harbor Hills the feel of a quiet suburb, shaggy in a few spots, embellished with home additions in others, all leading to a ribbon of bayside beach. Neighbors waved as they passed one another on the street. Because banks in the 1950s and 1960s would not lend money in   areas, the homes that went up were small. So family life took shape outdoors, among neighbors, said Ms. Granger, who has spent summers in Sag Harbor Hills since 1951. â€œThere was no television,â€ Ms. Granger said, describing life in the hamlet. â€œYou got a little bit of radio. And so you really went in the homes to sleep and eat, and the rest of the time you were outside doing things. â€ Neighbors watched one anotherâ€™s children, she said. Houses tended to stay within families or among friends turnover was rare. With the arrival of celebrities like Harry Belafonte, Lena Horne, the restaurateur B. Smith and Allan Houston of the New York Knicks, the communities rivaled Oak Bluffs on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard as a vacation mecca for successful  . Colson Whitehead, writing about the summers of the black elite in his novel â€œSag Harbor,â€ described an oasis apart from his white prep school. â€œWe fit in there,â€ he wrote. At a village trusteesâ€™ meeting this month, residents faced off. Mr. Bronster was seeking approval to build a house of 5, 300 square feet on several combined lots, the biggest in an area where the median house size is 1, 378 square feet. Neighbors, including a group called Save Sag Harbor, which formed to keep   stores out of downtown, came ready to oppose him. Mr. Bronster brought backup to the   gathering. â€œHe brought his architect, he brought a   attorney and some other attorney, and he had aerial photographs and professionally done graphs,â€ said Victoria Sharp, a former director of the AIDS center at St. Lukeâ€™  Hospital in Manhattan. â€œIf Bronster was putting up a house of 4, 000 square feet, people would be fine with that,â€ Ms. Sharp said. â€œBut putting up a house of 53 hundred square feet represents a tipping point. The next one is 55, and the next one is 59. And heâ€™s got big money behind him and is going to make this neighborhood what it never has been. â€ Like others interviewed for this article, Ms. Sharp, who is white, said the tensions were not racial. She said that since moving to Sag Harbor Hills from another neighborhood in the village last February, she has been welcomed into her neighborsâ€™ homes. â€œItâ€™s exactly why I moved here,â€ she said. In 14 years in her previous house, she was never invited to a neighborâ€™s party. â€œThereâ€™s a real sense of community here. And thatâ€™s about, unfortunately, to be interrupted. â€ Mr. Bronster said he had no intention of changing the communityâ€™s atmosphere. He, too, was drawn by the neighborly feel, he said. â€œIâ€™m especially appreciative of the history of the neighborhood, how it was started, what it means to the residents who live there and how that has enabled the community to develop a very warm and gregarious and welcoming sense,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s why I want to be there. â€ He added that he was developing dilapidated houses to rent to â€œ  families that want to be part of the community. â€ An even bigger house, of 5, 900 square feet, has been proposed for four combined lots that belong to Robert Kapito, the president of the investment firm BlackRock, who is also one of Mr. Bronsterâ€™s investors. Mr. Kapito earned more than $20 million last year, according to company filings. Final approval for the two houses is pending. Renee Simons, who lives next to the site of Mr. Kapitoâ€™s proposed house, said that she felt dismissed by the newcomers, and at odds with some neighbors, who hope the new houses will raise the value of their homes. â€œIt feels like us versus them, which is not healthy,â€ Ms. Simons said. â€œItâ€™s not what I come here for. Thereâ€™s such an increase in contention now. â€ â€œWeâ€™re on defense,â€ she said. â€œSo then you get called a  . â€ Dianne McMillan Brannen, a real estate agent who has lived in Ninevah for 25 years, said she worried about a domino effect: investors combining lots to build bigger houses, which drives up sales prices, which tempts more families to sell, until eventually a historically rare   haven looks like just another upscale beach resort. In the last year, she said, 13 houses have been sold to builders or investors, compared with the usual four or five. â€œAn identity is the most important thing that could be lost,â€ Ms. Brannen said. â€œThis area is not always going to be  . You could have 250 homes, and it would be an entirely different set of people here. And those sets of people are not going to regard it as we have regarded it. And theyâ€™re not going to have a story to tell about whatâ€™s happened previously. And unless we tell that story, itâ€™ll go away. â€ Mr. Pickens, whose grandfather was an early field secretary of the N. A. A. C. P. said he welcomed newcomers, whatever their race, but not investors or people with four or five houses and no commitment to the community. â€œThis is sort of reverse integration,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s fine, thatâ€™s the American way. But there are 5, 000 miles of coastline in America, and five are commanded and owned by blacks. So we treasure what we own. That begins to disappear. Think about that. So thatâ€™s what weâ€™re dealing with. And once you leave here, you canâ€™t afford to come back. â€ Of the newcomers, he asked: â€œDo they really want to be here or do they want to see us out of here? Iâ€™m for integration, Iâ€™m not for elimination. â€"
21032,The Abnormal Normal of Nuclear Terror,Consortiumnews.com,"The Abnormal Normal of Nuclear Terror October 28, 2016 
Almost goofily, behind Official Washingtonâ€™s latest warmongering â€œgroup think,â€ the U.S. has plunged into a New Cold War against Russia with no debate about the enormous costs and the extraordinary risks of nuclear annihilation, Gray Brechin observes. 
By Gray Brechin 
When Lewis Mumford heard that a primitive atomic bomb had obliterated Hiroshima, the eminent urban and technology historian experienced â€œalmost physical nausea.â€ He instantly understood that humanity now had the means to exterminate itself. 
On March 2, 1946, seven months later, he published an essay titled â€œGentlemen: You Are Mad!â€ Not only did madmen, Mumford insist, â€œgovern our affairs in the name of order and security,â€ but he called his fellow Americans equally mad for viewing â€œthe madness of our leaders as if it expressed a traditional wisdom and common senseâ€ even as those leaders readied the means for â€œthe casual suicide of the human race.â€ Illustration by Chesley Bonestell of nuclear bombs detonating over New York City, entitled â€œHiroshima U.S.A.â€ Colliers, Aug. 5, 1950. 
In the 70 years since the Saturday Review of Literature published Mumfordâ€™s warning, that madness has grown to be normative so that those who question the cost, safety and promised security of the nuclear stockpile are regarded as the Trojans did Cassandra â€” if they are noticed at all. 
â€œThe bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it mus t be followed, â€ insisted Hillary Clinton in the third presidential debate as a means of affirming her own â€” rather than her opponentâ€™s â€” qualifications to give that order. â€œThereâ€™s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.â€ 
Four minutes to launch is a minute more than the three to midnight at which the Doomsday Clock now stands. Clinton no doubt calculated that voters would be more comfortable with her own steady finger on the nuclear trigger. I can think of no better proof of Mumfordâ€™s contention than the fact that those voters would give any individual the power to abruptly end life on Earth unless it is that her statement went unremarked by those keeping score. 
The Nobel Mistake 
Less than nine months into Barack Obamaâ€™s presidency, Norwayâ€™s Nobel Institute bestowed the Nobel Peace Prize on him largely on the strength of his pledge during his first major foreign policy speech in Prague to rid the world of nuclear weapons. In a 2015 memoir, former secretary of the Institute Geir Lundestad expressed remorse for doing so, saying â€œ[We] thought that it would strengthen Obama and it didnâ€™t have that effect.â€ President Barack Obama uncomfortably accepting the Nobel Peace Prize from Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Oslo, Norway, Dec. 10, 2009. (White House photo) 
Like all modern presidents, Obama quickly learned the political economy of the entrenched nuclear establishment, committing a trillion dollars to the â€œmodernizationâ€ of the arsenal and its delivery systems 30 years beyond his presidency. 
As Obama prepared to leave office, his Defense Secretary Ashton Carter rejected pleas for reducing the stockpile and announced that the Pentagon planned to spend $108 billion over five years to â€œcorrect decades of underinvestment in nuclear deterrence â€¦ dat[ing] back to the Cold War.â€ The last Cold War, that is. 
Such staggering expenditures are, however, even more unlikely to purchase the order and security that Secretary Carter promised than when Mumford issued his warning. That was well before thousands of thermonuclear weapons waited on hair-trigger alert for the order to launch or a glitch that would do so without an order. 
In his recently published book My Journey At the Nuclear Brink , Bill Clintonâ€™s Defense Secretary William Perry detailed the numerous close calls by which the world has dodged partial or all-out Armageddon and claimed that the likelihood of disaster is growing rather than diminishing. Most of these events are unknown to the public. 
Former head of the U.S. Strategic Command General James Cartwright bolstered Perryâ€™s claim when he told a San Francisco audience that â€œIt makes no sense to keep our nuclear weapons online 24 hours a dayâ€ since â€œYouâ€™ve either been hacked and are not admitting it, or youâ€™re being hacked and donâ€™t know it.â€ One of those hackers, he said, could get lucky. 
A Non-existent Debate 
When Hillary Clinton was asked at a town hall event in Concord, New Hampshire, if she would reduce expenditures for nuclear arms and rein in the corporations that sell the government those weapons, she replied â€œI think we are overdue for a very thorough debate in our country about what we need and how we are willing to pay for it.â€ Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix, Arizona.   by Gage Skidmore) 
Such a debate has never been held and â€” given the peril, complexity and cost of nuclear technology â€” it is never likely to happen unless a president of exceptional courage and independence demands it. The profits of weapons production are simply too great and few of the prospective victims understandably want to dwell on the unthinkable when so much more diverting entertainment is available on their Smartphones. 
Nuclear weapons by their nature are inimical to transparency and thus to the public discussion, control and democracy they ostensibly protect. Nor does Doomsday make for winning dinner banter. 
The Brookings Institute in 1998 published a study of the cumulative costs of nuclear weapons entitled Atomic Audit . It put the bill to date at $5.5 trillion, virtually none of which was known by the public or even to members of Congress or the President. The cost simply grew and continues to grow in the dark, precluding spending on so much else that might otherwise return in public works and services to those who unwittingly pay for the weapons while also mitigating the causes of war abroad. 
If she wins, Hillary Clintonâ€™s election to the Presidency will be hailed as historic, but not nearly as historic as if she would sponsor that â€œoverdueâ€ and â€œvery thorough debateâ€ of which she spoke in the city of Concord. Such a debate might begin to lift from her own shoulders â€” and from those of her successors if there are to be any â€” what she called â€œthe awesome responsibilityâ€ of four minutes to launch. That way lies sanity after 70 years of its opposite. 
Dr. Gray Brechin is the Project Scholar of the Living New Deal University at the UC Berkeley Department of Geography. He is the author of Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin which explains the historical context of Californiaâ€™s long but little-known involvement with nuclear weaponry."

The man â€” who has been identified only as Ghazia A. â€” is allowed to have multiple wives under Muslim tradition, but only if he can support them financially. 
Upon emigrating to Germany, where polygamy is not officially permitted but officials have been 'looking the other way,' Ghazia was forced to choose just one of his four wives as his â€œmainâ€ wife. 
He then split up his 22 children â€” one has since married and moved to Saudi Arabia â€” among the other three. These family members were placed in neighboring homes, some up to 31 miles away. 
Ghazia explained to German newspaper Das Bild how his wide-ranging family responsibilities have left him unable to work: 
""According to our religion I have the duty to visit each family equally and not to prioritize any of them. 
I am practically always on my way to be with my family â€” yet I would gladly like to work.""

Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign has exposed and spoken to the real pain and profound alienation of many Americans, but the candidate also has exploited those emotions with lies and appeals to prejudice, says Michael Winship. 
By Michael Winship 
When I grow up, I want to be Charlie Pierce , who covers politics for Esquire magazine and has toiled in our scrivenerâ€™s trade, as far as I can tell, since the late 1970s. 
I know, technically, heâ€™s a couple of years younger than I am, but he writes with the fierce wit and well-aimed anger to which I aspire, and as this wheezing milk train of a presidential campaign clanks into the final station, few have been as perceptive when it comes to trying to figure out just what the hell has happened to America this year. Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Photo credit: Grant Miller/RNC) 
Charlie Pierce has done so with great style throughout, but now, thanks to Donald Trump and just hours before Election Day, he has come to the end of his watchdog rope. He wrote on Saturday that Trump â€” to whom he refers as El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago â€” had â€œmanaged to exceed even my admittedly expansive limits for political obscenity.â€ 
Pierce was talking about Trumpâ€™s reaction after President Obama responded to an elderly heckler wearing a military tunic at a Friday campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. 
As the crowd booed the man, Obama said, â€œHey! Listen up! I told you to be focused, and youâ€™re not focused right now. Listen to what Iâ€™m saying. Hold up. Hold up! â€¦ Everybody sit down, and be quiet for a secondâ€¦ First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he mightâ€™ve served in our military and we got to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly and we got to respect our elders. And fourth of all, donâ€™t boo, vote.â€ 
In other words, the President showed poise, grace and yes, class. But shortly after, hereâ€™s how the moment was seen through Trumpâ€™s eyes at a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania: â€œThere was a protester and a protester that likes us,â€ Trump said. â€œAnd what happened is they wouldnâ€™t put the cameras on him. They kept the cameras on Obama. â€¦ He was talking to a protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say he became unhinged.â€ 
Unhinged? Really? We all know that Trump seems to get his news from an implanted electrode picking up propaganda signals from the Planet Mongo. But there comes a point when the lies piled upon lies become too much for even the fairest and most equable of us. Hearing Trumpâ€™s demonstrably false description of what happened at Obamaâ€™s rally, Charlie Pierce finally had it. 
â€œMaybe it was because it was so ludicrously provable a lie,â€ he wrote. â€œ[Trump] didnâ€™t care. He never has cared. His contempt for the democratic processes and for the norms of self-government is matched only by the deep contempt he has for all the suckers who mistake his contempt for the American experiment for their deep disappointment in it. He has measured their intelligence by his heavily leveraged net worth and found them hilariously lacking. 
â€œWe are all the subcontractors who build his indomitable ego for him and, as such, he can stiff us according to his customary business plan. His campaign long ago became a sickening charade performed by a grotesque charlatan.â€ 
The Scene in Reno 
And so it is. Look, too, at how Trump and his followers at a rally in Reno, Nevada, on Saturday responded to a man with a â€œRepublicans against Trumpâ€ sign. Before someone shouted â€œGun!â€ and the moment turned even uglier, Trump had looked down and said, â€œOh we have one of those guys from the Hillary Clinton campaign. How much are you being paid, $1,500?â€ As the crowd booed, Trump said, â€œOkay. Take him out.â€ The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads â€œVote Trumpâ€ on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
The protester, a Reno resident named Austyn Crites, described himself as Republican and a fiscal conservative. He told The Guardian he was grateful to the police who removed him from the auditorium for interrogation â€” they kept him from being further kicked, choked and pummeled by the gang of Trump supporters who surrounded him. 
Still, he said, â€œThe people who attacked me â€” Iâ€™m not blaming them. Iâ€™m blaming Donald Trumpâ€™s hate rhetoric, â€¦ The fact that I got beat up today, thatâ€™s just showing what heâ€™s doing to his crowds.â€ 
Throughout the campaign, whenever Trump has egged on his followers, Iâ€™ve thought of that line in Young Frankenstein, when the angry Transylvanian villagers are told by the local police inspector, â€œA riot is an ugly thing, and I think that it is just about time we had one.â€ 
Remember what Trump said when a protester was dragged out of a February rally in Las Vegas: â€œI love the old days â€” you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? Theyâ€™d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. â€¦ Iâ€™d like to punch him in the face.â€ 
By now, youâ€™ve heard it all before and the litany of lies, outrageous claims and insults has climbed so high that many of us have become numb and weary from the sheer repetition of Trumpâ€™s buffoonery. You can only go to so many demolition derbies before the sight of flaming car wrecks becomes routine. 
Dog Whistles 
Whatâ€™s more, you can argue that far more insidious and frightening are the dog whistle attacks appealing to the baser instincts of the bigoted and ignorant. The latest: the closing ad from the Trump campaign that, with anti-Semitic overtones, points fingers at â€œa global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class.â€ Former   speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. March 21, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
As Josh Marshall notes at Talking Points Memo , â€œThe four readily identifiable American bad guys in the ad are Hillary Clinton, George Soros (Jewish financier), Janet Yellen (Jewish Fed Chair) and Lloyd Blankfein (Jewish Goldman Sachs CEO)â€¦ This is an ad intended to appeal to anti-Semites and spread anti-Semitic ideasâ€¦ This is intentional and by design. It is no accident.â€ 
Here is something Charlie Pierce wrote back in May . Trump, he said, â€œis riding on a wave of pain that he never has felt.â€ 
â€œHe is riding on a wave of anxiety he never has encountered. Beyond their love of him, there is no indication that he is as deeply aware of what has powered his rise as the people whose fear, and doubt, and, yes, hatred has powered his rise. Their job is still to wait in line, cheer on cue, and give him the devotion that he has earned because, after all, he is He, Trump, and theyâ€™re not, and that will never change.â€ 
Add it all up and to me, this is what it comes down to: Do you want to live in a United States where anger, prejudice and fear rule, and dissent is viewed as treason, or in a country where we try to meet every issue from terrorism to education with clear eyes and a rational mind? 
This yearâ€™s choices are far from perfect, but nonetheless a choice must be made. To quote a founding father who believed in such things: liberty, once lost, is lost forever. This could be democracyâ€™s last stop. Vote.

21037,Why Most People Are Deficient In Magnesium: The Signs and What You Can Do,REALdeal,"Osteoporosis (yes, magnesium is more important than calcium for bone health!) Diabetes Kidney Stones â€œSimilarly, patients with diagnoses of depression, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, tremor, Parkinsonism, arrhythmias, circulatory disturbances (stroke, cardiac infarction, arteriosclerosis), hypertension, migraine, cluster headache, cramps, neuro-vegetative disorders, abdominal pain, osteoporosis, asthma, stress dependent disorders, tinnitus, ataxia, confusion, preeclampsia, weakness, might also be consequences of the magnesium deficiency syndrome.â€ â€“ Journal of the American College of Nutrition 
Amazingly, the article referenced above even mentions neuro-vegetative disorders as a possible result of magnesium deficiency. This would include comas. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences can immediately lead to complete depletion of magnesium stores; could this be a contributing factor to why we see comas after traumatic accidents/injuries? As I mentioned above, magnesium is an electrolyte responsible for brain signals and conductivity. Without magnesium, people in comas may not be able to come to and resume conductivity. Many people with diabetes also fall into diabetic comas. Diabetes is listed as another possible consequence of magnesium deficiency. Could this be a factor in diabetic comas as well? Something to think about and research further! 
Cravings 
Do you crave chocolate? Why, when people are stressed out, do they go for chocolate? Chocolate is one of the highest food sources of magnesium. 
Magnesium is associated with so many disorders that Dr. Carolyn Dean of the Nutritional Magnesium Association has devoted an entire book to discussing how she has treated thousands of patients for a wide array of diseases, with magnesium as the primary component. Her book, The Magnesium Miracle, is a must-read if you have any of the magnesium deficiency symptoms above, or any health problems in general â€“ as there is likely a magnesium component to everything. Check out 50 Studies Suggest That Magnesium Deficiency Is Killing Us . 
Why Donâ€™t Doctors Find Magnesium Deficiencies In Tests? 
Unfortunately, conventional medicine has not woken up to the amount of research that has been done on magnesium deficiency. 
One of the reasons Western Medicine is so off base with magnesium is how they test it: with blood tests. 
Blood tests do not yield ANY information about magnesium â€¦ why? Because the body controls the levels of blood magnesium very tightly. If the magnesium in the blood drops just a little bit, youâ€™re going to have a heart attack. Itâ€™s that sample. So to prevent this, the body will rob all of its cells, tissues, and bones of magnesium in order to keep the blood levels constant. If you do a blood test for magnesium, the cells could be completely empty while your blood levels remain constant. 
Whatâ€™s worse is that magnesium is not even in your blood. 99% of the magnesium in the body is stored in the cells that get robbed, while a mere 1% of your bodyâ€™s total magnesium is in the blood. These tests are a complete waste of time, and theyâ€™re not educating doctors to this reality. 
â€œA serum test for magnesium is actually worse than ineffective, because a test result that is within normal limits lends a false sense of security about the status of the mineral in the body. It also explains why doctors donâ€™t recognize magnesium deficiency; they assume serum magnesium levels are an accurate measure of all the magnesium in the body.â€ â€“ Dr. Carolyn Dean, The Magnesium Miracle. 
Why Are We So Deficient? 
Hereâ€™s the short(ish) version: Number one , weâ€™re being poisoned by our food. Number two , weâ€™re increasingly stressed out. Weâ€™re running our engines on high to keep up with life and itâ€™s draining us. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences lead to depletion of magnesium stores. Number three , weâ€™re eating more sugar than ever. For every molecule of sugar we consume, our bodies use 54 molecules of magnesium to process it. Fourth , low levels in the soil and modern farming techniques deplete stores of magnesium. And lastly, magnesium is depleted by many pharmaceutical drugs and estrogen compounds such as oral contraceptives, antibiotics, cortisone, prednisone, and blood pressure medications (â€œDrug-induced nutrient depletion handbook,â€ Pelton, 2001). Diuretics in coffee and tea (caffeine) also raise excretion levels. Oh and by the way â€“ flouride competes for absorption with magnesium! 
Nowadays, nearly everyone is magnesium deficient â€“ no test needed. Refined/processed foods are stripped of their mineral, vitamin, and fiber content. These are anti-nutrient foods because they actually steal magnesium in order to be metabolized. When consumed, they demand that we supplement with magnesium or we are destined to break down eventually due to severe deficiency. Like I said, sugar is the worst offender. Every single molecule of sugar you consume drags over 50 times the amount of magnesium out of your body. 
Well, what if you eat a healthy diet? Processed products are not the only foods that are devoid of magnesium. In general, magnesium has been depleted from topsoil, diminishing dietary intake across the board while our need for magnesium has increased, due to the high levels of toxic exposure we come across in our daily lives (air, water, plastics, chemicals, the list goes on!). The soil is depleted of magnesium because of the pesticides that are sprayed on all conventionally grown plants and worldwide pollution that affects even the cleanest fields. Pesticides also kill those beneficial bacteria/fungi that are necessary in order for plants to convert soil nutrients into plant nutrients usable by humans. 
Are You A Cannabis User? 
Cannabis has so many positive effects in terms of treating diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, and more (read 1 , 2 , 3 and cureyourowncancer.org ). Trust me, Iâ€™ll be the first to tell you Iâ€™m all for it â€“ itâ€™s a safe and effective herb with countless therapeutic benefits that the government has been hiding for years. The only way they want you using it is if theyâ€™ve patented one of itsâ€™ chemical compounds and can sell it to you for a profit. 
However, we should also look at what happens to our body on a cellular level if we use cannabis on a daily basis. Would you take parasite cleansing herbs every day for the rest of your life, or even every few days? Probably not. Youâ€™d take them when youâ€™re sick or during a monthly cleanse, or else youâ€™d develop some side effects from overuse. We need to remember that cannabis is a powerful herbal medicine and should be treated in such a way. 
It turns out that using marijuana tends to deplete the bodyâ€™s stores of magnesium, with the result that the person feels more on-edge after coming down from the high. 
Of course, that doesnâ€™t mean that it isnâ€™t safe in moderation. It means that over time, if used consistently without proper balance via magnesium replenishment, it can and will cause magnesium deficiency. 
The Best Ways To Get Magnesium 
1. Eat magnesium rich foods grown on organic soil. 
2. Take ionic magnesium drops. This is my new favorite method, which Iâ€™ve learned from The Magnesium Miracle. 
3. Apply magnesium oil to your skin! This is the second best way to raise your levels. 
4. Soak in epsom salt baths. This will provide not only magnesium, but sulfur for your liver as well.

21039,Dem: Charge Republican Who Took Down Anti-Cop Painting - Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,"Representative Lacy Clay (  ) wants Representative Duncan Hunter (  ) to face â€œtheftâ€ charges for removing an   painting from the walls of the U. S. Capitol complex. [Breitbart News previously reported that the painting was hung in the Capitol complex after Clay chose it as a fitting representation of the August 9, 2014, shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. It depicts police officers as animals with tusks.  On January 6 Hunter removed the painting from the wall, saying, â€œIâ€™ve seen the press [reporting on this painting] for about a week or so.   â€¦     Iâ€™m in the Marine Corps. If you want it done, just call us. â€ Hunter then delivered the painting to Clayâ€™s office and said, â€œLacy can put it back up, I guess, if he wants to   â€¦     but Iâ€™m allowed to take it down. â€ Clay now wants â€œtheftâ€ charges against Hunter. According to The Washington Post, Clay addressed the removal of the painting on Monday, saying that â€œhis staff met Monday with members of the Capitol Police to press theft charges against Rep. Duncan D. Hunter. â€ Clay added, â€œHe had no right to take that picture down, itâ€™s thievery. â€ Clay plans to rehang the   painting on January 10 and will be accompanied by the Congressional Black Caucus while doing it. The artist behind the painting is David Pulphus. Clay defended Pulphusâ€™ animal representation of officers in Ferguson, saying: These are his impressions. Those are his feelings. Thatâ€™s how he formed his opinion, and he expressed it in his art. So whatâ€™s wrong with that? Any black parent would tell you that they have to have this conversation with their children about police and how to act around them, so thatâ€™s the conversation we need to be having here. Not about taking some kidâ€™s picture off the wall  â€”   it should be about, how do we change these attitudes and improve the relationships between police and the black community? The schism between Clay and Hunter over attitudes toward police officers is a microcosm of the larger divide that exists between the Democrat Party and the Republican Party. For example, during the 2016 presidential race the National Fraternal Order of Police (NFOP) sent Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton a questionnaire to answer.

21041,"Clinton Scandal Avalanche: Bombshells Too Numerous to Cover, Too Unspeakable to Mention",William F. Jasper,"From: Marina Abramovic <marinaxabramovic@gmail.com<;mailto:marinaxabramovic@gmail.com>;> Date: June 28, 2015 at 2:35:08 AM GMT+2 To: Tony Podesta <podesta@podesta.com<;mailto:podesta@podesta.com>;> Subject: Dinner Dear Tony, I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina 
There is much more to the Abramovic-Podesta-Clinton connection than this one e-mail and the social event it makes reference to â€” and much more than we can cover in this article. However, the MSM pro-Clinton press corps has studiously avoided these ties, except in the few instances where they have ventured into the cesspool to declare that there really is no â€œcessâ€ there. That was the tack taken by Eric Levitz in a November 4 piece for New York Magazine , a reliable cheering section for Team Hillary throughout the campaign season. Entitled, â€œSpirit Cooking Explained: Satanic Ritual of Fun Dinner?â€ Levitz describes Tony Podesta as â€œa powerful lobbyist and ... a prominent collector of contemporary art.â€ â€œThe message here is, ostensibly, a dinner invitation that makes playful reference to one of Abramovicâ€™s past works,â€ writes Levitz . 
Yes, just a â€œplayful,â€ â€œfun dinner,â€ thatâ€™s all. But, according to Levitz, the â€œtin-foil hatâ€ conspiracy wackos of the â€œfar-right fever swampâ€ have turned this innocent dinner gathering of the Podesta clan and their artistic muse into something sinister. Well, Mr. Levitz â€” like the Podestas, the Clintons, Lady Gaga, and Abramovic â€” apparently hales from a different precinct (if not a completely different planet or universe) than most normal, moral, decent Americans, who would be inclined to find the Abramovic dinner â€œartâ€ both creepy and sinister. Levitz is not unaware of Abramovicâ€™s ultra-dark side; he includes an imbedded video in his article of her performing her infamous Spirit Cooking . (Warning: graphic content, viewer discretion advised.) 
The New York mag writer slams the Alex Jones/Info Wars website and Drudge Report for making an issue of these innocuous goings on; theyâ€™re obviously unsophisticated rubes with no appreciation for high-toned culture, right? There ainâ€™t no Satanists here, you fools, just artistic types enjoying some campy fun. Right? Well, Drudge and Jones are probably a lot closer to the mark than Levitz. Besides the Spirit Cooking video, Alex Jones includes (among other evidence) a Marina Abramovic portrait (shown above) in which she frames her face with the horns of a bloody goat skull, the symbol of Baphomet, one of the most common Satanic images. Other portraits of the â€œartistâ€ can be found online showing her with a mouthful of live snakes, as well as her signature fixation on death, cannibalism, and â€” in general â€” the lewd, crude, nude, and rude. 
Marina Abramovic, an unquenchable narcissist, apparently is unsettled by the sudden critical attention, since she is used to being worshipped and fawned over. On November 4, she exploded with the Tweets: â€œI am not a Satanist! Stop it!â€ and â€œMy friends, please stop twittering me with tag spiritcooking! Just enjoy art and stop asking me about politics.â€ Unfortunately for her, she must have forgotten that her Twitter account she used in an attempt to dispel the Spirit Cooking occultism, is â€œ@AbramovicM666.â€ Probably not the wisest move sheâ€™s made. 
(For an additional spirited and rational discussion of the Spirit Cooking e-mails and their related â€œcontext,â€ see also: Spirit Cooking: Evil In Government: Mike Cernovich, Vox Day and Stefan Molyneux .) 
The Clinton-Podesta-Abramovic tie-in might be written off by many doubters as merely a titillating, sensational election-eve story scraped up by political opponents. However, it cannot be written off so easily because it goes to the heart of darkness of the Clinton â€œorganized crime cesspoolâ€ that the FBIâ€™s former assistant director James Kallstrom referred to. 
It comes on the heels of a long train of verified stories that are interrelated, most especially regarding criminal activities with minors and children. There is, for starters, the long-running close relationship between hedge fund billionaire (and convicted pedophile) Jeffrey Epstein, whose Manhattan mansion and private island estate in the Caribbean have been the sites for many notorious sex parties â€” especially for Democratic politicians, celebrities, and high-end political donors. Bill and Hillary Clinton, reportedly, have made multiple trips to Epsteinâ€™s lair, known as â€œSex Slave Island,â€ which offers a luxurious getaway excursion outside the jurisdiction of authorities who might get in the way of sexual frolicking with teens â€” and even younger kids. 
Hillary Clintonâ€™s ties to Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner and the most recent revelations coming from his computer underscore the fact that at the highest levels of power in Washington, D.C., top officals of both parties for many years have been winking at the criminal sexual exploitation of children by politicians and their high-placed friends. Only rarely do the offenses leak out in a way that ends up with prosecution of the powerful, as in the case of Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, a serial abuser of teenage boys. But, as we have reported, Hastert was just the tip of the iceberg . 
Related to this same subject matter are e-mails between Hillary Clinton and her then-top aide Cheryl Mills regarding one Laura Silsby, who was arrested and charged with child abduction and child trafficking in Haiti, after the island was devastated by a hurricane in January 2010. Silsby and nine others posing as missionaries for a non-existent Christian orphanage were apprehended by authorities while attempting to smuggle a busload of 33 Haitian children off the island. Turns out they werenâ€™t orphans after all, and their parents accused Silsby of deception. Silsbyâ€™s attorney was convicted felon Jorge Torres Puello, who, at the time, was a fugitive from U.S. authorities for alien smuggling. That should have sent up a red flag or two! (Torres Puello was subsequently captured, prosecuted, and sentenced to three years in U.S. federal prison for alien smuggling .) 
However, thanks to intercession by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton (who was serving as special UN envoy to Haiti, as well as ramrodding his own very profitable Clinton Foundation ventures in the tragedy-struck island), Laura Silsbyâ€™s charges were reduced and she was allowed to leave Haiti with time served. 
Some analysts and critics have suggested that Silsby was kidnapping the Haitian children to be sold to child sex rings. The evidence we have seen thus far does not prove that claim, but neither is it a far-fetched supposition, considering the sordid sexual swamp that many of the high and mighty are mired in, and considering the Epstein-Clinton-Podesta revelations that are pouring out. At the very least, it must be seriously investigated, in light of the evidence available and the global crisis in child sex trafficking. 
But here, as in virtually every other scandal that has embroiled Hillary Clinton, her establishment media pals have given her a Teflon shield. Ditto for the revelations by Kathy Shelton of Arkansas, who, as a 12-year-old, was raped in 1975 by a 41-year-old drifter. Hillary Clinton was his defense lawyer. In a later interview, Clinton laughed as she recalled how she had gotten her child-rapist client off with some courtroom tricks. Moreover, as the victim recounts, Hillary made it appear that the 12-year-old Shelton was the one at fault. â€œHillary Clinton lied, terrorized, & mocked me, defending my rapist,â€ Shelton has tweeted. 
While the latest WikiLeaks releases related to sensational sexual matters are grabbing the headlines of the alternative media (and being ignored by the MSM), literally dozens of other hot issues exposed by WikiLeaks from the Clinton-Podesta e-mails have been either totally buried or hugely under-reported by the Clintonista press corps. In addition to the WikiLeaks revelations (and related exposÃ©s) that we have covered in the articles listed below this story, we point you to a helpful summary of several dozen Clinton scandals compiled by Montana researcher activist Clarice Ryan for the Gem State Patriot . In addition, there is a more detailed, annotated online resource with URL links entitled, â€œThe Top 100 Most Damaging Wikileaks (so far)â€ that is a helpful guide to the thousands of leaked e-mails.

21042,Trump and Betsy DeVos Deliver Disparate Messages in First 100 Days - Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,"President Donald Trump made the end of Common Core and the return to local control of education the primary items of his campaignâ€™s education agenda, but the woman leading his education department claims Common Core has not existed in the countryâ€™s schools since 2015. [I will end common core. Itâ€™s a disaster. https:  . #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 pic. twitter.   â€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2016,   On Monday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said, â€œThere really isnâ€™t any Common Core anymore,â€ citing the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) which was passed in 2015. ESSA, she claims, â€œdoes away with the whole argument about Common Core. â€ The secretaryâ€™s comments came just several weeks after Trump returned to his   campaign statement that he wanted to end Common Core and make education policy once again the domain of state and local governments. â€œCommon Core, I mean, we have to bring education more local,â€ Trump said at the White House. â€œWe canâ€™t be managing education from Washington. â€ The president continued: When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally and theyâ€™ll do a much better job  â€¦     And I like the fact of getting rid of Common Core. You know, Common Core, to me, we have to end it. We have to bring education local, to me. Iâ€™ve always said it, Iâ€™ve been saying it during the campaign, and weâ€™re doing it. While campaigning in 2016  â€”   after the enactment of ESSA  â€”   Trump listened to millions of grassroots parents and teachers who asked him to cut off federal funding for and end the superstructures that made Common Core possible in the first place. â€œCommon Core is a disaster,â€ Trump noted time and again. While he provided few details of his education plan, he acknowledged the frustration of parents in their attempt to eradicate the Common Core system of math and English language arts standards and tests, and the accompanying massive student data collection, in their states. â€œFor the first time in any presidential campaign, an education issue claimed a place of importance with grassroots citizens,â€ writes American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins at the Library of Law and Liberty, explaining the basis for the grassrootsâ€™ ire at the progressive Common Core policies: In the early days of Common Core, almost no one outside the federal and state education bureaucracies or the insular world of â€œeducation reformâ€ had ever heard of it â€”  even though the standards would ignite the largest   grassroots movement in American history. Common Core was adopted by state executive branch officials in response to â€œincentivesâ€ from federal executive branch officials, with (in almost every case) no consent from or even notice to elected state legislators. In a joint statement to Breitbart News, parent activists Heidi Huber of Ohio and Jenni White of Oklahoma agree â€œthe very reason   billionaire Donald Trump appealed to the everyday   Core mom is because he appeared to understand the kitchen table politics of grassroots America. â€ Toward the end of his campaign, Trumpâ€™s message about ending Common Core was overshadowed by a new message about school choice  â€”   one that received significant attention with the announcement of DeVos as his selection for federal education secretary. DeVos had been a major backer of school choice and school vouchers in her home state of Michigan. She had also been a supporter of Jeb Bush and his education foundation, and, ultimately, served as an   delegate for establishment Republican candidate John Kasich at the GOP convention. Meanwhile, grassroots parent groups in Michigan also noted that DeVos lent financial and service support to organizations that promoted the Common Core. Upon her nomination by Trump, however, DeVos denied she supported the Core. â€œI do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control,â€ she said. â€œWhen Governors such as John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense. â€ DeVosâ€™s nomination was accompanied by a level of controversy rarely seen for an education secretary. The left  â€”   led by teachers unions  â€”   began to work against her because of her support for school choice which, they claimed, would redirect funding from public schools. The mainstream media focused its energy on the battle between its own leftwing public school supporters and â€œconservativeâ€ DeVos. As the left often does, it also often made the decision to mock the secretary unfairly, rather than deal with her on the actual issues. After a very shaky confirmation process  â€”   which required Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie vote in the Senate  â€”   DeVos was finally confirmed. But the controversy continued within the GOP as the secretary began to fill her department with many individuals with ties to   Core Jeb Bush, as well as Indiana  â€”   where Common Core was â€œrepealed,â€ but then simply â€œrebrandedâ€ with a new name. Trumpâ€™s constitutionalist base continued the drumbeat on eliminating the U. S. Education Department and Washington bureaucratsâ€™ influence on local education policy. Two bills were introduced in Congress with that end in mind, one by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) and the other by North Carolina Rep. David Rouzer (R). Though DeVos has continued with comments that Common Core is no longer an issue because of its elimination through ESSA, those who have studied the federal law and observed the secretaryâ€™s choice of staffers say her comments are typical of the establishment GOP. According to Huber and White, â€œTrumpâ€™s selection of Betsy DeVos was not only disappointing, it telegraphed more of the same tone deafness of the previous administration. â€ â€œBetsy DeVos was confirmed and began assembling a team of staffers, most of whom represent pretty establishment Republican experience and positions,â€ Joy Pullman, managing editor at The Federalist, also tells Breitbart News. The author of a newly released book, The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids, Pullman notes that while school choice is a positive goal, the idea that the federal government should be involved in regulating it in any way suggests the Trump education department is not planning on reducing its influence, as Trump had originally promised. She explains: Everyone without financial or political incentives to the contrary, such as teachers unions, knows that choice exists and it generally works. The real conversation is whether government will destroy it by using laws and regulations to commandeer private and charter options or stay true to the promise of the word â€œchoiceâ€ and truly let parents control the style and content of their childrenâ€™s curricula. Many questions remain unanswered about the Trump administrationâ€™s leadership on these issues, and there has been absolutely no action on Trumpâ€™s repeated campaign pledge to â€œeliminate Common Core. â€ On the plus side, Trump signed legislation in March that, via the Congressional Review Act, rolled back two   education policies  â€”   one regarding teacher training programs, and another regarding meeting some ESSA directives. The ESSA rule concerned statesâ€™ accountability in identifying failing schools and reporting their plans for improving them to the federal government. Nevertheless, ESSA still requires states to submit their overall education plans to the U. S. Education Department. In March, DeVosâ€™s office released a new guide on how states may fulfill their requirement to the federal government. The guide features a â€œrevised templateâ€ offered by the education department itself, and adds that two private groups  â€”   the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association  â€”   both of which own the copyright to the Common Core standards, may assist states with an â€œalternative template. â€ Ann Marie Banfield, education liaison with the New   Cornerstone Research and Policy Institute, tells Breitbart News DeVosâ€™s messages are at odds with how Trump campaigned on education issues: Trump campaigned with the promise to get rid of Common Core and even referenced Gov. Jeb Bush as someone who supported the federal education reform that parents never asked for. The appointment of Betsy DeVos has left many of us underwhelmed and disappointed. You donâ€™t appoint a Jeb Bush crony and expect parents whoâ€™ve been fighting against Common Core to be thrilled. In February, conflict between Trump and DeVos was reported by the New York Times, as the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned Obamaâ€™s   directive, which effectively permitted children to change their sex by simply declaring they have the â€œgender identityâ€ of the other sex. DeVos reportedly objected to changing Obamaâ€™s policy, but was overruled by Trump and Sessions. Pullman observes that Trumpâ€™s rollback of Obamaâ€™s Title IX guidance is â€œa win, but it was done over the objections of Secretary DeVos, which is worrisome. â€ â€œEven if you think itâ€™s okay to force naked boy bodies and naked girl bodies into the same private facilities, the federal government has no authority to do what Obamaâ€™s Education and Justice departments did in this regard,â€ she adds. â€œWe would ask president Trump  â€”   as he completes the first 100 days of his administration  â€”   to consider the tens of thousands of parents who believed his promise to end Common Core, and implore him to invite leading parent activists to the table,â€ say Huber and White. â€œIt would undoubtedly benefit President Trump, but more importantly, it would serve the children he promised to deliver from the special interests of the FedEd complex. â€ Emmett McGroarty, senior fellow at American Principles Project, tells Breitbart News DeVos is not supporting Trump in his stated education agenda. â€œSecretary DeVos is undermining the Trump presidency,â€ he asserts. â€œGreat presidents have a great vision and are able to bring it into reality. That invariably means overcoming the timid in their own administration and in Congress. Thatâ€™s the hurdle President Trump faces. â€"

21044,How Salon Gets Away with Deceiving Its Readers | OffGuardian,Investigative Historian Eric Zuesse Is The Author,"written by Admin by Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org Before I start this condemnation of lies from â€˜liberalâ€™ â€˜newsâ€™ media, I should indicate that I am a former lifelong Democrat who left the Party over the corruption of the Obama Administration when the corruption became capped by their Democratic National Committee using many devices to steal the Presidential nomination away from Bernie Sanders, to hand it to Obamaâ€™s chosen successor Hillary Clinton, whom Obama expected would complete his pro-Wall-Street legacy by passing into law some version of his trade treaties and by Hillaryâ€™s conquering Russia, the latter of which goal was a U.S. government project that had actually started in secret on the night of 24 February 1990 when the then-President George Herbert Walker Bush initiated what has since become a ceaseless behind-the-scenes U.S. government program to expand NATO right up to Russiaâ€™s borders and ultimately to conquer Russia itself. Though the Cold War ended authentically on Russiaâ€™s side in 1991, it never really did end on the U.S. side (that was just a lie) â€” and Obama-Clinton were hoping soon to culminate the U.S. aristocracyâ€™s conquest of Russia. I remain a committed progressive journalist but am no longer committed to any political party, because now both of the major political parties are vile and no third party in a Presidential system of government stands a realistic chance of controlling either the Executive branch or the Legislative branch of government â€” its only function is to serve as â€œspoilerâ€ for one or the other of the two. So: I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican, nor a supporter of some â€˜thirdâ€™ Party, but remain unchanged throughout, consistently a progressive, which means totally dedicated to truth and against lies (such as dominate all forms of conservatism). My criticisms of â€˜newsâ€™media reflect that, no political-party orientation. 
On November 9th, Salonâ€™s reporter Brendan Gauthier headlined Salonâ€™s top-of-homepage headline of the day, â€œIn Donald Trumpâ€™s cabinet from hell, corporatism and cronyism run rampant â€” and Sarah Palin may be there, tooâ€ and reported what was at the time speculation that was sourced to an NBC news report, titled â€œGingrich, Giuliani, Priebus Eyed for Top Jobs in Trump White House: Sourcesâ€ , which stated that: 
Among the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary. 
Trump himself has not taken an active part in transition efforts, in part out of superstition: He fears too much planning before a victory might jinx the campaign. In 2012, he was shocked to read detailed stories on Mitt Romneyâ€™s preparations for the White House long before election dayâ€¦ 
Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a loyal supporter, has taken a major role managing the transition effort, especially as the official transition chief, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, has drifted from the campaignâ€¦ 
Asked for comment on the above names floated for cabinet posts, Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks replied by e-mail that â€œnone of this is accurate.â€ 
Gauthier added nothing substantial to that NBC information (of which, maybe, â€œnone of this is accurateâ€) except to say such uninformative things as that Gingrich â€œproved himself a rabid Trump surrogateâ€ and as that Giuliani â€œhas been a tireless, if controversial, surrogate for Trump on the trail and in the media.â€ But in one instance Gauthier linked to a New York Post op-ed by Michael Flynn as being his source by which to allege regarding: â€œ Department of Defense Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn: Trumpâ€™s national security adviser was fired from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, which he attributed to his hawkishness.â€ 
That statement about Flynn is outright false. Here is all that Flynnâ€™s op-ed â€” Gauthierâ€™s cited source â€” actually said concerning his having been fired by Obama: 
Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some â€œniceties,â€ I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me). 
I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot. 
I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Departmentâ€¦ 
I was pissed but knew that I had maintained my integrity and was determined in the few months I had left to continue the changes I was instituting and to keep beating the drum about the vicious enemy we were facing (still are)â€¦ 
Weâ€™re in a global war, facing an enemy alliance that â€¦ picks up radical Muslim countries and organizations such as Iran, al Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic State. 
Thatâ€™s a formidable coalition, and nobody should be shocked to discover that we are losing the war. 
There was no indication whatsoever in the article, that Flynn had been fired on account of any â€œhawkishness.â€ That allegation by Salon was simply fabricated. 
The reality about Flynnâ€™s firing was the exact opposite: he was too â€˜dovishâ€™ to suit the neoconservative Barack Obama, who was now demanding that all of his top military generals support his goal of going to war against Russia. Flynn objected to that by saying that only one war at a time makes any sense, and that this war must be the defeat of jihadists, nothing else â€” certainly not a war against the other nuclear superpower. 
Rather than Flynnâ€™s support of Trump being a reflection of their shared â€˜hawkishnessâ€™, it reflects their strong belief that the view that Barack Obama holds and that Hillary Clinton holds even more strongly â€” that the war against jihadists must be subordinated to the war against Russia â€” is a totally upside-down view of the priorities, and that instead of the U.S. supporting jihadists who are warring against Russia and its allies, the U.S. ought to be supporting Russia and its allies who are warring against jihadists. 
If Salon wants to support the Obama-Clinton view and oppose the Trump view on the basis of truthful assertions, then thatâ€™s journalism and it is not mere political propaganda. 
But if Salon wants to deceive its readers into holding the political viewpoint that they hold, then what else is there to call Salon but a propaganda-site? "
21045,Sen. Chuck Schumer Goes Off on Trump Supporter at Fancy NYC Restaurant,Katherine Rodriguez,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) reportedly went on a tirade at a â€œswankyâ€ Manhattan restaurant Sunday night, screaming at a wealthy patron over her support for President Trump. [Schumer lost his temper when dining at Upper East Side restaurant Sette Mezzo, the New York Postâ€™s Page Six reported.  The top Senate Democrat was dining with friends when he ran into former U. S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. and his wife, Hilary, at the restaurant. Witnesses say that Schumer became incensed that Hilary, daughter of CBS founder and chairman William S. Paley, voted for Trump, though her husband is a prominent Democrat. â€œThey are a highly respected couple, and Schumer made a scene, yelling, â€˜She voted for Trump!â€™ The Califanos left the restaurant, but Schumer followed them outside,â€ one witness said of the encounter. â€œHow could you vote for Trump? Heâ€™s a liar! Heâ€™s a liar!â€ Schumer reportedly yelled. Hilary confirmed the encounter with Schumer and called the senatorâ€™s actions â€œreally rude. â€ â€œSen. Schumer was really rude   â€¦     Heâ€™s our senator, and I donâ€™t really like him. Yes, I voted for Trump. Schumer joined us outside and he told me Trump was a liar. I should have told him that Hillary Clinton was a liar, but I was so surprised I didnâ€™t say anything,â€ Hilary said. Another witness told a different story about Schumerâ€™s encounter with the couple, saying the senator approached the coupleâ€™s table first. â€œIt was a pleasant conversation. Joe said the senator was doing a good job on health care. Joe joked that Hilary voted for Trump. The conversation continued outside because everyone left at the same time,â€ the witness said. In a statement, Schumerâ€™s spokesperson denied that there was a heated encounter at the restaurant. â€œ[He] and his wife ate at the cafÃ© on Sunday, engaging in unremarkable conversation with patrons who approached their table. There were no heated exchanges with â€Žanyone,â€ the spokesperson said. Schumer has railed against the Trump administration, saying Sunday that President Trumpâ€™s proposal for a border wall will not get votes from Republicans or Democrats. He also called on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) to replace House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) and announced that Senate Democrats will filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuchâ€™s nomination to the Supreme Court."
21046,"When You Have to Go, Japanese Rest Stops Wonâ€™t Keep You Waiting - The New York Times",Motoko Rich,"The kids are hungry, the driver has a headache and everyone has to go to the bathroom. If youâ€™re traveling by car on a holiday weekend, the last thing you want to find at a roadside rest stop is a long line for a toilet. Companies that run major highway service plazas in Japan go to considerable lengths to ensure you never will, as they compete for the coveted Japan Toilet Award from the transportation ministry. Nexco Central Nippon Expressway, which runs 200 of the rest stops, promises that patrons should never have to wait more than two minutes to use the lavatory. The companyâ€™s   Neopasa Shimizu stop, one of several near Shizuoka City, about 15 miles from Mount Fuji, shows how. To keep things moving at Neopasa Shimizu, where 25, 000 people may stop on a busy weekend, there are 72 stalls in the ladiesâ€™ room, compared with 14 stalls and 32 urinals in the menâ€™s  â€”   a ratio meant to combat the longer waits that women often encounter in public facilities. Technology is put to work, too. A sensor in each stall detects whether it is in use, and relays that information to a large monitor screen mounted outside the restroom. Small icons even indicate whether the available toilets are the Western sitting style or the traditional Japanese squatting style. Of course, those who find these elaborate status panels too confusing can always just walk up and down the stalls, looking for an unlocked door."

21048,Measles Outbreak in Minnesota Within Somali Community Spreads Through State,Michael Patrick Leahy,"The recent measles outbreak in Minnesota, which was confined to 20 members of the Somali community in Hennepin County, part of the  . Paul metropolitan area, has now spread across the state. [â€œThe Minnesota Department of Health reports the stateâ€™s measles outbreak has spread from Hennepin County to Stearns County, totaling 29 cases, marking a new record,â€ KSTP reports.  â€œ  cases have been confirmed in the Somali community,â€ KSTP adds. The Minnesota Department of Health added that: â€œThe same number of cases [25] revealed the people affected were unvaccinated. However, in one case, the child had one MMR vaccination. â€ MDH reports 28 cases are confirmed in Hennepin County, and one case is in Stearns County. In the past 20 years, 2011 had the most cases with 26 total. The remaining cases have not been verified. All cases are children between the ages of 0 and 5. The city of St. Cloud, located about 65 miles northwest of Minneapolis, is the county seat of Stearns County. Breitbart News asked the Minnesota Department of Health if they could confirm if the four cases of the 29 that were not among the 25 â€œconfirmed in the Somali communityâ€ were in the general population not part of the Somali commuity. â€œNo  â€”   they simply havenâ€™t been verified yet,â€ a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health tells Breitbart News. â€œMost likely Somali. Thereâ€™s always a bit of a lag pending investigation,â€ the spokesperson adds. Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger blamed the measles outbreak on â€œmisinformationâ€ that was provided to the Minnesota Somali community, not on the health practices common in that community. â€œThis outbreak is about unvaccinated children, not specific communities. Unfortunately, the Minnesota Somali community has been targeted with misinformation about vaccine risks. Weâ€™re partnering with Somali community leaders and health care providers to counteract that misinformation,â€ Ehlinger said in a statement released by the Minnesota Department of Health earlier this month. â€œThere are people of all backgrounds around the state who have chosen not to protect themselves or their children. Often that decision is based on good intentions and inaccurate information. Itâ€™s the responsibility of all of us who care about the health of Minnesota children to make sure people have accurate information and take action to protect their families and their communities,â€ Ehlinger added in an additional statement issued by the Minnesota Department of Health on Monday. That statement also specifically addressed the Somali community in Minnesota: MDH also recommends that all Somali Minnesotan children statewide who have already received their first dose of MMR vaccine get their second dose now. This special vaccine schedule is commonly recommended during outbreaks instead of waiting until 4 to 6 years old for the second dose. Parents of Somali Minnesotan children should contact their childâ€™s health care provider and specifically tell them the child needs the MMR vaccine. This may help avoid a longer wait associated with scheduling a routine appointment.  . Paul is home to the largest Somali community in the United States, estimated to be around 70, 000. â€œSince FY 2002, 100, 246 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States, according to the State Departmentâ€™s interactive website. Of these, 99. 9 percent, or 99, 909, are Muslim,â€ Breitbart News reported in December. Assimilation of resettled Somalis in this country has been a significant problem, and continues to be so. In 2016, two Somali refugees, one in a Minnesota mall, the other at Ohio State University, attacked and injured more than 20 Americans. Both refugees were killed by law enforcement during the attacks. On the public health front, Somali refugees in Minnesota have been identified as responsible for 22 percent (161 out of 732) of the cases of active tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed between 2010 and 2014, despite accounting for about one percent of the stateâ€™s population, as Breitbart News reported. â€œHennepin County  is also the site of two recent cases of active tuberculosis at local public high schools . . . The letter to parents from St. Louis Park Public Schools informing them of the case of active TB in January was sent in three languages: English, Spanish, and Somali, â€ as Breitbart News reported. Recently, female genital mutilation (FGM) within the American Somali community has come to the forefront as a significant problem as well. Earlier this month, two doctors and another person were arrested in Livonia, Michigan on charges of conducting illegal FGM procedures on young Somali girls transported from Minnesota. In 2014, the Refugee Womens Health Center in Phoenix, Arizona told NBC News that 98 percent of all Somali women treated there (a total of 247 over five years between 2010 and 2014) were victims of FGM."
21050,"Texas County Enacts ""Emergency Paper Ballots"" After ""Software Glitch"" In Voting Machines",Tyler Durden,"  Texas County Enacts ""Emergency Paper Ballots"" After ""Software Glitch"" In Voting Machines Oct 26, 2016 1:50 PM 0 SHARES 
Just yesterday we noted several social media complaints from Texas voters who alleged that when they voted a straight republican ticket that voting machines were switching their presidential selection to Clinton/Kaine. While most undoubtedly dismissed these reports as conspiracy theories, new official reports from Chambers County, Texas suggest that there might be some truth to the voting machine ""irregularities"". According to an NBC affiliate , polling stations in Chambers County had to enact emergency protocols yesterday and revert back to paper ballots after a ""glitch"" was discovered in the county's voting machines. 
The issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in when she reviewed her electronic ballot Hawthorne told 12News on Tuesday. 

An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. 

ES&S is the vendor that Chambers County contracts with to program their voting machines. 

The Texas Secretary of State's office informed Hawthorne to create emergency paper ballots to continue voting until the problem could be fixed according to the release. 
Below is the official press release from the Chambers County Clerk: 

Of course, these confirmed reports from Chambers County seem eerily similar to problems reported yesterday on social media from people who also experienced problems when voting a ""straight republican ticket."" 

The following report also surfaced in Arlington, Texas from a person who voted a straight republican ticket only to find just before submitting her ballot that her presidential choice had been switched to Clinton/Kaine . After reporting the error to polling officials, the voter was told that these errors ""had been happening."" 

This Reddit user also noted multiple reports of voting errors across the state of Texas. 

Of course, the real question is how many people submitted erroneous ballots before this ""glitch"" was caught and how many other ""software glitches"" exist in other counties around the country that will never be caught?"

21052,Hereâ€™s what happened when a Hillary supporting MIT professor decided to analyze her emailsâ€¦,Michael Krieger,"VIDEOS Hereâ€™s what happened when a Hillary supporting MIT professor decided to analyze her emailsâ€¦ In practice, as recent history has repeatedly shown, the right to vote, by itself, is no guarantee of liberty By Michael Krieger - November 7, 2016 
A few days ago, Cesar A. Hidalgo published a very important article titled, What I Learned From Visualizing Hillary Clintonâ€™s Emails . 
So who is Cesar Hidalgo? CÃ©sar A. Hidalgo is associate professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab and the author of Why Information Grows: The evolution of order from atoms to economies. He has also lead the creation of data visualization sites that have received more than 100 million views, including datausa.io, dataviva.info, atlas.media.mit.edu, immersion.media.mit.edu, pantheon.media.mit.edu, streetscore.media.mit.edu, and others (see chidalgo.com for more details). 
At this point, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re wondering why Iâ€™m highlighting this guyâ€™s post two days before the Presidential election. Itâ€™s for two reasons. First, the piece offers a very good representation of the sort of peer pressure that can come down upon an academic for being seen as having the â€œwrongâ€ political opinion. Second, and perhaps most important, his email visualization tool taught him that the current state of our government in these United States simply canâ€™t achieve the best outcomes for the public at current scale (size, geographic/cultural diversity, etc). 
With all that out of the way, Iâ€™m going to highlight what I found to be the most powerful part of his piece. 
Enjoy: So what did we learn by making this dataset accessible? We learned a few things about what Clintonâ€™s emails said, about how the media works, and about how people interpreted the project. We made clinton.media.mit.edu publicly available last Friday night (October 28, 2016). We launched with a single story , written by Alejandra Vargas from Univision. My intuition was that the story was likely to get picked up by other news sources. After all, the tool facilitated peopleâ€™s ability to read and understand the content of these emails, and the connections of the people involved in them. But I was wrongâ€”it has been nearly a week since we released the project and no other major news source has picked up the story, despite having been viewed by more than 300,000 people in less than a week. So how did we get so much traffic without any news coverage? The answer is social media. So far, the tool has been shared widely on Twitter, Facebook, and for a brief but intense time, on Reddit. Its spread has been fueled by different motives, and also, has been battled in different ways. Many reporters shared the news on their personal accounts understanding that the tool represents a different form of data reporting, or data journalism: one where people are provided with a tool that facilitates their ability to explore a relevant dataset, instead of being provided with a story summarizing a reporterâ€™s description of that dataset. Another group of people that shared the news were interface designers, who understand that there is a need to improve the tabular interface of present day email clients, and that the inbox we presented in this project was an attractive new alternative. But many people also shared our site claiming that this was evidence of Clintonâ€™s corruption, and that the site supported Trump. More on that later. But the spread of the site was not without its detractors. A few hours after we released the site I received a message from a friend telling me that what I had done was â€œa huge mistakeâ€ and that I should have waited to post this until â€œlater in the year.â€ A few days later, outside my lab, a member of a neighboring research group called me a â€œTrump supporterâ€ and told me that I should have only made that site available if it also included Trumpâ€™s emails. I told him that I would be happy to include them, but I had no access to the data. In haste, this colleague began emailing me news articles, none of which provided access to the alleged public dataset of Trump emails. Later, a friend of one of my students posted the news on Reddit, where it went viral. And I mean really viral. It became the top story of the Internetisbeautiful subreddit, and made it to Redditâ€™s front page. It collected more than 3,000 upvotes and 700 comments. But as the story peaked, a moderator single-handedly removed it in an authoritarian move, and justified this unilateral silencing of the post by adding a rule banning â€œsites that serve a political agenda or that otherwise induce drama.â€ Of course, the rule was added AFTER the post was removed. Reddit appears to be rampant with censorship these days. So when it comes to media, social or not, I learned that providing information directly to people so that they can inspect it and evaluate it, is a value that many people consider second to supporting their preferred electoral choice. The twist is that I donâ€™t support Trump. In fact, I donâ€™t support him at all. I think he is potentially a threat to global security, and also, a candidate that has shown repeatedly to be a dividing rather than unifying force. He has failed to respect contracts numerous times, defrauding contractors; and he certainly has shown little respect for peopleâ€™s development by creating a fraudulent university. So I think he is ill prepared for most jobs, including a difficult one like that of being president. I support Clinton in this election, and even though I donâ€™t get to vote (As a green card holder I just pay taxes), I want her to win next Tuesday. I really do. But I understand that this is my own personal choice, a choice that I want to make sure is informed by my ability to evaluate information about the candidates directly, and by a media that is more transparent than the one we now have. Trust me, if I had Trumpâ€™s tax records, I would also think it is a good idea to make a tool that makes them more easily digestible. But my reason to make that tool, once again, would not come from my support for Clinton, or my opposition to Trump. It would come from my support for a society where people have direct access to relevant sources of information through well-designed data visualization tools. Now hereâ€™s where we get into very important lessons about the future. So what did I learn about Clintonâ€™s emails? One of the advantages of helping design a data visualization tool is that you get an intimate understanding of the data you are visualizing. After all, you have to explore the data and use the tool to make dozens of design decisions. In this case, the development cycle was particularly fast, but nevertheless I got to learn a few things about the data. Of course, the whole point of making this tool is that you can use it to come up with your own interpretation of the data. That said, you might be curious about mine, so Iâ€™ll share it with you too. What I saw on Clintonâ€™s emails was not surprising to me. It involved a relatively small group of people talking about what language to use when communicating with other people. Also, it involved many unresponded-to emails. Many conversations revolved around what words to use or avoid, and what topics to focus on, or how to avoid some topics, when speaking in public or in meetings. This is not surprising to me because Iâ€™ve met many politicians in my life, including a few presidents and dozens of ministers and governors, so I know that what work means to many people in this line of work, on a daily basis, is strategizing what to say and being careful about how to say it. I am sure that if we had access to Trumpâ€™s emails we would see plenty of the same behavior. So what I got from reading some of Clintonâ€™s email is another piece of evidence confirming my intuition that political systems scale poorly. The most influential actors on them are spending a substantial fraction of their mental capacity thinking about how to communicate, and do not have the bandwidth needed to deal with many incoming messages (the unresponded-to emails). This is not surprising considering the large number of people they interact with (although this dataset is rather small. I send 8k emails a year and receive 30k. In this dataset Clinton is sending only 2K emails a year). Our modern political world is one where a few need to interact with many, so they have no time for deep relationshipsâ€Šâ€”â€Šthey physically cannot. So what we are left is with a world of first impressions and public opinion, where the choice of words matters enormously, and becomes central to the job. Yet, the chronic lack of time that comes from having a system where few people govern many, and that leads people to strategize every word, is not Clintonâ€™s fault. It is just a bug that affects all modern political systems, which are ancient Greek democracies that were not designed to deal with hundreds of millions of people. On another note, this exercise also helped me reaffirm my belief that the best way to learn about the media is not by reading the news, but by being news. Iâ€™ve had the fortune, and misfortune, to have been news many times. This time, I honestly thought that we had a piece of content that some media channels would be interested in and that it would get picked up easily. I have many reporter friends who are enthusiastic about new forms of data journalism, and that actually have been positive and encouraging this week. So I imagined that there was a good chance that a reporter would see the site, go to his or her editor, and say: â€œHey, I have an interactive data visualization of all Clintonâ€™s emails. Can I write a story on it?â€ and the editor would say: â€œOf course, make it quick.â€ I donâ€™t know if these conversations actually happened, but given the large volume of traffic our project received I would be surprised if they didnâ€™t. I learned that the outcome was not the one I intuited. And this brings me to my final point, which is that while I support Clinton in this election, and I think Trump is a bad choice for president (a really bad one), I still think that we should work on the creation of tools that improve the ability of people to personalize scrutinize politically relevant information. I now understand that much of the U.S. media may not share that view with me, and that I think this is an important point of reflection. I hope the media takes some time to think about this on November 9 (or the week after). Also, the large number of people who were unable to interpret our tool as anything but an effort to support or oppose a political candidateâ€Šâ€”â€Šand that was true for both liberals and conservativesâ€Šâ€”â€Šspeaks to me about an ineffective public sphere. And thatâ€™s something I think we should all be concerned about. This polarization is not just a clichÃ©. It is a crippling societal condition that is expressed in the inability of people to see any merit, or any point, in opposing views. Thatâ€™s a dangerous, and chronic, institutional disease that is expressed also in the inability of people to criticize their own candidates, because they fear being confused with someone their peers will interpret as a supporter of the opposing candidate. If you cannot see any merit in the candidate you oppose, even in one or two of the many points that have been made, you may have it. So thatâ€™s how this election has muddled the gears of democracy. When we cannot learn from those we oppose, or agree when they have a valid point, our learning stops. We keep on talking past each other. I know that this election has made learning from those we oppose particularly difficult, but the difficult tests are the ones that truly show us what we are really made of. These are the situations that push us to see past   we donâ€™t like, or donâ€™t agree on, so we can rescue a lesson. You may not agree with me, but I hope at least I gave you something to think about. While his points about media censorship and peer pressure are self-explanatory, I want to take a quick moment to discuss his most meaningful insight, which is the idea that â€œ political systems scale poorly.â€ This is hugely important, because as the current status quo system collapses, many of us in the Western world will be presented with an incredible opportunity to do things completely different. Unfortunately, none of the candidates in the 2016 election (including Sanders and Trump) have been promoting the idea of political decentralization, which is the direction I think we need to move toward. In voting for Brexit, thatâ€™s exactly what the British people professed a preference for, and itâ€™s what we need here in America. In some important ways, I think we should look back toward the original concept of government as understood by our founders. A loose-knit collection of largely self-governing states that are bonded together in certain important ways, yet independent and sovereign in all other ways. Indeed, I think we can break things up even further than that, but letâ€™s start there for the time being. If we want to stick with representative democracy, I think for it to work best, it needs to be very local. I think the future of mankind depends on us getting our political systems right, and I think governance has to be shifted to the local level as much as possible. This all reminds me of Aldous Huxleyâ€™s extremely prescient warning in his 1958 book Brave New World revised (see my review of it), in which he wrote: Or take the right to vote. In principle, it is a great privilege. In practice, as recent history has repeatedly shown, the right to vote, by itself, is no guarantee of liberty. Therefore, if you wish to avoid dictatorship by referendum, break up modern societyâ€™s merely functional collectives into self-governing, voluntarily co-operating groups, capable of functioning outside the bureaucratic systems of Big Business and Big Government. Bottom line: We need to decentralize everything, especially government."
21053,"BookCourt, a Literary Cornerstone in Brooklyn, Is Closing - The New York Times",Eli Rosenberg,"Bookselling is a tough business these days, but BookCourt in Brooklyn seemed destined to stay. One of the foremost independent bookstores in the area for decades, BookCourt flourished, as did the borough, and it grew into one of the countryâ€™s premier literary hot spots. Its owners, Henry M. Zook and Mary B. Gannett, seemed to have found the secret to success after opening the store 35 years ago. But on Tuesday, Mr. Zook and Ms. Gannett said they planned to shut BookCourt on Dec. 31, sending a gasp through its literary community and its Cobble Hill neighborhood. BookCourt had weathered the upheaval of the bookselling industry over the last 20 years as reading habits changed and online outlets like Amazon rose. It withstood the 1999 opening of a Barnes  Noble store just a few blocks away and even outlasted the ownersâ€™ marriage. But the store could not survive one fundamental thing: the desire of both owners, now in their 60s, to retire. â€œWe know the store will be missed, and we are very proud of what we accomplished,â€ Mr. Zook and Ms. Gannett wrote in a statement. They said that the longevity could be explained in part because they had â€œinvested in the neighborhood and the real estate which housed the bookstore. â€ Over the years the couple bought the two stately buildings that house the store on bustling Court Street. Since its opening in 1981, BookCourt has hosted many famous authors who have stopped in the city for readings, lectures and talks, including Junot DÃ­az, Megan Abbott and Don DeLillo. And it has been a base for the writing community that has swelled in Brooklyn and a springboard for many   authors. The novelist Emma Straub said she did her first reading at BookCourt in 2009, around the time when she started working as a bookseller and sold copies of a   novella she wrote at the store. â€œLots of people I sold them to were editors that then bid on my novel later,â€ Ms. Straub, 36, said. Ms. Straub has had launch parties for all of her books here. â€œFor me, there was no place more important,â€ she said. Dennis Johnson, a founder of Melville House, a publishing company in Brooklyn, said he was shocked that the store was closing. â€œTheyâ€™re really supportive of little publishers like us,â€ he said. Mr. Johnson said that in the early 2000s, Mr. Zook would sell books at a few of his events. â€œHe said, â€˜Iâ€™ll bring a load down and sell them for you,â€™â€ Mr. Johnson said. â€œI doubt he made any money. â€ Mr. Zook and Ms. Gannett had opened the store long before the boroughâ€™s resurgence as a thriving cultural center and hip place to live. Zack Zook, 32, a son of BookCourtâ€™s owners, grew up in an apartment above the store. In the 1990s the block had overgrown vacant lots full of rusting automobiles. Rats abounded, he said, and some of the storeâ€™s workers had been mugged nearby. â€œIt was radically different than it is now,â€ he said. The vacant lots have been replaced by a Starbucks and a   grocery store. The novelist Jonathan Lethem said the store also influenced Brooklynâ€™s literary boom. â€œTo have a neighborhood bookstore like that was part of the formation of the character of the place as we now know it,â€ he said. Ms. Gannett and Mr. Zookâ€™s statement did not say why they decided to retire at the end of the year, but Zack Zook said his mother no longer lived upstairs and his father had moved upstate. â€œThey got in early. They were able to make sound investments,â€ Zack Zook said. â€œUsually when you make a significant investment, there is some kind of return. â€ On Tuesday, customers quietly perused the store. A woman with a dachshund on her lap read a childrenâ€™s book in the window. A clerk moved his arms like a windmill to a song on the stereo. One man conversed about the suburbs as a clerk dusted the store shelves. The air smelled of hardwood floor and the pages of books. â€œItâ€™s just the sort of amenity people move to Brooklyn for,â€ said Betsy Sand, who had been buying books at the store since it opened. She recalled that after Hurricane Sandy, â€œthis place was the neighborhood gathering place. â€ Nationally, statistics indicate that independent bookselling is on the rise. The American Booksellers Association, which represents independent booksellers, said its membership included more than 2, 300 stores in 2016, up from 1, 651 in 2009. And a couple of   stores have even expanded. Greenlight Bookstore in Fort Greene, which opened in 2009, added a shop in   Gardens last month. Word, in Greenpoint, opened an outpost in Jersey City. Ms. Straub and her husband plan to open a bookstore, a decision that came to them after learning BookCourt was closing. First, they asked Mr. Zook and Ms. Gannett to let them take over the store. â€œBut that didnâ€™t work out,â€ Ms. Straub said. Instead, they will try to open a store nearby. â€œWe decided that we couldnâ€™t stomach living in a neighborhood with no independent bookstore,â€ Ms. Straub said."
21054,Leaked Audio Of Hillary Clinton Proposing â€˜Rigging Electionâ€™,Eddy Lavine,"posted by Eddie Hillary Clinton proposed rigging a foreign election in a 2006 meeting with Jewish Press editors, and now the leaked audio has been posted on the web to prove it. Speaking to the editorial board of the Jewish Press at their office in Brooklyn, Clinton also said it was a mistake to allow Palestinians to hold a democratic election. â€œ I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake ,â€ said Senator Clinton. â€œ And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. â€ 
The audio tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Eli Chomsky, an editor and writer, his audio cassette is the only recording of the meeting. Nobody had heard it since 2006 â€“ until today when he released it to the world. However mainstream media have attempted to blacklist the story, and Control The Record employees have been actively working to remove it from internet forums and social media. The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, but Clintonâ€™s casually delivered comments about denying Palestinians democratic elections â€“ stating that if they must have them, they should be rigged â€“ has taken on new relevance in the midst of persistent allegations from Republicans that the Clinton camp is attempting to rig the Nov. 8 election. Fixing foreign elections Recalling the 2006 meeting, Chomsky says he was taken aback that â€œ anyone could support the ideaâ€”offered by a national political leader, no lessâ€”that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections .â€ Clinton also discussed the problem of global terror, and articulated phrases that Trump has accused her being reluctant to use publicly. â€œ I think you can make the case that whether you call it â€˜Islamic terrorismâ€™ or â€˜Islamo-fascism,â€™ whatever the label is weâ€™re going to give to this phenomenon, itâ€™s a threat. Itâ€™s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United Statesâ€¦Therefore we need a global response. Itâ€™s a global threat and it needs a global response. Chomsky is then heard asking Clinton a question about potential conflict in Syria â€“ and Clinton gives him an entirely different answer to the public position she is pushing now. In fact, she sounds just like Donald Trump does in 2016. â€œ Do you think itâ€™s worth talking to Syriaâ€”both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israelâ€™s point [of view]? â€ Clinton replied, â€œ You know, Iâ€™m pretty much of the mind that I donâ€™t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as youâ€™re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them.â€ The conversation moves on, but then Clinton returns to the topic. â€œ But if you say, â€˜theyâ€™re evil, weâ€™re good, [and] weâ€™re never dealing with them,â€™ I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat themâ€¦So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, Iâ€™ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. Thatâ€™s my take on it. â€ Chomsky said that he held onto the tapes for all of these years due the Jewish Pressâ€™s reluctance to â€œ say anything offensive about anybody, â€ but in the current election rigging climate he considered the contents of the tape to be in the national interest. â€œ I went to my bosses at the time, â€ Chomsky said. â€œ The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybodyâ€”even a direct quote from anyoneâ€”in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didnâ€™t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years .â€ source:"
21055,"Orlando Medical Examiner: â€˜Take a Typical Homicide Scene, Multiply It by 50â€™ - The New York Times",Frances Robles,"ORLANDO, Fla.  â€”   Corpses do not faze him but Joshua D. Stephany, Orlandoâ€™s chief medical examiner, still has the image of what he saw inside the Pulse nightclub on the morning of the slaughter seared into his head. Strobe lights were still flashing. The television was still on. Purses and cellphones were strewn about the floor. And there were bodies everywhere. â€œWhat you saw was drinks that were just served. You saw bills that were about to be paid. You saw   food,â€ said Dr. Stephany, 41, who was called into duty hours after Omar Mateen barged into the popular gay nightclub and opened fire.   people were killed in the attack. â€œTime just stopped. â€ Although he had been filling in for about a year, Dr. Stephany was officially made Orange Countyâ€™s chief medical examiner two days after the slaughter at Pulse. On his first real day on the job, his office completed 18 autopsies. He said he performed at least seven of the 49 autopsies. The exact number he is not certain of. He lost count. He and his four colleagues, aided by two state pathologists called in from elsewhere in Florida, have now conducted autopsies on all 49 victims as well as the assailant. Out of respect for those who were killed, Mr. Mateenâ€™s corpse is being held in a different part of the morgue, in an area typically used for decomposing bodies. Determining the cause of death was routine in this case, as all of the victims had bullet wound after bullet wound. â€œSo you kind of take a typical homicide scene, multiply it by 50, even that just wonâ€™t prepare you for what you see,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t think you can find anybody more experienced than medical examiners to go to that type of events, but to see the sheer number of decedent is almost surreal. â€ The pathologists put aside their emotions, he said, as they sought to identify everyone. The technicians photographed,   and fingerprinted the bodies to confirm their identities. They inspected tattoos. They washed blood off the victimsâ€™ faces so they could be compared to photographs from their driverâ€™s licenses and Facebook profiles. The identity of one victim frustrated the team for dozens of hours, until Dr. Stephany realized that a wallet he had picked up off the ground at the club as evidence contained the personâ€™s name. In autopsy after autopsy, the doctors documented every wound and plucked every bullet, noting where it entered and the direction it traveled. â€œIt doesnâ€™t appear anyone suffered,â€ he said. â€œEveryone went down where they were. I donâ€™t think anyone had prolonged suffering. â€ A New Hampshire native, Dr. Stephany has conducted several thousand autopsies in his life. He has seen his share of overdoses, suicides, hangings and car crashes. But he said he knows this case, his first as the chief, will be one he will not forget. â€œIt hasnâ€™t been able to sink in yet,â€ Dr. Stephany said. â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any way it could not affect you immediately or eventually. â€"

21058,US Supreme Court: Transgender Bathroom in Schools,nan,"US Supreme Court: Transgender Bathroom in Schools November 02, 2016 
For the first time the US Supreme Court will take up the issue of Transgender Bathrooms being forced on schoolchildren. 
The transgender bathroom and locker room issue has been debated in states across America since President Obama earlier this year publicly announced that Title IX anti-discrimination law includes transgender self-identity, he even weighed in specifically on the particular case in Virginia that has made it's way to the Supreme Court. Caitlyn Hope, a 17-year-old began to self-identify as a boy in 2014. She has not undergone sex change surgery but is undergoing hormone therapy. Caitlyn legally changed her name to Gavin and started to use the boys' showers, toilets, and locker rooms at school. 
""This is the first time that the Court will be addressing the question of whether laws protecting against sex discrimination in education are applicable to 'gender identity,'â€ Liberty Counsel noted. 
Parents voiced their concerns when hearing about what was happening at the school. Despite school board attempts to accommodate by building private, single-stall bathrooms and to keep school common bathrooms gender separate, they were sued. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought a lawsuit on Caitlyn's behalf, demanding that she may use all of the school's facilities. It is expected that the Supreme Court ruling next year will have direct impact on community bathroom laws, such as North Carolina's HB2, which keeps public bathrooms gender separate. 
There are currently only eight justices on the Supreme Court, and with Republicans disallowing hearings on Obamaâ€™s nominees, either pro-transgender Hillary Clinton or pro-life Donald Trump will nominate someone to fill the vacancy. On November 8th YOU will decide!

21060,"Police One: Conditioning Britons to â€™Run, Hide, Tellâ€™ Does Not Demonstrate Resolve",AWR Hawkins,"In the wake of the June 3 London Bridge attacks, Police One warns that conditioning Britons to â€œrun, hide, tellâ€ does not demonstrate resolve. [Instead they show that the tactic reveals â€œan aversion to the use of force in   [which] may embolden  â€¦     terrorists. â€  Police One praises the Brits who did what they could to buy time by throwing drink glasses, bar stools, etc. at the London attackers. The response was not without demonstrations of courage. But the overarching mindset of â€œrun, hide, tellâ€  instead of â€œMove! Escape or Attack!â€ betrays a conditioning that seeks a means of retreat instead of a means of counteraction it is a response from a position of weakness instead of a position of strength. Police One quotes Winston Churchillâ€™s 1940 address to the House of Commons: We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender. But the word â€œfightâ€ does not appear to be in the lexicon of those behind 21st century social and psychological conditioning in Britain.  And this is tragic because some people will be forced to fight for their lives. Police One explains, â€œYet, in the end, there may be no other alternative for the public but to fight. Running and hiding may work, depending on the circumstances and a personâ€™s proximity to the epicenter of an attack, but for some people, there will be no suitable alternative but fighting. â€ The lack of emphasis on â€œfightingâ€ is part of a paradigm that impacts the Metropolitan Police as well. After all, â€œthe majority of British police officers are not trusted with lethal force tools and the officers who are actually equipped with firearms operate in a culture where their use is highly discouraged by authorities. â€ So it comes as not surprise that one of the officers near the June 3 terror attacks had only a â€œclubâ€ for both an offensive and defensive tool. Police One asks, â€œIs it possible that the British are emboldening these attackers by failing to demonstrate their resolve and their commitment to confronting evil with force?â€ They suggest Churchill would answer in the affirmative.

21064,Failed weapons systems cost Pentagon $58 billion over two decades,RT,"Failed weapons systems cost Pentagon $58 billion over two decades Published time: 26 Oct, 2016 19:47 Get short URL The Pentagon building in Washington, DC. Â© AFP The Pentagon loves to throw good money after bad â€’ to the tune of nearly $60 billion on failed big-ticket weapons systems over the last two decades, according to a new internal Department of Defense review. 
From the Armyâ€™s Future Combat Systems (FCS) that focused on fighting the last war to its RAH-66 Comanche stealth helicopters that never quite got off the ground, between 1997 and October 2016, the Pentagon invested $58 billion on weapons technology it never received. That doesnâ€™t include the boondoggle that is the F-35 jet , which was finally declared â€œready for combatâ€ at the beginning of August. 
The FCS ($20 billion) and the Comanche ($9.8 billion) are just two of 23 major weapons programs that were canceled before they were finished, and together the two Army projects made up more than 50 percent of the â€œsunk costsâ€ outlined in the Pentagonâ€™s annual internal acquisitions performance review. The 224-page report by Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall was published earlier this week. Read more 5 costly Pentagon projects of dubious merit 
The report noted how much money was spent on each canceled program, how far along in the process they were before they were killed, and if any of the technology was rolled up into new programs. For example, although the FCS was canceled, parts of it â€’ including many of the manned ground vehicles and the Intelligent Munitions System â€’ were swept up into a current program called the Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Program. 
Most of the programs were killed before they blew through their budgets, but eight of them spent all the money allotted to them before the Pentagon canceled them, the report found. 
The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, conducted an audit of Pentagon spending in 2011 and found $70 billion in waste, the New York Times reported at the time . Much of the overspending happened because the DOD started building weapons systems before the designs were fully tested, the auditors said. 
With acquisitions overruns long being a thorn in the side of the Pentagonâ€™s budget, in March the Air Force enlisted IBMâ€™s Jeopardy! -winning cognitive computer , Watson. Two contractors are currently working to create programs that would enable Watson to navigate the 1,897-page Federal Acquisition Regulation, helping potential government vendors actually bid for military contracts. The project is expected to become operational by 2018. 
Another way the Pentagon has sought to cut down wasted spending is through the latest update to its acquisitions program, called â€˜Better Buying Power 3.0â€™, which was announced in April 2015 . The program was designed to have â€œa stronger emphasis on innovation, technical excellence, and the quality of our products,â€ Kendall wrote in a memo ordering the program's implementation. It calls on the military-industrial complex to make projects more affordable in terms of funding, schedule and manpower throughout the entire lifespan of their products. It will also reward contractors for successful expense management, and ask them to eliminate unproductive processes and unnecessary bureaucracy. 
Of course, holding contractors accountable for their failures when it comes to major cost overruns or weapons systems that donâ€™t work is easier said than done. And it doesnâ€™t help when someone at the Pentagon thinks itâ€™s a good idea to spend money on bomb-sniffing elephants ."

21066,New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain,Alex Ansary,"New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain 11/03/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Scientists may have made a significant breakthrough in restoring human sight, as a woman who had been blind for seven years has regained the ability to see shapes and colours with a bionic eye implant. 
The 30-year-old woman had a wireless visual stimulator chip inserted into her brain by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) surgeons in the first human test of the product. As a result, she could see colored flashes, lines, and spots when signals were sent to her brain from a computer. 
The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, suffered no significant adverse side effects in the process, according to a statement. 
The device, which was developed as part of the Orion 1 programme by Second Sight, uses technology to restore sight by bypassing the optic nerve to stimulate the brainâ€™s visual cortex, according to chairman Robert Greenberg. 
It is designed for those who cannot benefit from the Argus II retinal system that was unveiled at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital last year, but has limited application, as it depends on the patient having some retinal cells. 
This new system goes one step further by sending signals directly to the brain. It has the potential to restore sight to those who have gone completely blind for virtually any reason, including glaucoma, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, or trauma, according to the manufacturer. 
The next step is to connect the implant to a camera on a pair of glasses, and the company plans to seek FDA approval in 2017 to get the go ahead to conduct these trials. 
UCLA neurosurgeon Nader Pouratian, who implanted the stimulator, said the results of the surgery are promising. 
â€œBased on these results, stimulation of the visual cortex has the potential to restore useful vision to the blind, which is important for independence and improving quality of life,â€ he said."

21068,Judges Inventing New Reasons to Obstruct Donald Trumpâ€™s Popular Immigration Reforms - Breitbart,Neil Munro,"A federal judge in Hawaii says Muslims in America are unfairly and illegally discriminated against by Donald Trumpâ€™s effort to curb the immigration of violent Muslim refugees from   Muslim countries. [Another judge in Wisconsin says a Syrian who recently was given asylum  â€”   and who is not even a citizen  â€”   has the right to ask a fellow judge for visas to fly his relatives into the United States, regardless of opposition from the U. S. governmentâ€™s border, police and intelligence, and immigration agencies.   Three California judges and a judge in Washington State say the Presidentâ€™s sole right and solemn duty to guard the borders ends when a state suffers financial harm because its universities canâ€™t import more   customers from restricted countries. These   judges are competing with each other to throw invented legalistic roadblocks in front of Trumpâ€™s legal and proper defense of the nationâ€™s borders, said Hans Von Spakovsky, a former lawyer at the Department of Justice who is now working for the Heritage Foundation.  â€œI donâ€™t think the [various judges] have any professional shame about it  â€”   in fact, theyâ€™re being applauded by newspaper editors for actually ignoring the [Congressâ€™] law and [Supreme Court] rulings based on their own personal policy preferences,â€ he told Breitbart.  The judgesâ€™ grab for power, despite the plain text of the Congressâ€™ law and despite prior Supreme Court decisions, â€œis destructive of the rule of law, which is the entire basis of our Republic,â€ he said.  â€œIt is a very bad development that threatens our democracy   â€¦     [and] it looks like it is going to get worse [because] weâ€™re going to have more and more litigation, and it is very clear that the progressive left wants to use the courts to fight way our democracy works,â€ he said, adding â€œI think what they doing is very  . â€ The only fix, he said, is for Trump to aggressively push the Senate to confirm good judges for the 110 empty judicial seats around the nation. Trump will be aided in this push because the Senateâ€™s former Majority Leader, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, changed the Senate rules to lower the   thresholds to end filibusters of judicial confirmation debates. â€œThe Trump administration has to remember that Harry Reid ended the [ ] filibuster for judges except for the Supreme Court [so] all they need are 51 votes to get any judge confirmed   â€¦     They were given a gift by Harry Reid and they need to take it,â€ he said.  Trump must also disregard the Senateâ€™s traditional â€œblue slipâ€ process, which gives Senators a quiet veto over nominees to judicial seats in their states. Democrats used that process to push President George W. Bush to nominate progressive judges to   states during his eight years in the White House. One of Bushâ€™s â€œblue slipâ€ progressives judges blocked Trumpâ€™s Executive Order in Washington State by declaring that universities and companies can ask judges to override Presidentsâ€™ curbs on immigration. Trump and the GOP Senators â€œhave to override thatâ€   veto, Spakovsky said. The judge in Washington State, James Robart, declared Feb. 3 that â€œthe [presidentâ€™s] executive order adversely effects the Stateâ€™s residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel. These harms extend to the States by virtue of their roles as parens patriae of the residents living within their borders. â€ That judge was backed up by three judges in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who   court decisions from domestic cases to declare that the danger of jihadism is less urgent than universitiesâ€™ foreign revenues: the University of Washington was in the process of sponsoring three prospective employees from countries covered by the Executive Order for visas it had made plans for their arrival beginning in February 2017, but they have been unable to enter the United States. The University of Washington also sponsored two medicine and science interns who have been prevented by the Executive Order from coming to the University of Washington   â€¦     Under the â€œthird party standingâ€ doctrine, these injuries to the state universities give the States standing to assert the rights of the [foreign] students, scholars, and faculty affected by the Executive Order.   â€¦     the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination. We need not characterize the public interest more definitely than this when considered alongside the hardships discussed above, these competing public interests do not justify a stay [upholding Trumpâ€™s policy] The Wisconsin decision was announced March 10 by Judge William Conley of the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, who went several steps further by saying an individual, who is not even a citizen, has the right to overrule the president if he or she can get a judge to agree. According to the Wisconsin judgeâ€™s order:  Plaintiff is a Sunni Muslim who, after being fully vetted by U. S. immigration authorities, was granted asylum status because of the torture and religious persecution he had suffered in Syria. he thereafter filed derivative asylum petitions to reunite with his wife and his only surviving child  â€¦    .. President Trumpâ€™s efforts to impose an immigration ban by executive order are threatening to stop Plaintiffâ€™s derivative asylum petitions in their tracks. From 2o13 to 2015, government data shows that 25, 565 foreigners got asylum status  â€”   and according to Judge Conley  â€”   the right to bring their families into the United States regardless of Congresâ€™ laws and the policy that an elected president promised to implement if he was democratically voted into the White House.  In Hawaii, Judge Derrick Watson decided that the elected Presidentâ€™s policy of defending Americans from Muslim jihadis who emerged from Muslim culture in Muslim countries might hurt Hawaiiâ€™s tourism industry, saying in his order that: The State points to preliminary data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority, which suggests that during the interval of time that the first Executive Order was in place, the number of visitors to Hawaiâ€˜i from the Middle East dropped (data including visitors from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen)   â€¦     Because there is preliminary evidence that losses of current and future revenue are traceable to the Executive Order, this injury to the Stateâ€™s proprietary interest also appears sufficient to confer standing.  The judge also opposed the Presidentâ€™s national defense against Islamâ€™s violent doctrines by quoting the Muslim clericâ€™s testimony aboutâ€ethnicityâ€ and childrenâ€™s worries, saying:  [â€œMy children] are deeply affected by the knowledge that the United States â€”  their own country â€”  would discriminate against individuals who are of the same ethnicity as them, including members of their own family, and who hold the same religious beliefs. They do not fully understand why this is happening, but they feel hurt, confused, and sad. â€ Alongside the judgesâ€™ escalating and expanding claims of their judicial power over elected presidents, the written law is entirely clear that the written Constitution and the elected Congress give only the elected president and his   deputies the legal power to accept or deny entry of alien foreigners into the United States. Hereâ€™s the relevant statute, 8 U. S. C. Â§ 1182 (f): (f) Suspension of Entry or Imposition of Restrictions by President, Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The Supreme Court has accepted and validated this â€œplenary powerâ€ of the elected president. For example, the court declared in its 1950 judgment lawsuit, titled Knauff v. Shaughnessy, that â€œIt is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by [congressional] law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a given alien. â€ In 2015, the Court reasserted that judgment in Kerry v. Din, saying: The state action of which Din complains is the denial of [spouse] Berashkâ€™s visa application. Naturally, one would expect him â€”  not Din â€”  to bring this suit. But because Berashk is an unadmitted and nonresident alien, he has no right of entry into the United States, and no cause of action to press in furtherance of his claim for admission   â€¦     So, Din attempts to bring suit on his behalf, alleging that the Governmentâ€™s denial of her husbandâ€™s visa application violated her constitutional rights  â€¦     In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse. There is no such constitutional right. And, Here, a long practice of regulating spousal immigration precludes Dinâ€™s claim that the denial of Berashkâ€™s visa application has deprived her of a fundamental liberty interest. Although immigration was effectively unregulated prior to 1875, as soon as Congress began legislating in this area it enacted a complicated web of regulations that erected serious impediments to a personâ€™s ability to bring a spouse into the United States  â€¦     This Court has consistently recognized that these various distinctions are â€œpolicy questions entrusted exclusively to the political branches of our Government, and we have no judicial authority to substitute our political judgment for that of the Congress. â€ But that case was decided by 5 to 4, with former Justice Antonin Scalia providing the critical fifth vote against the block of four progressives who would have granted foreigners a conditional right to immigrate into the United States, regardless of government or voter preferences. Scalia is dead, and the Senate has yet to vote on his nominated successor, Judge Neil Gorsuch."
21069,Comment on West Point Academy And Children Are The New Champions For Gay Marriage by para para dinle,para para dinle,"West Point Academy And Children Are The New Champions For Gay Marriage By Jonathan Lenhardt on November 4, 2013 Subscribe 
Another day, another bit of ground my socially conservative Republican counterparts have lost on the gay marriage debate. This past Saturday, November 2, 2013 West Point Military Academyâ€™s Cadet Chapel hosted the first ever male same-sex marriage ceremony . This follows two female same-sex marriages late in 2012. 
Needless to say, somebody at the academy has decided to join the 21st Century and not a moment too soon; gay marriage was made legal in New York State way back in mid-2011 . Still, long time coming aside, it was a huge day for West Point graduates 28-year-old Larry Choate III (Class of 2009), and 27-year-old Daniel Lennox (Class of 2007), and we at Liberal America sent our congratulations. 
Sadly, however, there is still a raging debate on gay marriage and whether or not it should be made legal courtesy of the Big G, (U.S. Federal Government). Fifty two percent of Americans say yes according to a Gallup poll conducted this past July, and we already know what we, here at The Liberal Conservative , think about federal laws on not just gay marriage but marriage in general â€“ spoiler alert: weâ€™re for gay marriage, just not via federal law. 
Now the thing that the far-right, Tea Party-indoctrinated â€œRepublicans,â€ have to realize is that there is a certain group of people to which they have fallen behind on this matter, and many others. This is a group of people that they should be ashamed and embarrassed to have fallen behind. This is a group of people who have proven to be more mature, more merciful, kinder, and warmer than they are. 
Children . 
If youâ€™ve ever checked out any of the ?Kids React Toâ€¦? videos on YouTube such as the one above or this one or â€“ more importantly â€“ this one , then youâ€™re familiar with the work of The Fine Brothers , Benny and Rafi. Theyâ€™ve been at this for a while now and, as The Daily Dot explains, when theyâ€™re not getting kidsâ€™ reactions to things like, Nyan Cat, Justin Bieber, or Rebecca Black, they have their delightful cast of youngsters tackling issues like race relations, rape culture, bullying, and, yes, ?gay marriage. 
Thirteen children were asked to react to videos of same-sex marriage proposals and offer their opinion. With the exception of a single young boy, the children reacted universally positive; and then with anger when they inevitably discover that not everybody is allowed to marry who they love in the United States â€“ the â€œfreestâ€ nation on Earth. 
To the proposals themselves the kids, Californians aged 5 to 13 years, were floored by the displays of love they were fortunate to witness in the videos. And when he discovered the truth about gay marriage in America young Dylan wondered: 
Why would you be that mean to someone? 
Indeed. Why would we be that mean to someone? 
Someone in the audience yells â€œReligion!â€ and I roll my eyes in disappointed concurrence. 
This authorâ€™s personal favorite reaction comes from 5-year-old Lucas who, apart from looking gloriously like Zachary Quinto as Spock, turns to one of the Fines after the first video and asks â€œSo, theyâ€™re gay?â€ When this is confirmed he simply lets out a nonchalant and confirming, â€œOh.â€ Standing against gay marriage is..illogical."
21070,Megan Fox on â€˜Ninja Turtlesâ€™ and Female Stereotypes in Film - The New York Times,Melena Ryzik,"Fans of Megan Fox have had to exercise patience: The actress, by her own admission, doesnâ€™t work much. â€œIâ€™ve never made more than two movies a year,â€ she said. Her recent arc on the Fox series â€œNew Girl,â€ was, then, an unexpected treat, and she will reappear next season, she said, as a love interest and   comic foil. And she returns as April, the adventurous reporter and stalwart buddy in the sequel â€œTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,â€ out on Friday, June 3. A case of bronchitis caused her to miss the premiere in New York, where the movie was filmed, but Ms. Fox spoke afterward by phone from Los Angeles about her unambitious career path and her working relationship with the producer and director Michael Bay, who first propelled her to stardom in â€œTransformers,â€ and is behind the â€œTurtlesâ€ movies. As a mother of two young sons, with a third child on the way (with the actor Brian Austin Green) Ms. Fox, 30, long ago gave up playing Halo, but she still gravitates toward the fantasy universe. â€œIf I got sent 10 scripts and one of them was for an action or   or gaming movie, thatâ€™s the first one Iâ€™m gonna read,â€ she said. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Is it important for you to play women who are both strong and physically attractive? I donâ€™t get a whole lot of say in terms of character development on movies like these. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m in there helping them write the script saying, â€œApril should do this, because this is what a real feminist would do. â€ In terms of whatâ€™s available for women to play in general in Hollywood, itâ€™s pretty scarce. You have these stereotypes that still dominate films: the nag, the trophy, the escort. [Laughs.] I havenâ€™t been sent a nag script yet, but I do get plenty of, like, â€œinteresting stripper. â€ Or, â€œSheâ€™s super funny, but sheâ€™s also an escort, but thatâ€™s what makes it funny!â€ Would you rather have more say? [On â€œNinja Turtlesâ€] if I had said, I feel like my integrity is being compromised wearing this schoolgirl uniform, they would listen to that, of course. But that wasnâ€™t something that affected me in a negative way at all. On a movie like this, I donâ€™t mind doing [the scene] as written, but I do do a lot of improv. Iâ€™m sort of a   ballsy talker, and so I bring that to the character whenever itâ€™s appropriate to the scene. That never makes it in. How did the â€œNew Girlâ€ role come about? I donâ€™t watch a lot of television, so I didnâ€™t know about it. They wanted to pitch it to me, and I thought that was so bizarre, because Iâ€™m not known for working in television, and not known for comedy, even though Iâ€™ve done a couple. And I loved it. I was taken aback by how weird and offbeat and fun [the show] is, and the character falls right in line with how I like to play to my own comedic timing. Youâ€™ve said that youâ€™re not very ambitious as an actress. Why not? I know [that] idea is a very strange thing because usually actresses are all ambition, and are driven to achieve and theyâ€™re workaholics, for the most part. And Iâ€™ve never been that way. Iâ€™m not necessarily very passionate about acting per se. I donâ€™t feel validated by being on a set or making a movie. I have a lot of fun making these movies, but itâ€™s not a representation of my innermost being. You and Michael Bay had a public falling out after you compared him to Hitler in an interview. You werenâ€™t in the fourth â€œTransformers. â€ How did you mend fences? I had to ride out two years of very negative press. Thereâ€™s this perception that I was sort of thrown out of Hollywood. The positive thing was that it forced me to be very introspective and go, â€˜You were not totally right in this situation.â€™ I reached out to him, and we had a very genuine exchange. From that point forward, it was good. What kind of movies would you like to do? I actually prefer doing these kind of movies, which always surprises people because they always assume that everyone wants to be the suffering artist, making these festival pieces. Thereâ€™s something thatâ€™s more athletic about the process of making these movies, thereâ€™s more adrenaline involved, thereâ€™s more risk factor, thereâ€™s more chaos, and so I just find it to be a more exciting experience. These are also the kind of movies that I prefer to watch, because theyâ€™re an escape into a supernatural world, which has always been where I prefer to daydream, anyway."
21071,Chicago Tribune Editor Says Facebookâ€™s Anti-Fake News Algorithm is Killing Their Traffic - Breitbart,Allum Bokhari,"The deputy editor of the Chicago Tribune has accused Facebook of causing a decline in their web traffic, blaming the social networkâ€™s new algorithm, which is designed to surface â€œaccurateâ€ and â€œrelevantâ€ stories. [In a post on Medium, Tribune deputy editor Kurt Gessler revealed that the paper had seen a rapid decline in its median Facebook organic post reach after November, with the number of articles being read by fewer than 10, 000 readers â€œskyrocketing,â€ according to Gesslerâ€™s analysis of the data.   (Via Kurt  . com) Facebook did change its algorithms around the same time the Tribuneâ€™s median traffic began to drop. In January, Facebookâ€™s â€œtrending newsâ€ feature was changed from its previous model, which tailored results to the personal preferences and interests of users, to one which surfaced news based on geographical region. According to reports, the change was introduced to favor   â€œreal newsâ€ over â€œfake news. â€ The Chicago Tribune, of course, is one of the most influential and respected mainstream papers in the U. S. and clearly considered itself a part of the mainstream mediaâ€™s fight against â€œfake news,â€ which reached a height in the weeks and months immediately following Donald Trumpâ€™s election. â€œWe are going to point out fake news when we see it,â€ The Tribuneâ€™s Facebook account posted in late December. In January, Facebook also changed the algorithm of its usersâ€™ news feeds, again with a focus on finding â€œreal news. â€ According to Facebook, the new algorithm would â€œincorporat[e] new signals to better identify and rank authentic content. â€ The algorithm is also intended to surface â€œtimelyâ€ and â€œrelevantâ€ content. This is what Gissler  â€”   who does not believe a paper as mainstream and respectable and established as the Chicago Tribune could ever be accused of peddling fake news, much less admitting to it and correcting themselves afterwards  â€”   believes is hurting his paper. Given that I hope the Tribune passes muster for â€œauthentic,â€ letâ€™s focus on the second half. What exact signals are being used to determine what â€œtimelyâ€ means? It purports to favor topics that are being discussed in real time. In addition to rejecting the idea that the Chicago Tribune might not always publish authentic content, Gissler also fails to consider that the   of the paperâ€™s drop in traffic is also right after the general election. While some news sites have avoided a   slump, others, like Slate and Politico, saw traffic declines of 40 percent or more after the election. The legacy news industry is increasingly troubled by the power of Facebook and Google, which together are extending their dominant position in digital advertising. The British press industry publication Press Gazette recently launched a campaign against the   â€œduopolyâ€ of Google and Facebook, urging them to cut old media in on their ad revenue, as well as do more to tackle â€œfake news. â€ If Gisslerâ€™s suspicions are correct, however, tackling â€œfake newsâ€ might not get legacy media the results they wanted.

21072,Humans Came Out Of Australia Not Africa,Daily Bell Staff,"Humans Came Out Of Australia Not Africa By DailyBellStaff - November 05, 2016 
â€¦ Man searching for toilet in Australiaâ€™s outback makes astounding discovery of 49,000-year-old human settlement â€¦ Archaeologists working with traditional Aboriginal owners have discovered astounding evidence of the earliest human habitation of inland Australia. â€“ Sutff, NewZealandâ€™s Largest Online Source 
Australian habitation keeps getting pushed back and this discovery mentioned above pushes it back farther. 
But apparently not far enough. There are alternative explanations that claim Aborigines are somewhere in the area of 300,000 years old. 
This theory claims that Aborigine people colonized the world including Africa. 
The theory is supposedly based on inaccurate African DNA samples and more accurate Australian DNA samples 
You can see a comprehensive article here. There are a number of fascinating YouTube videos on the subject as well (if YouTub hasnâ€™t taken them down). 
The article refers to a paper, Recent African Genesis of Humans, by Professors Alan Wilson and Rebecca Cann. This paper was said to have established that humans came out of Africa. It was the â€œfinal word,â€ but then came this: 
Not long after their paper was published Rebecca Cann realised they were mistaken. In 1982 she examined the mitochondrial DNA of 112 Indigenous people, including twelve full-descent Aboriginals, and the results were in total opposition to what they assumed was fully resolved. 
Nevertheless, Cann was obliged to contradict a central tenet of their paper, stating that â€œmitochondrial DNA puts the origin of Homo sapiens much further back and indicates that the Australian Aboriginals arose 400,000 years ago from two distinct lineages, far earlier than any other racial type.â€ 
Not only was the emergence of Aboriginal Homo sapiens â€œfar earlierâ€ than any Africans, she provided a sequence and motherland. 
The Australian racial group has a much higher number of mutations than any other racial group, which suggests that the Australians split off from a common ancestor about 400,000 years ago. By the same theory, the Mongoloid originated about 100,000 years ago, and the Negroid and Caucasian groups about 40,000 years ago. 
Alan Wilson was â€œdesperateâ€ to reclaim validity for the paperâ€™s initial conclusions and visited Australia twice. He sampled â€œmtDNA of 21 full-descent Australian Aboriginals and provided 15 different strands.â€ The results led Wilson to decide that there must have been â€œ15 pregnant females on board.â€ 
He tried again in in 1989 but was no more successful. The second sampling included a â€œsimilar percentage (70%) of mutation was present.â€ Wilson quit at this point, conceding that humans had not come out of Africa initially. 
It seems too far out to admit, but while Homo erectus was muddling along in the rest of the world, a few erectus had got to Australia and did something dramatically different â€“ not even with stone tools â€“ but it is there that Homo sapiens have emerged and evolvedâ€¦ Homo sapiens would have evolved free from competition out of a small band of Homo erectus 400,000 years ago. 
There are at least ten Australian sites claimed to be older than 60,000 years, granted every date is challenged by conservative critics, but even so, all are the products of respected academics. 
What needs to be accepted is that if just one date proves to be correct, irrespective of whatever judgment is passed on the other nine, it can be confidently declared as a fact that Australia was not settled by African Homo sapiens 60,000 years ago. 
The Aborigine culture is based on so-called Dreamtime narratives that provide a history of Aborigine society. In fact, Egyptian inscriptions have been found in Australian caves. It is perfectly possible that Egyptian culture was in some sense initiated in Australia. 
The idea is that human culture generally is Australian. Illustrations of big, high-prowed boats have been found on rock walls in Australia. These are sea-going vessels. 
It is fairly clear that Aborigines reached South America perhaps 40,000 years ago and were subsequently attacked by waves of immigrant Indians. The Aborigines retreated to the bottom of South America, and islands there, where their descendants remain. 
Fascinating technology exists in Australia. Most significant are hand-sized â€œmelted rocksâ€ that also serve as star-maps. Even today we donâ€™t have the technology to melt successive layers of rock, one on-top of the other. 
And these melted rock maps have further elaborations. They seem to provide maps of the astrological heavens, hundreds or thousands of different constellations. 
The aborigine culture yields up numerous secrets. The tribes owned their land for tens of thousands of years and thus we can see that ownership of land is an organizing factor of mankind. They had confrontations but these were often individual in nature. The aborigine culture existed in Australia without major, ongoing wars, apparently. 
This is a larger lesson that indicates quite clearly that our current hyper-militarization is a kind of farcical propaganda. Human beings donâ€™t have to live in a perpetual state of war. 
The information about the Aborigine past is useful in other ways as well. It shows us more clearly than ever that there are two kinds of cultures in the world. 
There is tribal culture that organizes itself in harmony with â€œnatureâ€ and is both inclusive and democratic. Then there is â€œurbanâ€ culture that seeks to put people into huge metropolises where every facet of personâ€™s life can be controlled. 
Currently urban culture is ascendant. And the more one contemplates it, the more it seems purposeful rather than coincidental. 
Everywhere, tribal culture is under attack. In the Americas, tribal culture has been considerably diminished. Pacific cultures have lost tribal elements and these are only being gradually rediscovered. 
It turns out that there was a pan-Pacific culture that included canoe travel without maps. The navigator steered using perceptions of the waves and the sky. 
Often the navigator would supposedly go into a trance and stay in a semi-wakeful state for weeks at time. There was a whole culture associated with this sort of navigation and a pervasive education that could take decades to master. 
It had nothing to do with â€œdrifting raftsâ€ visiting other islands coincidentally. 
The aborigine culture has been virtually wiped out in Australia like other tribal cultures. But the more we understand about these cultures, the better. Unfortunately, there are considerable, organized barriers in the way. 
For instance, it is surely likely that organized human habitation took place more than 5,000 years ago. It is possible that coastal cities exited 10,000 years ago or longer. These cities were wiped out in a huge flood, or so the hypothesis goes. 
But there are evidences of this ancient culture including a city more than a mile offshore beyond Indiaâ€™s Western coast. The Indian government indicated it would investigate a decade ago but has not yet. 
The current archaeological bias involves a narrative of human civilization that begins with Sumer and ascends from there. But it is perfectly possible that the story of humanity is a good deal more complicated and includes ebbs and flows. 
The current archaeological bias militates against tribalism. We are supposed to believe that human society has ascended in perpetual progress. That makes anything that comes now better than what came before, which benefits elite strategies for continually organizing and manipulating humankind. 
Conclusion: Itâ€™s perfectly possible that human history is a good deal different than what weâ€™ve been told. One place to begin a reexamination is Australia."

21074,What Are Donald Trumpâ€™s Views on Climate Change? Some Clues Emerge - The New York Times,Erica Goode,"So far, Donald J. Trump has said very little about climate change and energy policy beyond his Twitter posts on the issues. He has called global warming a â€œhoax,â€ for example, and claimed that the Chinese fabricated climate change (just a joke, he later said). And in an interview this week with Reuters, he said that he was â€œnot a big fanâ€ of the Paris climate accord, and that â€œat a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements. â€ But more clues about Mr. Trumpâ€™s views on environmental issues emerged this week from a   briefing on energy policy prepared for the presumptive Republican nominee by Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota and an early supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Cramer, who defines himself as a climate change skeptic, discussed in his briefing paper a variety of government regulations that Mr. Trump might do away with if he were president. They included the Obama administrationâ€™s Clean Power Plan, currently pending in the courts, as well as a federal rule intended to protect waterways and wetlands, and a regulation setting standards for methane emissions that the Environmental Protection Agency completed last week. In an interview, Mr. Cramer said he wrote in the briefing paper that a growing number of Americans wanted action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. And he outlined a broad energy policy that embraced all types of fuel sources  â€”   including coal, oil, solar, wind and hydropower  â€”   that he called an â€œ      energy message. â€ Mr. Cramer, from a heavy   and   state, said it was important that any policy does not â€œpunish coalâ€ or other fossil fuels. Mr. Trump may soon share more of his views. His press secretary, Hope Hicks, said that the campaign â€œwill have more to say on the topic soon. â€ He is scheduled to speak at an oil conference in North Dakota on Thursday. Whenever Mr. Trump does fill in more details on the topic, he will have eager audiences both inside and outside his political party. Republican leaders worry that Mr. Trumpâ€™s views, his   Twitter messages notwithstanding, could end up somewhere left of the partyâ€™s mainstream. â€œI think there is concern about where he stands because he hasnâ€™t come out strongly one way or another,â€ said a Republican aide who insisted on anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Environmental groups, for their part, have seized on each new scrap of information to warn of disastrous consequences should Mr. Trump be elected. â€œTrump and Cramer are two peas in the climate denial pod, who would make reckless attacks on the progress we have made in the fight against climate change,â€ Seth Stein, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, said in response to news reports Thursday afternoon about Mr. Cramerâ€™s briefing paper. If Mr. Trump were to acknowledge the reality of climate change, that might provide some Republican politicians with political cover to do so as well. Since 2010, when a Republican member of Congress, Bob Inglis, lost his   bid after saying he would favor a carbon tax, many in the party have regarded any mention of climate change as the equivalent of political suicide. (Mr. Inglis has since focused on persuading conservatives to be â€œless averseâ€ to addressing climate change, and started a nonprofit group, the Enterprise and Energy Initiative, focusing on conservative responses to the problem.) Yet polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe that climate change is real and that the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program on Climate Change Communication, said that a nationally representative survey of 1, 004 registered voters, conducted in March in conjunction with George Mason University, found that 56 percent of Trump voters agreed that climate change was occurring. Just over half of them, however, thought those changes were caused by natural changes in the environment, rather than the result of   emissions. The number of Americans over all who say climate change is real has risen to 73 percent from 66 percent two years ago, according to the   Mason poll. But the jump among those who believe in global warming was steepest among Republicans, with a 16 percent increase in two years among all Republicans, and a 19 percent increase among conservative Republicans. Jay Faison, a North Carolina businessman who describes himself as a conservative Republican, said that denying climate change was â€œthe No. 1   issueâ€ that could pull voters away from supporting a candidate, according to research conducted by ClearPath, the organization he founded to promote clean energy and climate change policies that could appeal to conservatives. Mr. Faison, who has said he will devote $10 million to persuading Republican candidates to address climate change, said that a platform that emphasized clean energy solutions could make a difference of 1 or even 2 percent in close elections  â€”   â€œwhich decides a whole lot of elections. â€ Like many on both sides of the political aisle, Mr. Faison said he had no idea what Mr. Trumpâ€™s views on climate change might be. But he noted that the candidate once said in an interview that he believed in â€œimmaculate air. â€ â€œIf you believe in air pollution, then perhaps we could get to the same place,â€ Mr. Faison said. â€œIf we have cleaner energy solutions and it brings more energy independence, more jobs and lower air pollution, then we would do these things even if we donâ€™t agree with scientists on climate change. â€ It is a view that echoes those expressed by Mr. Cramer, who in the past has said he would support a small carbon tax if the revenue went to research on clean fuel technologies. â€œThere is no downside in reducing emissions from fuel,â€ said Mr. Cramer, who added that â€œthe climate is clearly changing,â€ but that he was skeptical about how much humans were contributing to the change and about the regulatory solutions offered by Democrats. Climate change has long been far down on the list of issues that voters say are important to them. (Developing clean energy was ranked No. 21 of 23 issues by Trump supporters in the   Mason survey). But Jerry Taylor, the president of the Niskanen Center in Washington, a libertarian think tank, said that the importance of issues in votersâ€™ minds might change during an electoral campaign if a candidate talked about them repeatedly. Mr. Taylor said that if Mr. Trump continued to deny the existence of climate change, Hillary Clinton could use that to claim that Republicans were   and out of touch with reality. â€œClimate contributes significantly to the poor branding of the Republican Party,â€ he said, adding that just because an issue was a low priority to voters â€œdoesnâ€™t mean it canâ€™t be used to devastating effect against you. â€"
21075,"Yellow Cab, Long a Fixture of City Life, Is for Many a Thing of the Past - The New York Times",Winnie Hu,"John McFadden no longer sticks his hand out for a yellow cab. He has plenty of other options at his fingertips. With a couple of taps on his phone, he lines up rides with Via, a   service that shuttles him around Manhattan with strangers for a flat rate of $5. When he wants to ride alone, he taps again, this time summoning a car through Uber. â€œI used to go out and hail a cab, but this is more convenient,â€ said Mr. McFadden, 47, a photographer. â€œWe all use our phones all day, every day. â€ The yellow cab may be as synonymous with New York as pizza, Broadway and the Empire State Building, but more and more it is no longer the ride of choice. This fixture of city life  â€”   a touchstone of popular culture in movies like â€œTaxi Driverâ€™â€™ and the hit television series â€œTaxiâ€  â€”   was once the main alternative to subways and buses, hailed by rich and poor alike. Cabdrivers were the ambassadors of the streets, welcoming newcomers, passing along city lore and dispensing advice even when no one asked. But yellow cabs  â€”   which now number just 13, 587  â€”   have lost significant ground to a growing fleet of black cars summoned by   apps with short, catchy names and loyal followings: Uber, Lyft, Via, Juno, Gett. The average number of daily taxi trips fell by more than 100, 000 in November 2016 from the same month six years ago as these apps have taken off. Today, more than 60, 000 black cars are for hire in the city. More than 46, 000 are connected with Uber, though they may also work for other services too. And the competition is fierce. The     services offer discounts and promotions along with options such as car pools, the ability to rate drivers and GPS tracking. They have flooded neighborhoods where taxi service has long been spotty and are now competing in areas like Midtown Manhattan, where taxis once flourished. And they appeal to a new generation of   riders who live on their phones, ordering everything from groceries to books and movies. â€œIt wonâ€™t be long before this is an Uber town instead of a   town,â€™â€™ said Evan Rawley, an associate professor of management at the Columbia Business School. â€œ  apps have gained a huge market share in a short period of time. They have expanded the market, but also stolen share from taxicabs. â€™â€™ Many   owners and drivers are struggling in a city with more transportation options than ever, including a new subway line on Second Avenue and the proliferation of Citi Bikes. The medallions that give cabs the right to operate have plummeted in value, going for less than half of the $1. 3 million price recorded in 2013 and 2014, though industry experts have cautioned that their value was inflated. At the same time, many drivers have defected to the new services, which often offer more flexible hours and bonuses, resulting in so many taxis sitting idle in parking lots and garages that they have become known as â€œtaxi graveyards. â€ Over all, yellow cabs made an average of 336, 737 daily trips and $4. 98 million in fares in November, down from 463, 701 trips and $5. 17 million in fares in the same month in 2010, according to city data. â€œI donâ€™t remember the last time I took a yellow cab,â€ said Stacey Moorehead, 51, who works in advertising. â€œMy son had a bar mitzvah every single weekend for six months. I never took a cab. I either took Via or Uber to take him there and to pick him up. â€ Kwabena Boateng, 46, a cabdriver since 2001, says that things have gotten so bad that many of his friends now work for Uber. He makes less than he did even three years ago. â€œI am still contemplating what to do,â€ he said. Still, Michael Woloz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the owners of 5, 500 medallions, said the   industry was evolving to meet the demands of passengers and drivers, introducing its own apps, Arro and Curb, and opening a new center in Queens to provide training and recruit new drivers. â€œThis is always going to be an iconic   town,â€ Mr. Woloz said. â€œUber is the same everywhere  â€”   there is nothing â€˜New Yorkâ€™ about them  â€”   kind of like McDonaldâ€™s or Starbucks. But yellow taxis are unique to New York City and, while maybe a little retro, they are as vital and soulful as ever. â€ New York Cityâ€™s taxi industry grew out of the   hansom cabs of the 1800s, according to Graham Hodges, the author of â€œTaxi! A Social History of the New York City Cabdriver. â€ After a businessman, Harry N. Allen, was overcharged for a ride, he started the first fleet of   cabs in 1907. The shiny red cars were imported from France, equipped with fare meters and lined up at a stand outside the Plaza Hotel. As the years went on, yellow taxis became popular because the color was easy to spot from a distance, Mr. Hodges said. John Hertz, the founder of Hertz car rental company, started the Yellow Cab Company in Chicago in 1915. Yellow became the official color of New Yorkâ€™s medallion taxis in 1967. There were more than 16, 000 cabs in New York before the city began regulating the number in 1937 out of concerns that an oversupply had led to reckless driving, congestion and   fares. â€œIt became part of our consciousness,â€ Mr. Hodges said. â€œTheyâ€™re really essential to the quotidian life of the city. â€ Yellow cabs still have their fans. Sean Lawrence, 28, a freelance producer, said he preferred hailing a cab because it was less complicated than fiddling with an app and because cabdrivers knew their way around. â€œI like to think the hail is here to stay,â€ he said. But others have never even set foot in a yellow cab. Since moving to the city in June, Chip Hermann, 25, an associate at a financial services company, has used only Uber, Lyft, Via or Juno. â€œMaybe Iâ€™ve missed that â€˜New York experience,â€™ but I donâ€™t really want it,â€ he said. â€œIt just makes sense to use technology to make things cheaper and easier. â€ Uber, which started operating in New York in 2011, is by far the largest of the   services. It provided an average of 226, 046 rides per day in October 2016, followed by Lyft, with 35, 908 rides, according to city data. Via had 21, 698 rides Juno, 20, 426 and Gett, 7, 227. â€œBefore you used to see a sea of yellow now you see a sea of black,â€ said Robert Perez, 63, a cabdriver for two decades, as he pointed to a line of black cars on West 38th Street. While black cars have long served Wall Street banks and law firms, they were not for casual or   users because they had to be prearranged. Only taxis were allowed to pick up people on the street. But now, with smartphone apps that can dispatch cars in minutes, there is little practical distinction between them. But   owners and drivers complain that while they serve the same customers as the   apps, they are more heavily regulated by the city. Uber, for instance, can use surge pricing to charge higher fares during peak times while cabs are locked into fixed rates. By 2020, half of all yellow cabs must be   while the new services have no such mandate. â€œSome progress has been made in leveling the playing field, but a lot more work needs to be done,â€ Mr. Woloz said. Meera Joshi, commissioner of the Taxi  Limousine Commission, said regulation was needed â€œto protect the rights of passengers, drivers and those they share the street with. â€ Alix Anfang, an Uber spokeswoman, said the company filled a gap, serving many neighborhoods where yellow taxis were scarce and other transportation options limited. â€œWe have consistently grown fastest in communities outside of Manhattan,â€™â€™ she said, â€œbecause there is a huge market of people who want a reliable, affordable way to get around but, before Uber, were left stranded. â€ Via started in 2013 with five sport utility vehicles on the Upper East Side, where subways are crowded even with the new line on Second Avenue and taxis are in short supply during commuting periods. The service now has more than 1, 500 cars crisscrossing much of Manhattan, as well as making stops in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and at the airports. Via has also expanded to Chicago and Washington. Uber and Lyft have their own version of a city car pool, UberPool and Lyft Line. Daniel Ramot, 41, Viaâ€™s   and chief executive, said his service was inspired by the shared taxis in Israel known as â€œsherutâ€ that supplement the public transit system. Mr. Ramot said he could have used Via himself when he worked for a biotechnology research company in Midtown in 2012. At the end of a long day, he would join the line of people at the curb, all trying to hail cabs. â€œIt was not a happy moment, especially if youâ€™re trying to get home and do something,â€ he said. â€œI could just visualize these vans coming up the avenues picking people up and dropping them off. â€"
21076,Marine Le Pen Sharpens Attack on Emmanuel Macron in French Debate - The New York Times,Adam Nossiter,"PARIS  â€”   The French   leader Marine Le Pen clashed sharply with her probable presidential opponent, the centrist Emmanuel Macron, over immigration, integration and Franceâ€™s role in the world, during a marathon televised debate Monday night, a vivid prelude to the election battle to come. Facing off for the first time in a   debate that stretched for three and a half hours, Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Macron offered the starkest of contrasts, with the National Front leader providing a dark picture of a France besieged by immigrants and Islam, and her rival preaching conciliation. The debate also included the three other main contenders  â€”   the Socialist BenoÃ®t Hamon, the Republicansâ€™ FranÃ§ois Fillon, and the   candidate   MÃ©lenchon  â€”   but it was the fight between Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen that riveted attention. Mr. Macron, a former economy minister who founded a  political movement centered on   Franceâ€™s stagnant economy, but who has never held an elected office, appeared flustered at times as Ms. Le Pen displayed a mocking smile. The first round of voting in the presidential election will be on April 23, and the top two candidates will advance to the second round on May 7. Opinion polls show that Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen are the most likely to make it to that runoff  â€”   a result that would be a stunning rebuke for Franceâ€™s two main political parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. Ms. Le Pen, inheritor of the   populist National Front party from her father, concentrated her fire Monday night on her younger opponent. Mr. Macron, 39, has advanced more by offering a fresh face than by political savvy, and Ms. Le Pen, 48, sought to exploit his vulnerability, forcing him to define himself in opposition to her strident positions. She accused Mr. Macron of supporting the â€œburkini,â€ the   swimsuit at the center of a rancorous debate last summer over displays of the Muslim faith. â€œWeâ€™ve got Islamists in our country,â€ Ms. Le Pen said. â€œThe demands are incessant,â€ she said, citing food and clothing. An unsettled Mr. Macron shot back: â€œIâ€™m not putting words in your mouth. I donâ€™t need a ventriloquist. â€ â€œThe trap you are falling into, Madame Le Pen, with your provocations, is to divide society,â€ he said, adding that she was making â€œenemies out of more than four million French men and women whose religion happens to be Islam. â€ The other three candidates present Monday night tried to get shots in at the two  . Mr. Fillon was once favored to win the election, but he has been wounded by a series of scandals, most notably charges of embezzlement over allegations that he put family members on the government payroll for nonexistent jobs. He sought during the debate to project a reassuring image of gravity, but he was forced to acknowledge that he â€œmight have made some mistakes. â€ Most recently, he was accused of accepting two suits worth 13, 000 euros, or about $14, 000, from a political fixer. That has left Mr. Fillon vulnerable to sly insinuations about his ethics.

21077,Mar-a-Lago Neighbors Discover Costs of Trumpâ€™s Visits - The New York Times,Jane Smith and Frances Robles,"PALM BEACH, Fla.  â€”   For some of the businesses and government agencies that surround President Trumpâ€™s â€œWinter White House,â€ the effects of his frequent weekend getaways to    can best be told in numbers. â–  $200, 000 in lost fuel sales at a large local airport in a single   visit this month. â–  75   at a new restaurant in just one night. â–  $60, 000 a day to pay overtime to sheriffâ€™s deputies who guard the many closed roads, a tab that is about $1. 5 million over all since the election. â–  250 private flights grounded every day. A month into his presidency, Mr. Trump arrived at    his private club here, for a third weekend in a row this Presidentsâ€™ Day weekend. For the locals, thatâ€™s at least three days of clogged roads and strict security protocols that hurt local businesses and frustrate residents. Although economic development officials are ecstatic over the free publicity provided by news reportersâ€™ live waterfront shots  â€”   and the excited buzz in the area is palpable  â€”   others are exasperated over the drain on small businesses and the circuitous routes residents have to drive to avoid two miles of closed roads. Secret Service rules restricting private flights have grounded operations at  Palm Beach County Park Airport in Lantana, nine miles south of Mr. Trumpâ€™s club, where most of the business is conducted on Saturday and Sunday. That means no parachute jumping, banner advertising, flight lessons or chopper trips. Business owners there are hoping that a president who campaigned on improving the economic prospects of the little guy will be sympathetic to the havoc his visits wreak. â€œThis is a good test of his words versus his actions,â€ said Jonathan Miller, whose company, Stellar Aviation Group, runs the airport. He said he had lost $30, 000 with each of the presidentâ€™s visits. Dave Johnson, the owner of Palm Beach Aircraft Services, which maintains and operates planes at Lantana, said he employs eight people full time and provides transportation for clients including doctors, lawyers and other professionals who travel throughout the country for work. But when Mr. Trump is in town, no private flights can take off within a   radius, and arriving flights have to first stop elsewhere for security clearance. â€œWe never dreamed that heâ€™d be here every weekend  â€”   thatâ€™s the killer,â€ Mr. Johnson said. â€œIâ€™m getting customers that have been with me for years, and theyâ€™re actually moving their aircraft to other airports so they can fly. â€ The Palm Beach County airport directorâ€™s office tallied the losses during Mr. Trumpâ€™s visit Feb. 3 to 6 to   . A sightseeing business canceled 19 tours and turned away a dozen  . One flight school business had to scratch $14, 000 worth of flight lessons. One company is in negotiations to move its   fleet out of the county, which would mean a loss of a quarter of the airportâ€™s fuel sales, according to the officeâ€™s analysis. â€œItâ€™s a very busy airport with a lot of   men trying to make a living,â€ said Bruce Pelly, the airport director for Palm Beach County. â€œYou got flight training, aeronautics, a propeller shop, paint shops, maintenance companies. You got all kinds of businesses going on down there. We are obviously trying whatever we can to get that airport functioning in some form or fashion. â€ Mr. Pelly said he had â€œoffered everything we can think ofâ€ to make the airport secure. The Secret Serviceâ€™s response so far: â€œNo. â€ The White House and the Federal Aviation Administration referred calls about the matter to the Secret Service. The Secret Service did not respond to requests for comment. â€œIn their view, that airport is too close to  â€ Mr. Pelly said of his conversations with the Secret Service. â€œWe are not giving up. â€ Jorge Gonzalez, who owns SkyWords Advertising, said he might have to. He said his business had lost $42, 000 because of Mr. Trumpâ€™s visits, during which his   planes were grounded. He hopes to last through May, but his wife said that at this rate, 30 days was more likely. â€œWe are hoping his visits slow to once a month,â€ Mr. Gonzalez said. This isnâ€™t the first time a presidentâ€™s travels have caused local disruptions. President Barack Obamaâ€™s visits to Hawaii were a source of frustration for pilots and aviation businesses there that had to abide by similar restrictions. And President Bill Clintonâ€™s frequent visits to White Plains during his presidency brought additional chaos to an already busy Westchester County Airport. Sascha Bennemann opened Costa Palm Beach, a Mediterranean restaurant at the Esplanade shopping complex at the east end of the countyâ€™s toniest shopping district, Worth Avenue, just as Mr. Trump began his regular trips. On the second Saturday in February, when a   stretch of South Ocean Boulevard that runs in front of    was closed, cutting the town in two, 70 people did not show up for dinner, amounting to a loss of about $5, 000, Mr. Bennemann said. He showed a photo of himself golfing with Mr. Trump last year, to underscore: â€œItâ€™s nothing personal. â€ Mr. Bennemann noted that increased foot traffic had offset some of his losses, and other Worth Avenue shop owners also said the visits had brought an increase in pedestrians. â€œFor us, we have had some of the best days ever on weekends,â€ said Tatiana Van Zandt, who owns Trillion, a luxury clothing store. â€œThe hum is exciting. â€ Kelly Smallridge, the president and chief executive of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, said her agency would never have been able to afford the countless hours of free publicity. â€œCertainly this is the greatest advertising campaign in terms of name recognition an economic development board can hope for,â€ Ms. Smallridge said. Although Palm Beach had already been viewed as a place to vacation or retire, Mr. Trumpâ€™s visits have brought â€œpanache and glamour,â€ which have caught the attention of a wider spectrum of people, including hedge fund and money managers, she said. Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said, â€œIf we want to be the Pollyanna of Palm Beach, all of the focus on the town is wonderful. â€ Residents on that   stretch of closed road have to carry ID cards to get back to their homes, even when out walking their dogs.    Club members must park their cars at a parking lot down the street to be screened before they can enter through the clubâ€™s south entrance. The road closing splits the island in half, forcing residents to drive off the island into neighboring West Palm Beach if they want to shop or eat on the other half. The road was closed again at 8 a. m. Friday and was expected to remain closed till late Monday evening. â€œNo one is for road closures itâ€™s an inconvenience,â€ said Kirk Blouin, the townâ€™s public safety director. â€œBut most recognize itâ€™s a necessity for the security of the president. â€ St. Catherine Greek Orthodox Church, in West Palm Beach at the western end of the Southern Boulevard Bridge, was holding its 42nd annual Greek Festival this weekend. â€œIf they see the road closed, they will find something else to do,â€ said the Rev. Andrew Maginas, who said the festival was a critical  . â€œWe pray for him at every service to do right by our country, but we are sad that his visit comes during our festival. â€œWe are hoping he can build a helipad soon on    grounds. â€"
21078,Salesforce Rules Out a Bid for Twitter - The New York Times,Michael J. de la Merced and Quentin Hardy,"SAN FRANCISCO  â€”   Twitter may have to fix its problems on its own, at least for now. Salesforce. com, the enterprise software maker that had been the most likely bidder for the embattled social media company, has declined to pursue a takeover. â€œIn this case weâ€™ve walked away,â€ Marc Benioff, Salesforceâ€™s chief executive, told The Financial Times in an interview published on Friday. As Salesforce exits, virtually no other suitors seem likely to emerge. Rumors of potential other bidders  â€”   Google, Disney and Apple were among the names floated  â€”   quickly evaporated. That leaves Twitter largely on its own, at least in the near term. And the move will please Salesforce investors, many of whom detested the idea of a pricey and distracting bid for the social network. Shares of Twitter, which had stabilized on the hopes that Salesforce might still make a bid, dropped about 5 percent in afternoon trading on Friday, to $16. 88. And shares of Salesforce rose about 5 percent, to $74. 27. Mr. Benioff confirmed his remarks but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Twitter, Kristin Binns, declined to comment. The interview all but confirms that Twitter will need to pursue a   plan rather than looking to a new owner that could shield it from the skepticism of stock market investors. Despite its prominence as a forum for public discussion  â€”   especially during the presidential race  â€”   Twitter has still lost ground to competitors old and new. Some Twitter users have been leaving the service, and the company has found it difficult to persuade people to join. Its advertising revenue growth is also on a path toward slowing down. Twitter has been emphasizing its mission around live events and   commentary, stressing initiatives based on   video, like its broadcasts of some N. F. L. games. Twitter executives and the board have tried to buy more time to show that they can refocus the company on those live events and increase its appeal. During the weeks when rumors of a Twitter deal reached fever pitch, speculation swirled around potential divides within the companyâ€™s board. Among those who opposed a sale, at least at first, was Jack Dorsey, its   and chief executive. More recently, Mr. Dorsey had become increasingly open to selling the company. Without a deal, Mr. Dorsey and his team are more likely to face tough questions when earnings are reported on Oct. 27. Twitter executives have considered selling some units or laying off employees, as The New York Times reported last month. It could sell Vine, the mobile   service, or MoPub, a mobile advertising business. The investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen  Company are advising it on its options. â€œThere is declining advertising interest in Twitter,â€ said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. â€œWhen you overlay that with the companyâ€™s current fundamentals, youâ€™ll see very little top line revenue growth next year. â€ At the same time, companies mooted as potential buyers had decided that Twitter at its current valuation  â€”   its market capitalization has surpassed $13 billion at certain points  â€”   was too expensive and required too much work to fix. Salesforceâ€™s investors are probably feeling some relief. For much of its   existence, Salesforce has relied on acquisitions to grow, augmenting its core   management offerings. But 2016 has proved a particularly active time for   at the company. Salesforce has bought 13 companies for more than $4. 4 billion. Shareholders were upset that in August, Mr. Benioff agreed to pay $582 million for a company called Quip, a maker of   collaboration software that had negligible revenue. But Mr. Benioff said he needed its founders to rebuild his corporate architecture for the next new things in corporate software. A bid for Twitter  â€”   a   company with significant challenges  â€”   represented to many investors an act of overweening ambition. At a $12 billion market cap, Twitter would have been the largest deal yet for Salesforce, which is worth $50 billion. It was Salesforceâ€™s initial takeover approach that set off the flurry of speculation about a takeover, and as recently as early as this month, Mr. Benioff telegraphed his interest in buying what he called â€œan unpolished jewel. â€ In an interview during his annual customer conference this month, he said he was attracted to Twitter as a way for companies to field customer complaints and promote themselves, and pursued the deal in part to learn more about the current tech market. Some of that may have been bluster. Mr. Benioff has often treated his company a bit like a   both in his generous stock grants to employees and his    . Yet many large Salesforce shareholders, including the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, sent emails and other messages to Salesforce executives voicing their displeasure. The prospect of a shareholder revolt could have proved disastrous for the company, which relies heavily on its stock for its   and to pay its employees. A sustained drop in Salesforceâ€™s stock price would harm both activities. In a meeting with analysts last week, Mr. Benioff sounded unusually contrite and somewhat shocked that his impetuous style had riled his biggest shareholders. â€œWe will think through everything, but we would never do a deal that would ever do the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails,â€ Mr. Benioff said at that meeting. By Friday, Mr. Benioff conceded that Twitter was a deal he could afford to pass up. â€œItâ€™s not the right fit for us for many different reasons,â€ he said in the Financial Times interview."
21079,Five Reasons Why Belief in Authority is the Most Dangerous Superstition,stevew,"5 Reasons Why Belief in Authority is the Most Dangerous Superstition Belief in authority is dangerous, and doubly so when the majority is under its spell. 
â€œQuestion authority, including the authority that told you to question authority.â€ â€” Sixth grade girl 
Letâ€™s get something straight, here at the outset. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with authority itself. Itâ€™s the belief part that messes everything up. Anyone can claim authority. But such authority only matters if others believe in it. 
I can claim that Iâ€™m an authority on unicorns, but I better have the credentials to prove it. And it would also help if unicorns existed. But the point is this: If enough people â€œbelieveâ€ that Iâ€™m an authority on unicorns, and they â€œbelieveâ€ that I have dissected a unicorn and revealed the magical quality of its insides that causes it to shit rainbows, then Iâ€™ll not only have violated truth, Iâ€™ll have violated the minds of others and taken advantage of their ignorance. But, and hereâ€™s the rub, itâ€™s their fault for not questioning my so-called authority. As Albert Einstein said (himself an authority in the field of physics), â€œUnthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.â€ So if weâ€™re correct to question Einsteinâ€™s revolutionary theories, then weâ€™re exponentially correct to question my unicorn theories. 
Respecting a prestigious authority, or taking into consideration important knowledge gleaned by someone who is an authority in a particular domain of knowledge is fine. Itâ€™s even okay that sometimes we allow people to violate our minds. We allow artists to do it all the time. No, itâ€™s when we â€œbelieveâ€ in authority, when we blindly follow a perceived authority, that things go wrong. 
Belief implies non-questioning. But letâ€™s sail right past semantics and art and get down to brass tacks. Belief in authority is dangerous. And itâ€™s doubly dangerous when the majority of people are under its spell. Here are five reasons why. 1.) It Can Cause Otherwise Good People to do Evil Things 
â€œItâ€™s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.â€ 
MARK TWAIN 
So back to my authority on unicorns. Did you know that unicorns also created the universe? Yup! Not only do they shit rainbows, they also puke universes. The last unicorn died for our sins in a forest of fiery crosses. And the only commandment that survived the test of time is this: â€œAnyone who questions the fact that unicorns created the universe are godless heathens and deserve to die and spend eternity in the fiery pits of a Tennessee summer afternoon.â€ 
Now enter unquestioning idiots with hooked-on-authority soup for brains. They â€œbelieveâ€ the Last Commandment of the Unicorns. They believe it so much that they refuse to question it, lest other believers think they are not true believers. Lest they get ostracized by the status quo. Lest they look â€œcrazyâ€ in the eyes of their fellow believers. Now just replace The Last Commandment of the Unicorns with the Bible or the Koran or the Constitution of the United States, or state-driven police enforcement , or the belief that â€œnothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.â€ 
The problem is that people will fight, and kill, and murder, and commit both genocide and ecocide, for what they believe in. But they might not have fought so violently and thoughtlessly had they simply taken into consideration ALL those claims of authority and moved on smartly with their lives. The best way to maintain a healthy skepticism, and not devolve into an ignorant, sycophantic, violent mess, is to take things into consideration and question them rather than believe in them. 2.) It Leads to the Idea That We Need to Give a Group of People Permission to Control Us 
â€œThe multitudes have a tendency to accept whoever is master. Their very mass weighs them down with apathy. A mob easily adds up to obedience. You have to stir them up, push them, treat the men rough using the very advantage of their deliverance, hurt their eyes with the truth, throw light at them in terrible handfuls.â€ 
VICTOR HUGO 
By the way, the Church of the Last Unicorn is in charge of everything. It is the power behind all nation states. It pulls the strings of presidents. It whispers dark secret nothings into the ears of queens. It tugs the coattails of emperors. Its poison-soft invisible rainbow-powers saturate all things. You might as well just give into it. You might as well just let them pull your strings through the indirect authority of strategically placed men. Itâ€™s just the way things are, after all. 
Or, you could question it all. You could question the almighty Unicorns. You could question the kings and queens and emperors and presidents and judges and lawyers and cops. You could question all authority, especially the so called authority of the state . Itâ€™s so easy even a sixth grader understands it (see opening quote). 
The alternative is devolving into a statist. A statist is a person who believes that a group of people have the right to force, coerce, enslave, rob, and murder others. Statism is a mental disorder brought on by years of indoctrination. The problem is that the majority of the worldâ€™s population has been conditioned and brainwashed into believing in the almighty power of the state. The problem is that the majority of people are too afraid to question the state, lest they become ostracized by the statist-junky status quo. The problem is that most people donâ€™t even know that they donâ€™t know that there is an alternativ e. 3.) Power Given to Authority Tends to Corrupt 
â€œI have as much authority as the Pope. I just donâ€™t have as many people who believe it.â€ 
GEORGE CARLIN 
Hereâ€™s a little secret: The Pope has unicorn powers. Then again, so does Colin Kaepernick . Keep in mind, the unicorn power is a righteous power. Itâ€™s a loving power that had, and has, the greatest of intentions. It created the universe, after all. And if you donâ€™t believe it, then feel free to rot in Hades, Illinois, located directly across the Mississippi River from St. Louis (according to Uncyclopedia: the content-free encyclopedia ). 
But I digress, the problem with power isnâ€™t its intent. The problem with power is that it tends to corrupt the one wielding it. And when it comes to absolute power â€“well, we all know where that leads. So since we all know that power tends to corrupt, and since we all want power anyway, it behooves us all to be circumspect both with it and against it. 
So it stands to reason not to give power to authority by believing it, but to use the power of authority instead by undermining it. And the best way to use the power of authority is to use it against the authority by questioning that authority. Itâ€™s a social leveling mechanism par excellence, similar to the Native American concept of counting coup. As Elie Weisel said, â€œEvery question possesses a power that does not lie within the answer.â€ We just need to use that power more effectively, especially against ourselves. Unicorns forbid! 4.) It Leads to An Ignorant and Apathetic Citizenry 
â€œThe totally convinced and the totally stupid have too much in common for the resemblance to be accidental.â€ 
ROBERT ANTON WILSON 
In the Unicorns we trust! Their powers are ubiquitous. Their symbols of control are hidden in all the worldâ€™s national flags, waiving influentially over the weakened masses. Their horns are the invisible bone funnels in everyoneâ€™s pie, siphoning power like it was blood pudding. Oh, I forgot to mention, blood pudding is a unicornâ€™s favorite dish. Obey, or go without! 
When it comes down to it, obedience to authority is a disease of laziness and indifference. It hinders the progressive evolution of our species by undermining anything that might challenge the current system for the better. Forget â€œfor the worst.â€ Fighting for the better at risk of the worst is far superior to shirking the better in fear of the worst. Similarly, worst case scenarios should not be avoided at the expense of healthy progress. Healthy progress should be embraced at the risk of worst case scenarios. Otherwise we donâ€™t get anywhere but where we are. Which is great if â€œwhere we areâ€ is perfect. But since perfection is not possible, we must be willing to risk upsetting the all-too-precious apple cart (or blood pudding cart, in this case) in order to progress. 
If, as Jose Ortega y Gasset said, â€œMan, whether he likes it or not, is a being forced by his nature to seek some higher authority. If he succeeds in finding it of himself then he is a superior man; if not, he is a mass-man and must receive it from his superiors,â€ then it is incumbent upon us to have the courage to shirk our inner mass-man in order to discover self-authority through self-questioning. As long as we are responsible with our own power, and as long as we donâ€™t allow anyone to hold too much power over us, then we might just be able to get out of our own way as a species. 
Because, as it stands now, we are definitely in our own way. Especially since following authority in todayâ€™s world means giving into debt-slavery , kowtowing to an expropriating state, and being unwitting accomplices to genocides past and ecocides future. As the authors of The Fuck-it Point surmised,â€œObedience to authority is not a valid excuse; not when doing what weâ€™re â€œsupposed to doâ€ means letting this civilization-machine continue to kill life on earth just to make commodities out of living beings and life easy only for some.â€ Share:"

On the other hand, the State of Wisconsin itself is only six percent black, while the U. S. population is 12 percent black.

21084,Prescription Painkiller Deaths Dropped 25% in States That Legalized Marijuana,Starkman,"In all states that have legalized medical marijuana, there has been a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. There is still heated controversy in the United States about whether or not marijuana should be legalized for recreational use, let alone medicinal purposes. 
Via HumansAreFree 

After reviewing a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014, youâ€™ll likely agree that itâ€™s much safer for cannabis to be doled out than most prescription opioids. For the study, researchers analyzed all deaths caused by opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2010 in the U.S.

Then, they determined the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic-related deaths using linear time-series regression models. The various models helped the researchers determine that in every state that legalized medical marijuana between the aforementioned years (a total of 13 states), there was a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. â€œThe difference is quite striking,â€ said Colleen Barry, the studyâ€™s co-author and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, to Newsweek.
It is hypothesized by the researchers that in states where medical marijuana is legal, patients are opting to smoke cannabis to alleviate their pain rather than consume prescription opiates, as the latter tend to cause side effects.
In addition, marijuana accounts for 0 deaths per year, whereas overdose of opiates are responsible for over 14,000 deaths annually (source). While the statistics speak volumes, not everyone is in agreement with the findings.
Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer at the national non-profit addiction treatment agency Phoenix House, says that the immediate reduction in overdose deaths is extremely unlikely to be a result of the herb being substituted. This, he says, is because physicians rarely prescribe marijuana for chronic pain.
â€œYou donâ€™t have primary care doctors in these states [prescribing] marijuana instead of Vicodin,â€ he argues.
The physician believes that the states that have legalized medical marijuana are more likely to actively treat and help prevent addiction. In his mind, this is a far more likely scenario for the decrease in overdose deaths. While more studies undoubtedly need to be carried out to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, this news is heartening at the very least.

21085,Colombian Opposition to Peace Deal Feeds Off Gay Rights Backlash - The New York Times,Nicholas Casey,"For the presidentâ€™s many opponents, it was never just about derailing the peace deal. As Colombia debated how to end 52 years of war with the nationâ€™s largest rebel group, there was the soccer player from the beloved national team who condemned the agreement, singled out President Juan Manuel Santos and accused him of practices that were â€œnot of God. â€ Then there were the angry marches across Colombia this summer against a gay education minister, which soon grew into a wellspring of opposition to Mr. Santosâ€™s government and the peace deal he was championing. â€œMy compatriots march in defense of family values,â€ declared Ãlvaro Uribe, the conservative former president who spearheaded the charge against the peace deal and rallied Colombiaâ€™s religious voters against it. Mr. Santosâ€™s push to end the war has earned him enormous recognition internationally, culminating in the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. But he has faced stiff resistance in Colombia, where he is confronted by a growing cultural divide. When Colombians last weekend rejected the peace deal between Mr. Santosâ€™s government and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the decision shocked the region and laid bare generations of anger at the rebels. Many Colombians felt the guerrillas would have gotten off too easily in a deal that would have allowed a vast majority of them to avoid prison. But critics of the agreement appear to have harnessed something else as well: a resurgent conservative movement, angered by Colombiaâ€™s socially liberal tilt in recent months. â€œThe opposition used that argument regarding gay marriage, abortion, religion to attract and rally against the peace accords,â€ said Juan Carlos GarzÃ³n, a researcher at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a research group in Colombia. â€œIt was an effective strategy to drive the most conservative voters against the peace agreement. â€ Colombia has long been one of the regionâ€™s most conservative countries. But the tone was beginning to change in the last year. In April, Colombiaâ€™s highest court legalized   marriage, and last year it removed barriers to adopting children for gay individuals and couples. The country, torn by long drug wars, legalized medical marijuana late last year. A push to lift restrictions on abortions also emerged this year as the Zika virus spread. Then came the deal with the FARC. For some conservatives, it was bridge too far: a pact with a Marxist guerrilla organization that had terrorized Colombia for decades. â€œPeople have used the reaction to the peace agenda to talk about a larger conservative rollback in Colombia, a broadened cultural war,â€ said Winifred Tate, an anthropology professor at Colby College in Maine who studies Colombia. The accordâ€™s defeat  â€”   aided by low turnout in regions that voted for the peace deal  â€”   allowed social conservatives to flex their muscle, as Mr. Santos was forced to court his opponents in an attempt to salvage what remained of the agreement. Two days after the vote, Mr. Santos took his negotiators to meet with a large group of evangelical Christian pastors to discuss their concerns. Mr. Santos must also negotiate with Mr. Uribe, his immediate predecessor, who has repeatedly called him a â€œtraitorâ€ for promoting a peace deal that includes reduced sentences for rebel war crimes. The two sparring leaders met on Wednesday, with Mr. Uribe outlining a list of demands like bans on political participation for rebels and punishments for those who had kidnapped children. And Mr. Uribe made a nod to his social conservative backers. â€œWe presented our worries about family values,â€ he said. Even after Mr. Santos won the peace prize on Friday, Mr. Uribe remained defiant, calling the peace accord â€œdamaging to democracyâ€ and demanding that Mr. Santos change it. While the Nobel Prize may provide a morale boost for the peace camp, some observers warned that the countryâ€™s deep polarization would continue. â€œItâ€™s not likely the agenda of the extreme right will change,â€ said Nazih Richani, a professor at Kean University in New Jersey who studies Colombia. Susana Correa, a lawmaker in Mr. Uribeâ€™s Democratic Center Party, said she believed the deal contained a kind of subtext that undermined family values and supported nontraditional views on gender and sexual orientation. Hours after Mr. Santos won the peace prize, Ms. Correa said her party would still be using this â€œnew era of modifications and correctionsâ€ to seek a more socially conservative text for the deal. â€œThe Catholic and evangelical churches have joined us in complaining that in no part of the agreements God is even named,â€ she said. The fight between social conservatives and Mr. Santosâ€™s government came to a boil this summer over education. Gina Parody, the countryâ€™s education minister, who is gay, proposed mixed bathrooms and changes to uniforms to put less emphasis on gender. She also proposed creating a manual for students related to sexual orientation, following an order by the countryâ€™s courts to do so. The proposed changes drew ire from the countryâ€™s far right. One politician accused Ms. Parody of â€œgay colonization. â€ By   thousands of protesters  â€”   supported by Mr. Uribe  â€”   gathered throughout Colombia, waving signs denouncing   marriage and urging the country to defend the traditional family. As the controversy over the manuals continued, Ms. Parody temporarily stepped down from her post, taking a job as one of the central figures in the campaign to support the peace agreement in the national referendum. Soon the two issues  â€”   the peace deal and the fight over sexual orientation and gender  â€”   became linked in the eyes of many. â€œColombians marched a month ago when the government tried to impose, through these manuals, gender ideology in Colombian education,â€ said Alejandro OrdoÃ±ez, Colombiaâ€™s inspector general at the time. Government officials, he argued, were â€œusing peace as an excuse to impose their gender ideology. â€ Evangelical Christian leaders were also starting to rally against the deal on moral terms, saying it did not offer justice to the victims. The war left more than 220, 000 dead and displaced five million. In a YouTube video posted last month, Johan Molina, a popular minister, complains that the agreement had not been â€œwritten in common language,â€ confusing its intent. He said a group of pastors and other experts had studied the terms and found that the deal conflicted with the Bible because of its leniency on the rebels. â€œThere has been no repentance of any of FARCâ€™s leaders, and the people canâ€™t give forgiveness to those who have not asked for it,â€ Pastor Molina tells his congregation in the video. The religious message against the vote was gaining traction beyond Christian leaders. Before the vote, Daniel Torres, a Colombian soccer player, produced an online video in which he urged Christians to vote against the deal. â€œI want to tell you that what you have come up with, and the practices you are doing, are not of God nor come from God,â€ Mr. Torres said, speaking to Mr. Santos while the video showed a photo of the president bowed at an indigenous cleansing. â€œThis will bring nothing good to our country. â€ Other religious leaders made the argument that the deal would benefit gay and transgender residents directly. Pastor Marco Fidel RamÃ­rez of the Family International Church in BogotÃ¡, the capital, said he believed the architects of the deal planned to use the agreement to advance   marriage, though he had no direct evidence to support that assertion. â€œThis was a fundamental objection and a danger to the natural family in Colombia,â€ he said. â€œA family in Colombia consists of a man and a woman. â€ Marcela SÃ¡nchez, the director of Diverse Colombia, a group representing gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, said the accord contained no such provisions. But, she said, the right waged a fierce disinformation battle to convince people otherwise, especially on social media. The   effect, in addition to derailing the peace deal, was increased homophobia, Ms. SÃ¡nchez said. After the failure in the referendum, Ms. Parody, the education minister who had campaigned for the deal, permanently resigned from her education post, leaving the country without its most prominent gay leader. â€œItâ€™s sad in this country that there are people who have more fear of homosexuality than war,â€ Ms. SÃ¡nchez said."

21087,Kids on Their Own in Calais: the Tip of an Iceberg-Cold World,Sam Albert,"Email 
Some eight to ten thousand refugees have been living in an improvised camp in Calais currently being demolished by French officials. All theyâ€™ve gotten from the French government so far has been tear gas and the bulldozers set to tear down the tents and shacks where they have survived amid the cold and mud thanks to the help of fellow refugees and humanitarian volunteers and organizations. The NGO Help Refugees said that as of 24 October it had a list of 1,028 â€œunaccompaniedâ€ children in the camp, 49 under the age of 13, one an 8-year-old boy. These are kids who lost their families at home, or were separated from them as they travelled across half the world thorough the most difficult and dangerous conditions imaginable. 
Many of these children â€“ about 40 percent, according to the NGO Terre dâ€™Asile â€“ came to Calais, on the English Channel, because they have family in the UK and are therefore legally entitled to asylum there. During the first ten months of this year, under public pressure, the UK admitted a grand total of 79. This came only after an enormous outcry among British people. A Parliamentary measure to admit all refugees under 13, sponsored by a prominent member of the House of Lords, who was himself given asylum in the UK as a 6-year-old fleeing the Nazi persecution of Jews, went largely ignored until the last week, when the British authorities finally let in 200. It took a strong protest from the British Dental Association to stop plans to x-ray the teeth of children claiming asylum to prove their age. Many other refugees in Calais are entitled to enter the UK because they have a spouse or other close relative to live with there, but neither the British nor French governments care to implement European Union laws and agreements. 
This is, in fact, official UK government policy. Prime Minister Theresa May was infamous for her rabidly anti-foreigner positions when she was Home Minister. She took the lead among her European counterparts in cutting off funding to Italian-led search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, calling saving lives a â€œpull factorâ€ for â€œthreats we faceâ€. 
When the French police attacked and destroyed about half the Calais camp earlier this year, 129 children simply went missing. A Help Refugees spokeswoman says she fears this will happen again, since no government will take responsibility for these children. One reason that many people do not want to leave the camp is that they have built up ties, mutual-help networks and other arrangements that enable them to survive. They have no reason to believe that the French and other authorities who have displayed nothing but alternating neglect and brutality will offer an acceptable solution to their predicament. These kids reached Calais after travelling through many other countries whose governments were no more welcoming than France. 
What will happen to these refugees when their camp is bulldozed? The plan is for them to be herded into buses, split up into small groups and sent to hundreds of â€œwelcome centresâ€ scattered across the country. Five of these centres have already been fire-bombed. Right now there are about 500 media people in Calais â€“ NGO members say they fear that when the camera lights go out, refugees who have refused to get on a bus â€œvoluntarilyâ€ will be attacked by security forces or the small fascist bands that a thousand police mysteriously cannot hold back sometimes. 
The biggest nationality group in the camp is people from Afghanistan, who literally crossed mountains and deserts to flee the mess the US and Nato made of their country. Under a recent agreement with the Western powers, the Afghan government is to accept the forcible return of its refugees in Europe, as many as hundreds of thousands. Ethiopians (whose government is closely allied with the US), Eritreans and other Africans are not generally considered deserving of refugee status. Trying to get by as an â€œillegalâ€ immigrant is the most rational choice for many people, rather than applying for asylum, getting fingerprinted and maybe expelled. Some people have come to Calais seeking safety in numbers after being forced out of smaller camps in Paris and elsewhere. 
The people in Calais are not just some unfortunate anomaly, an exception that proves the rule that the world is OK. Their desperate presence tells the truth about an unacceptable world dominated by a handful of countries that have prospered at the expense of the vast majority of the planetâ€™s people, through both plunder and war, and the normal workings of a global system of exploitation. The fact that there are 63.5 million refugees and displaced people in todayâ€™s world, according to the UN, is an irrefutable proof â€“ only one of too many â€“ that the capitalist-imperialist system does not work for humanity and the planet. 
While the British, French and other European governments squabble among themselves about who should help which immigrants, each taking in as few as possible as slowly as possible, some people not only refuse to accept this inhumanity but take responsibility to do something about it. A middle aged, middle class woman in the French city of Nice, near Italy, heard on her car radio that French police were blocking the cityâ€™s train station to keep out refugees who had walked across the border. She dropped her daily schedule, went to the station, invited refugees into her car and drove them to train stations where the police would not be expecting them. Someone snitched on her and she was arrested and hit with a huge fine. Overnight hundreds of people sent her enough money to pay it. A New York Times article refers to â€œa French underground railroad, moving African migrantsâ€. While lots of â€œcitizen collaborators tip off the French policeâ€, â€œa low-key network of citizen smugglers are countering police efforts in a quasi-clandestine resistance, angered by what they see as the French governmentâ€™s inhumane response to the crisis.â€ (4 October 2016) The â€œmigrant crisisâ€ that governments today consider a police problem could become part of a political crisis, with big questions at stake about what kind of society people want, or will accept. 
What do the imperialists, fighting amongst themselves to run this world, mean by the words â€œmigrant crisisâ€? For them, it is a â€œcrisisâ€ that a few people have slipped into Europe, the UK, the US, Australia and other imperialist fortresses. To promote racism, they call the Calais camp â€œthe jungle,â€ when their capitalist system has turned our planet into the dog-eat-dog place it is today. The real crisis is not Calais but the world. The systemâ€™s own workings are generating vast upheavals that no wall can hold back, and that cry out for the overthrow of this system in country after country. 
Postcript 28 October 
The prefect in charge of evacuating the camp pronounced â€œMission accomplishedâ€, meaning that the site has been emptied and the riot police will not allow anyone to come back. The departure was hastened by massive fires consuming tents and shelters, which the prefect claimed trhe migrants themselves had set because it was a â€œcustomâ€ in their cultures. According to the 28 October Le Monde , about a hundred refugees are sleeping in the cold and rainy streets of Calais, some of them minors, with no place to go. 
Some people who let seem to be very happy with their new lodgings, according to Le Monde and other media, but police are accompanying the buses taking them to nearly every corner of the country, with orders not to let anyone change their mind along the way. About 90 people were taken straight to jails, with no explanation as yet.

Illegal alien Muslim invaders have staged a mass protest in Paris over their treatment by French authorities following destruction of their makeshift camps. Masses of Muslim freeloaders sleeping in the streets joined local bleeding hearts to demonstrate at their encampment near the Stalingrad Metro station. UK Daily Mail (h/t therezam) One man held up a sign saying â€˜human, no beastâ€™ as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march, which happened late last night. It came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs. The fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. There had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. It followed thousands of Muslim freeloaders arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. While some 5000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. Up to 3000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. Shortly before Mondayâ€™s clearance French president Francois Hollande said: â€˜We wonâ€™t tolerate the camps any longer.â€™ Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: â€˜We are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.â€™ CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a â€˜gradual operationâ€™ which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone."
21090,Indian Teenager Begins a Lonely Climb in Womenâ€™s Golf - The New York Times,Lisa D. Mickey,"Aditi Ashok is only 18 years old, but like any aspiring pro golfer, she knows the story of Ok Hee Ku and Se Ri Pak, who in the 1980s and â€™90s changed womenâ€™s golf by starting the South Korean wave. Ashok may be that trailblazer for India. She was among the early leaders in the womenâ€™s tournament at the 2016 Rio Olympics and parlayed that experience into two victories in the fall on the Ladies European Tour, where she earned top rookie honors for 2016 and finished second in earnings with seven   finishes. Golf is an emerging sport somewhere behind cricket, soccer, field hockey and tennis in India, a nation of more than 1. 3 billion people. But that may change soon, thanks to players like Ashok. Anirban Lahiri is the only native of India with full status on the PGA Tour. Currently ranked 86th in the world, Lahiri has been ranked as high as 33rd. Arjun Atwal, currently ranked 969th, remains the only Indian winner on the PGA Tour, with his victory at the 2010 Wyndham Championship. Daniel Chopra, winner of two PGA Tour titles, grew up in India but is a Swedish citizen. But no Indian woman has ever won an L. P. G. A. Tour event. Ashok, at No. 100, is the   Indian woman since Simi Mehra, who played on the tour for several years beginning in 1997 and attained a   ranking of No. 17 in 1998. Only six Indian women are currently world ranked, compared with 148 Indian men. â€œGolf is definitely growing in India, but for the number of people we have, we still donâ€™t have enough players, especially women players,â€ said Ashok, who is from Bangalore. Ashok found herself in the spotlight when she returned home as an Olympian last summer. Weeks later, she won the Ladies European Tour event in India and added a second win the next week in Qatar. â€œThere was clearly a huge sense of pride from the local crowd when Aditi won the Hero Womenâ€™s Indian Open,â€ said Bethan Cutler, who handles communications for the Ladies European Tour. Cutler called Ashokâ€™s win a â€œgame changer for female golfersâ€ in India. When asked what she thought it would take for her country to embrace golf, Ashok was pragmatic. â€œItâ€™s not just about golf, and it takes more than talent,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s the culture. Itâ€™s about sports in general, and once the   changes and girls start picking up sports, there will be more players in golf. â€ The Professional Golf Tour of India offered 25 tournaments last year for male professionals, many of whom also competed on the Asian Tour and the European Tour. But Indian women had fewer opportunities, with 16 tournaments on their Hero Womenâ€™s Professional Golf Tour. With significantly fewer women playing the game in India, it took more than a decade for the small professional Womenâ€™s Golf Association of India to grow to 30 members. Champika Sayal, secretary general of the association, and Mehra helped establish a professional tour for Indian women. Mehra organized a Skins Game in 2005, inviting three L. P. G. A. players to India to play an exhibition. A young Indian pro also competed in the event, alongside Mehra. â€œI remember it being quite historic and emotional for everyone involved,â€ said Heather   one of the invited pros and now the L. P. G. A.â€™s chief tour operations officer. Mehra won 25 amateur tournaments throughout Asia before turning professional and becoming the L. P. G. A.â€™s first Indian player by qualifying for the tour in 1996. She won three times on what is now the   Symetra Tour and posted two   finishes on the L. P. G. A. tour, where she played until 2008. Professional sports for women was a foreign concept in India in the 1990s, when Mehra began her golf career. She had no support from her country on any level and was encouraged only by her peers on the L. P. G. A. Tour. â€œI felt completely alone and a bit lost during my first few years on tour,â€ said Mehra, now 44. â€œBut I had amazing women as my idols and friends who made me feel like I belonged there. â€ Those L. P. G. A. peers donated their used golf equipment and balls to Mehra, who shipped the golf gear to India to help girls get started in the game. She would travel back and forth between the United States and India, shuttling equipment, playing in tournaments to support fledgling Indian events, and reminding her compatriots that opportunity existed. â€œItâ€™s a little easier when you see someone else do it,â€ Ashok said when asked about Indiaâ€™s history in golf. â€œI still listen to Simi because of all sheâ€™s gone through. â€ The number of Indian women playing professional golf still lags behind the number of female pros in many other nations, but it has grown from Mehraâ€™s early roster of one. At last yearâ€™s Hero Womenâ€™s Indian Open, now sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour, the field of 113 players included 17 Indians. The growth of the Womenâ€™s Indian Open has become a visible milestone since the first national championship for Indian women was started in 2007 by Sayal, Mehra and others  â€”   43 years after the menâ€™s inaugural national championship. Another sign is the increase in girls playing golf. â€œThere were three or four girls between ages 7 to 12 when I was a junior,â€ Ashok said. â€œNow, there are between 15 to 20 girls. Thatâ€™s not a lot, but itâ€™s getting better. â€ Access to golf is also an issue in India, Ashok said, adding that there were six courses within one hour of her Bangalore home. â€œWe donâ€™t have a lot of space in India, but even if there were more driving ranges, it would help make golf more accessible and help promote the game,â€ she said. Ashok embraced golf at 5Â½ while having breakfast with her parents at a golf club in Bangalore. Their breakfast table overlooked the driving range, where players were hitting balls. After breakfast, the family walked over to the practice green, where Ashok was handed a putter and some golf balls. Two hours later, she left in love with a new game. She and her parents began taking lessons and playing golf together. â€œWe were very intrigued,â€ said her father, Pandit Gudlamani Ashok, who works in real estate. Aditi played her first round of golf when she was just over 6. Her father thought she would be tired, but was surprised when she wanted to play more. Her mother, Mash Ashok, said: â€œWe played regularly as a family, but as soon as she was keen and started playing it competitively and started to set her goals, we couldnâ€™t play as often because of her schedule. It was more about being her support than playing golf ourselves. â€ India did not offer separate tournaments for girls when Ashok began playing, so from age 7 to 12, she competed with boys. She could not outhit the boys in distance, so she sharpened her short game as the equalizer. Ashok captured attention in her homeland for the first time at 13 when she went head to head against Mehra in a 2011 professional event. She beat Mehra in a playoff. â€œThat was huge,â€ Ashok said. â€œSimi is a fierce competitor, but she encouraged me. When I won that event, I knew I wanted to be a professional. â€ When Ashok won the Womenâ€™s Indian Open in November, she edged out the L. P. G. A. veterans Brittany Lincicome and Belen Mozo. In Qatar, she won by three shots over the European Solheim Cup player Caroline Hedwall. â€œAditi has a bright future, and India has an iconic young female golfer,â€ Sayal said. â€œGolf is finally coming of age for women in India. â€ Ashok passed another milestone in early December when she earned high conditional status at the L. P. G. A.â€™s annual qualifying tournament in Florida, which will allow her to play in a number of tour events and give her the opportunity to move up should she play well. Now the second Indian member of the L. P. G. A. Ashok plans to play at least six European Tour tournaments this year, and as many L. P. G. A. events as possible. â€œWhat she has achieved is truly remarkable,â€ Mehra said. â€œI wish her all the success in a wonderful journey. â€ Others hoping to follow Ashokâ€™s success include seven Indian women who competed in the recent Ladies European Tour qualifying tournament in Morocco. When Ashok won the 2015 event, there were only two Indians in the field. â€œI think our country never thought that we could have contenders in golf,â€ Ashok said. â€œBut if golfers from a small country like Korea can have success, it can be done by top players from India. â€"

""So there are very specific issues to specific industries, but there won't be special deals and it's absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and Scotland will not,â€ he said. 
â€œI accept on one level, if we are leaving the EU then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can, I think, continue in a way that doesn't involve tariffs or barriers,â€ the secretary continued. 
British and Scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the Brexit process, with Scotland asking for an â€œequalâ€ role in the negotiations. 
During an EU referendum on June 23, Scotland voted 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the 28-member bloc, but Britons voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has made it clear that she will complete the Brexit process by 2019 and that Scotland holds no veto over it. 
Scotland, in response, has threatened to secede from the UK in order to preserve its EU membership, which in turn guarantees the nationâ€™s access to the EU single market. 
Last year, Scotlandâ€™s first attempt for independence from the UK was blocked by voters in a referendum. 
Mundell told MSPs that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming Scottish businesses, even more than Brexit. 
â€œIt is already evident, because I understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in Scotland,â€ he said. 
Experts warn that in case of a hard Brexit, the UK may lose its preferential access to the EU's single market and suffer from soured relations with other EU members. Loading ... "
21092,"Donald Trump Fires Corey Lewandowski, His Campaign Manager - The New York Times","Maggie Haberman, Alexander Burns and Ashley Parker","Donald J. Trump fired his divisive campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Monday as he confronts urgent challenges heading into the general election  â€”   a strategic shift after months of concerns from party officials and donors about Mr. Lewandowskiâ€™s stewardship of the campaign. The exit occurred a month before Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is to secure the official nomination at the partyâ€™s convention in Cleveland. It reflected a broader adjustment by the campaign as it grapples with a late start to   anxiety among party leaders and a skeletal staff  â€”   all while Mr. Trumpâ€™s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, swiftly builds out her operations in swing states. Mr. Trump had faced increasing concerns from allies and donors, as well as his children, over whether Mr. Lewandowski, who had never before worked on a national race, was able to direct a battle against Mrs. Clinton. Among those who had voiced concern was Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who told Mr. Trump last week that relations between his committee and Mr. Lewandowski had become increasingly strained, and that a change would be welcome, according to three people briefed on the discussion. Republicans across the spectrum welcomed the firing as a positive step, but they suggested that it needed to be followed by consistent changes in performance from the candidate himself. Mr. Lewandowski was fired at a Monday morning meeting with Mr. Trump and Mr. Trumpâ€™s two older sons, Eric and Donald Jr. said two others briefed on the meeting, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Trump and Mr. Lewandowski had what was described as a â€œvery open conversation. â€ Mr. Lewandowskiâ€™s time was primarily spent on the campaign trail with the candidate, and    aspects of the operation were largely handled by the chief strategist, Paul Manafort. For months, Mr. Lewandowski had been a lightning rod for controversy, making headlines about himself that overshadowed his boss. This included his being charged with misdemeanor battery  â€”   a charge later dropped  â€”   after he was accused of grabbing a reporter as she approached Mr. Trump in Florida in March. It was not immediately clear whether someone new would be named campaign manager, but it was clear that the existing Trump team believed most of the duties had already been assumed by other people, principally Mr. Manafort. â€œUltimately, Paul is in charge,â€ Barry Bennett, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said. â€œHeâ€™s got the experience to help get Mr. Trump across the finish line. â€ As a young Republican operative, Mr. Manafort helped manage the 1976 convention floor for Gerald Ford in his showdown with Ronald Reagan, the last time Republicans entered a convention with no candidateâ€™s having clinched the nomination. He performed a similar function for Reagan in 1980, and played leading roles in the 1988 and 1996 conventions, for George Bush and Bob Dole. Trump allies and critics alike regarded Mr. Lewandowski as a fierce defender of Mr. Trumpâ€™s idiosyncratic approach to the presidential race. At a moment when many in the party have pressed Mr. Trump to soften his message and build a more conventional political operation, Mr. Lewandowski hewed closely to the mantra he had developed during the Republican primaries: â€œLet Trump be Trump. â€ The limitations of that approach have been on vivid display in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has struggled to raise money from establishment donors, and he has drawn fresh criticism from Republicans and Democrats for his racial attacks on a federal judge and his revived proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in the wake of the gay nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla. With the Republican National Convention looming, he faces the task of broadening his team to include people with previous presidential campaign experience and uniting a party that is often not in lock step behind him. Mr. Trump has also been turning his attention to   for the first time, a task over which Mr. Lewandowski had assumed oversight, and one that has gone slowly for the campaign. The campaign has aired no ads for the general election, and neither Mr. Trump or his advisers have yet to publicly bless a â€œsuper PACâ€ that could raise significant amounts of money to support his presidential bid. â€œIt would be welcome if new people come in who have more experience and can move him to a more inclusive, more   campaign,â€ said Fred Malek, a fixture in Republican Party  . But he added: â€œHow much the absence of a national kind of campaign is due to Corey and how much is due to Donald is kind of hard to tell. It looks to me like Trump drives his own train. â€ In announcing Monday morning that Mr. Lewandowski â€œwill no longer be working with the campaign,â€ Hope Hicks, the campaignâ€™s spokeswoman, said in a statement that â€œthe campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication, and we wish him the best in the future. â€ The firing followed regular reports of turmoil in the campaign. Mr. Lewandowski was often at odds with Mr. Manafort, who was brought on in March when the candidate seemed poised for a lengthy fight over Republican delegates. Mr. Lewandowski was said to have resisted certain moves that would have increased the number of staff members, at times blocking Mr. Manafort from making hires or later undoing them. But the people briefed on Mr. Lewandowskiâ€™s departure said the circumstances went well beyond any one episode or relationship. One stressed that the move had been in the works for many weeks, particularly since it had become clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee. Mr. Trumpâ€™s son Donald Jr. described the split as â€œamicableâ€ in an interview with NBC. And Mr. Lewandowski gave a series of interviews Monday afternoon in which he tried to brush aside questions about the internal particulars of his departure. He said he wished nothing but the best for Mr. Trump, and suggested that Mr. Trumpâ€™s doing well could only be good for him. â€œIf Donald Trump wins, thatâ€™s good for Corey Lewandowski,â€ Mr. Lewandowski said on CNN. He played down any suggestion of tension between him and Mr. Trumpâ€™s children, and said every campaign expanded its operations for a general election. Mr. Lewandowski, 42, a New Hampshire resident with deep ties to the state, had made himself a delegate to the convention months ago and is still the chairman of that stateâ€™s delegation. Few inside the campaign were given any warning about the dismissal of Mr. Lewandowski, who was on the campaignâ€™s daily 8:30 a. m. conference call on Monday, according to a person briefed on the developments. Mr. Bennett, the senior Trump campaign adviser, declined to predict whether there would be other significant changes. But he said Mr. Lewandowski deserved credit for helping Mr. Trump get where he is. â€œThere is no doubt what Corey did in the primary was amazing  â€”   helping him get more votes than anyone else has ever gotten, a record turnout in 45 out of the 50 states, record low expenditures,â€ Mr. Bennett said. â€œNone of thatâ€™s ever been done before. â€"

21094,Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival,Danny Haiphong,"2016 elections by Danny Haiphong 
Fears of Trump should not obscure the fact that Barack Obamaâ€™s reign was a disaster. â€œBlack America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy, and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior.â€ The struggle continues, but â€œit is important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard.â€ Obama's Departure is One Reason to Feel Optimism for Trump's Arrival by Danny Haiphong 
â€œOnly gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency.â€ 
Thousands have taken to the streets across the country to protest Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 elections. The protests have mainly centered on Trump's racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spewed during his campaign. Protesters have yet to wrestle with Trump's positions on foreign policy and trade that made him a pariah to the majority of the ruling class. The struggle against capitalism and imperialism in the US remains immature even in the midst of positive growth in the movement against police brutality and racism in recent years. While Trump's overt bigotry gives cause for protest, there is one benefit of the Trump moment that should not be understated. That benefit is the much needed conclusion of the Obama era. 
Democrats across the US are in a state of mourning over the departure of Obama. Democrats heralded Obama as the quintessential professional and consummate politician. His celebrity was peppered by the appearance of intelligence and rationality in the face of so-called Republican ""obstructionism."" Obama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement. His Administration possessed a vast marketing apparatus that defended him as the lesser-evil alternative to the racist vitriol of the White Man's Republican Party. 
â€œObama's rule was advertised as a victory for the Black Freedom movement.â€ 
Black Agenda Report was one of the few on the left that warned of the dangers of Obama in 2008. Once elected, Obama became virtually untouchable. Criticisms of his policies were condemned as racist and insensitive to the needs of Black America. The needs of Black America and the entire left for that matter suddenly became aligned with whatever Obama did. Obama moved forward to protect the banks, escalate war, and erect the largest national security state ever assembled. He instantly became the austerity President, waging a war of privatization on public education with the expressed plans to do the same to Social Security. Only gridlock saved Social Security and Medicare from being privatized during his Presidency. 
The full scope of Obama's legacy has been discussed in earlier issues and will not be analyzed here. What is important is that the left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism. No longer will the left be able to fall back on the first Black President to sanitize his record. Obama's immigration policies deported nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants with little protest. His Administration painted itself as a friend of women and LGBTQ identified people despite the fact that his policy of proxy and drone warfare murdered tens of thousands of women and children in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Honduras. 
â€œThe left will no longer have Obama to defend its alignment with US imperialism.â€ 
Obama was able to conduct a greater assault on oppressed people than the prior Bush Administration, making him the most effective evil Wall Street could buy. Obama took over as President in a period where the US was mired in two unpopular occupations abroad and an economic crisis at home. These conditions prompted the ruling class to choose Obama as the required form of counterinsurgency necessary to crush resistance before it started. After making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class. Eight years later, Black America is in a worse condition than before, working class people as a whole have lost ground to a low-wage economy , and the world is closer to a World War III scenario than at any point prior. 
The massive protests to Trump's victory are in part a release of popular energy brought on by the departure of Obama. Unrest began with the formation of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. However, neither of these movements articulated Obama's role in creating the conditions for social insurgency and movement. The 2016 elections changed the landscape dramatically. The Sanders and Trump campaigns set millions into motion in protest of the two-party establishment. Obama's departure will be another breath of fresh air into the internal rot of the imperialist system. It is thus important to ensure that the protests against Trump are not allowed to be channeled back into the Democratic Party graveyard. 
â€œAfter making a number of promises to end ""dumb wars"" and institute a single payer healthcare system, Obama entered office ready to the bidding of the ruling class.â€ 
Obama will leave Trump a set of conditions that he cannot possibly maintain without popular unrest. Obama departs office only inches from World War III with Russia and China. Poverty and wealth inequality worsened under his administration . Not even clever distortions of statistics could hide the large number of workers currently unemployed or underemployed in the low-wage economy. School closures, food stamp cuts, and bank bailouts have unleashed the neo-liberal wasteland that Trump spoke about in his campaign. 
It appears early on that the left has rejected the viability of Trump's calls to regulate the banks and renegotiate trade deals in favor of working people. Many have ignored Trumpâ€™s â€œpopulistâ€ rhetoric and have focused all the energy of resistance on his white supremacist proposals to ban Muslims and deport millions of undocumented people. However, this moment is just as much about Obama's departure as it is Trump's arrival. The US imperialist system is facing multiple crises that relate directly back to the economic stagnation of global capitalism. It would be a mistake not to demand Trump stay true to his â€œpopulismâ€ just as it was a mistake when the left failed to demand Obama stay true to his promises. Whatever the case, the departure of Obama is a welcome site, and the left should use the room afforded by it to wage an intensified effort to build the organizational basis for social revolution in our time.

21095,World wildlife â€˜falls by 58% in 40 yearsâ€™,Alex Ansary,"World wildlife â€˜falls by 58% in 40 yearsâ€™ 10/27/2016 
BBC NEWS Global wildlife populations have fallen by 58% since 1970, a report says. 
The Living Planet assessment, by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and WWF, suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach two-thirds among vertebrates by 2020. 
The figures suggest that animals living in lakes, rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses. 
Human activity, including habitat loss, wildlife trade, pollution and climate change contributed to the declines. 
Dr Mike Barrett. head of science and policy at WWF, said: â€œItâ€™s pretty clear under â€˜business as usualâ€™ we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations. But I think now weâ€™ve reached a point where there isnâ€™t really any excuse to let this carry on. 
â€œWe know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations â€“ it really is now down to us to act.â€ 
However the methodology of the report has been criticised. Image copyright CARLOS DREWS / WWF Image caption The report looked at data collected on 3,700 species of vertebrates over the last 40 years 
The Living Planet Report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worldâ€™s wildlife. 
For freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970 Dr Mike Barrett, WWF 
This analysis looked at 3,700 different species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians and reptiles â€“ about 6% of the total number of vertebrate species in the world. 
The team collected data from peer-reviewed studies, government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and NGOs. 
Any species with population data going back to 1970, with two or more time points (to show trends) was included in the study. 
The researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time. 
Some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data (there are many records on Arctic and near Arctic birds, for example) or very little data (tropical amphibians, for example). The report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture. 
The last report, published in 2014, estimated that the worldâ€™s wildlife populations had halved over the last 40 years. 
This assessment suggests that the trend has continued: since 1970, populations have declined by an average of 58%. 
Dr Barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others. 
â€œWe do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment â€“ for freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970. This is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems, and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building, for example.â€ 
It also highlighted other species, such as African elephants , which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching, and sharks, which are threatened by overfishing. 
If pressures â€“ overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade for example â€“ increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse Dr Robin Freeman, ZSL 
The researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of 2% each year, and warn that if nothing is done, wildlife populations could fall by 67% (below 1970 levels) by the end of the decade. 
Dr Robin Freeman, head of ZSLâ€™s Indicators & Assessments Unit, said: â€œBut thatâ€™s assuming things continue as we expect. If pressures â€“ overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade, for example â€“ increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse. 
â€œBut one of the things I think is most important about these stats, these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations â€“ they are not extinctions. By and large they are not vanishing, and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it.â€ Image copyright SCOTT DICKERSON Image caption There are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worldâ€™s vertebrates 
However, Living Planet reports have drawn some criticisms. 
There are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy Stuart Pimm, Duke University 
Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University in the United States, said that while wildlife was in decline, there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure. 
â€œThere are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very, very sketchy,â€ he told BBC News. 
â€œFor example, if you look at where the data comes from, not surprisingly, it is massively skewed towards western Europe. 
â€œWhen you go elsewhere, not only do the data become far fewer, but in practice they become much, much sketchierâ€¦ there is almost nothing from South America, from tropical Africa, there is not much from the tropics, period. Any time you are trying to mix stuff like that, it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean. 
â€œTheyâ€™re trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single numberâ€¦. Itâ€™s flawed.â€ 
But Dr Freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world. 
â€œItâ€™s completely true that in some regions and in some groups, like tropical amphibians for example, we do have a lack of data. But thatâ€™s because there is a lack of data. 
â€œWeâ€™re confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline. 
â€œItâ€™s entirely possible that species that arenâ€™t being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse â€“ but Iâ€™d be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed. â€œ"
21096,It Took Less Than 12 Hours For Eric Trump To Break The Law On Election Day,April Hamlin,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Well, that sure didnâ€™t take long. Only 12 hours into Election Day and Eric Trump has already broken the law. 
The Trump family isnâ€™t known for their ability to follow the law. Eric Trump apparently decided to start off his day by voting for his narcissistic dad and then breaking the law by posting a picture of his completed ballot on Twitter. Image via Buzzfeed 
This just happens to violate New York election law. Oops. But hey, itâ€™s not like this has been a law for a long time right? Only 126 years. The law stipulates that any person who â€œ[s]hows his ballot after it is prepared for voting, to any person so as to reveal the contents â€¦ is guilty of a misdemeanor.â€ 
Eric Trump was quickly notified that his tweet, featuring a pic of his ballot, was illegal. Image via Buzzfeed 
The law was recently challenged by a group of voters who asked a federal judge to issue an injunction that would allow voters to take ballot selfies. The judge denied their request, ruling on Nov. 3 that, â€œThe publicâ€™s interest in orderly elections outweighs the plaintiffsâ€™ interest in taking and posting ballot selfies.â€ 
According to the judge, the posting of ballot selfies would slow down the voting process, causing unnecessary delays, and threaten the guarantee of â€œelection integrity.â€ 
Eric Trump eventually removed his tweet, but thanks to screenshots, it hasnâ€™t actually gone away. I have to ask at this point, canâ€™t these people get anything right? Seriously, they managed to screw up voting? By breaking the law? With Twitter ? Of course, they did.

[â€œ[W]e cannot deny the legacy of racism that continues to drive inequality in how the justice system is experienced by so many Americans,â€ Obama wrote in his 56 page essay.  Obama cited studies from the NAACP showing that   and Hispanics were more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officials and suffer stricter penalties in court. â€œIf we are to chart honestly the path for criminal justice reform, we must confront the role of race and bias in shaping the policies that led us to this point,â€ Obama wrote.

21099,A Dream That Survived Life in a War Zone and Life on the Streets - The New York Times,Emily Palmer,"Idi Diallo started playing soccer when he was 5, living in a small Ivory Coast village, kicking a ball on his family farm through two rocks that served as the goal. Even as he played, he could see troops fighting in the distance and hear gunfire ringing out in the civil wars that raged through his childhood. He practiced every day, dreaming of playing in professional European soccer leagues. He had never seen a soccer game on television  â€”   played on pristine fields with roaring fans  â€”   but at 11, he left his family for Abidjan, the countryâ€™s largest city, to play for a local team for the next three years. He also joined the Ivory Coast national team and traveled to Ghana, where the team made the semifinals in a tournament of African nations. In 2010, he got a chance to play in Italy for the AC Milan Football Academy Camp, a youth program sponsored by the elite Italian football league. But when a relative in Milan was unable to house him, he decided to pursue his dream in the United States. Then 15, Mr. Diallo boarded a plane with a friend of his brotherâ€™s and headed to New York. They settled in the Bronx, but when his companion returned to Africa a month later, Mr. Diallo found himself alone on the streets. A practicing Muslim, Mr. Diallo found refuge at the Musa Mosque Islamic Center in the Bronx, where he often slept in the prayer hall. He also informally played soccer with the Fordham University team. â€œHeâ€™d have played me, but I didnâ€™t have a diploma,â€ Mr. Diallo said of the coach, recalling an interaction on the field. â€œHe said, â€˜Where do you come from?â€™ And I said, â€˜You donâ€™t want to know. â€™â€ Then a friend at the university invited him to play in pickup games at Heritage Field, the site of the original Yankee Stadium. That is where Mr. Diallo met Fernando Rodriguez, a   high school basketball coach battling advanced melanoma, who watched the games. Mr. Rodriguez approached Mr. Diallo after a game to compliment his performance. Mr. Diallo spoke little English, but he recognized Mr. Rodriguezâ€™s accent and responded in Spanish  â€”   the language he had chosen to learn at the soccer academy in Ivory Coast. â€œSo from then, we started talking,â€ Mr. Diallo said with a smile. â€œIt was a good moment. As time went by, he asked me about my life. I donâ€™t like talking about my problems the past is in the past. But heâ€™d take me to eat at a nearby cafeteria, and heâ€™d ask small questions. He asked where I lived, and I said, â€˜No house for me,â€™ and he invited me to stay with him. â€ A month after their initial meeting, Mr. Diallo accepted an invitation for a   dinner and saw Mr. Rodriguezâ€™s spare room. â€œThere was no way Iâ€™d find something better than that,â€ he recalled thinking. Mr. Diallo, then 17, moved in and enrolled at Urban Assembly Media High School in Manhattan, starting as a 10th grader. He took classes to learn English and joined the soccer team, which won the championship in his first year. Mr. Rodriguez became Mr. Dialloâ€™s legal guardian and started filling out paperwork to adopt him. But his health continued to decline, and a year after taking in Mr. Diallo, he was admitted to a hospital. This time, it was Mr. Dialloâ€™s turn to take care of the man who had taken him in. He took warm meals to him and visited him often, updating him on his success at school. Mr. Rodriguez still managed to sponsor Mr. Diallo for his green card and help him apply for legal immigration status. Four months after Mr. Rodriguez died, Mr. Diallo learned that his immigration application had been approved. â€œWhen he passed away, it was hard,â€ Mr. Diallo said, shaking his head. â€œHeâ€™d become my father. â€ He played a game the day of Mr. Rodriguezâ€™s funeral. And he continued classes. â€œI had to stay in school,â€ he said. â€œI couldnâ€™t give up on something heâ€™d helped me work toward. â€ On a cold November morning, Mr. Diallo sat inside Create Young Adult Residences, a transitional housing program serving men 18 to 25, where he has lived since February 2015. Create is affiliated with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Mr. Diallo, now 20, recalls with pride the life he has lived after his mentorâ€™s death. He graduated from high school in June and was accepted to both the College of Staten Island and LaGuardia Community College. It is a far different future from the one he imagined in Ivory Coast, where he spent few years getting a formal education schools were often closed during the wars. He received a $2, 000 scholarship from the National Association for Education and Homeless Children and Youth. The New York Public Library awarded him a laptop for academic excellence, and Catholic Charities used $350 from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to pay for his schoolbooks. Financial aid will cover his academic costs for the first two years at both schools. It will not cover his room and board, but he qualifies for an $800 rental subsidy from the city. In addition to working part time as a waiter, bringing in about $600 a month, he plays midfielder for Boca Juniors   affiliated with Argentinaâ€™s premier student soccer league. He travels to Long Island three days a week to practice, and has had tryouts with professional soccer clubs across the country, including the San Francisco Deltas and LA Galaxy II. Additional tryouts are scheduled for FC Miami City and Orlando City Soccer Club in January. He has also been invited for a return tryout in Los Angeles later in January but is unable to afford the plane fare. He laughed and shook his head, reflecting on the future, hopeful yet unwilling to wish too much. â€œIf God gets me on a team  â€”   whatever team  â€”   this year, and I do well . ..,â€ he said, his words trailing off. â€œWith agents watching those games, you never know. â€ He is waiting to choose a college until he hears back from professional soccer teams, and plans to start classes after tryouts conclude in February, studying business accounting or physical therapy. If he makes a team this year, he said, he plans to continue school in that city. Regardless of where the next few months take him, Mr. Diallo said, he will keep working to become a professional soccer player. â€œI could do without anything  â€”   live on the street  â€”   to play soccer,â€ he said. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve done that. Iâ€™ve been dreaming about this day since I was born. â€"
21100,"Vincent Viola, Nominee for Army Secretary, Drops Out - The New York Times",Susanne Craig,"Vincent Viola, a billionaire Wall Street trader and President Trumpâ€™s nominee for secretary of the Army, abruptly withdrew his name for the post on Friday night after concluding it would be too difficult to untangle himself from his business ties, two government officials said. Mr. Viola is an owner of the Florida Panthers hockey club and a majority shareholder in Virtu Financial and Eastern Air Lines, among a number of other business interests. This week The New York Times reported that Mr. Viola had been negotiating to swap his stake in Eastern Air Lines for a stake in Swift Air, an airline with government subcontracts. If his nomination had continued, he would have faced certain scrutiny for potentially becoming a government official who benefits from federal contracts. The Trump administration did not announce his withdrawal, which was reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News, but a senior administration official and a Pentagon official separately confirmed his decision, which the White House accepted Friday. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Viola is a 1977 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he last served in the Army Reserves at the rank of major. He remained connected to the military through donations to West Point, including to the academyâ€™s Combating Terrorism Center. A former Pentagon official and close friend said Mr. Viola was devastated over having to withdraw from what he described as a lifelong dream job. But the former official said Mr. Viola felt he was unable to sell his interest in some of his holdings because doing so could have destroyed those companies. His decision followed weeks of negotiations between his lawyers and the government as they sought to find a solution. Ultimately, they could not. Mr. Viola has a net worth of almost $1. 8 billion and is a   of Virtu. Virtu had planned to go public in 2014, but pulled the plug on the move because of choppy markets and lingering questions around how   trading firms like Virtu make money. In a regulatory filing at the time, Virtu said regulators were looking into its trading practices. It is not known if this issue played a role in Mr. Violaâ€™s decision to withdraw his name for the Army secretary job, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation. His decision to withdraw comes the same week another of Mr. Trumpâ€™s appointees, Anthony Scaramucci, was told he would not get a top job at the White House amid concerns about the recent sale of his company to a large Chinese conglomerate. In an episode unrelated to the finances of Mr. Viola, it was recently revealed that he was involved in an altercation in August: He was accused of punching a concessions worker at a racehorse auction in Saratoga Springs, N. Y. No charges were brought against him. Mr. Viola was one of the first nominations Mr. Trump issued the day he was inaugurated. â€œVincent Viola, everybody likes Vincent,â€ Mr. Trump said just hours after his   as he signed orders nominating his cabinet."
21101,Exclusive â€” A Star Is Born: Rep. Claudia Tenney Celebrates Memorial Day on Rolling Thunder Ride with Rex Tillerson - Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,"Rep. Claudia Tenney ( ) a freshman conservative House GOP member from New York State, rode with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the Rolling Thunder in Washington, D. C. on Memorial Day.[  In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News after the fact, Tenney said she was honored to join Tillerson as the only member of Congress on the Rolling Thunder ride to remember prisoners of war and those missing in action on Memorial Day weekend.  Tenney told Breitbart News: It was really cool. Harley reached out to me and said â€˜hey we see youâ€™re a Harley rider and a member of Congress. Do you want to go on a ride?â€™ I was like â€˜sure, but the complication of getting my bike down there is a lot.â€™ They said â€˜well, weâ€™ll provide you oneâ€™ and I was like â€˜super.â€™ So they had this whole little ride on Saturday night and they had the guy who owns the Harley in Annapolis and so we went to his house. When we went to go on the ride, we all met at the Harley offices on Constitution and it was funny â€”  all of a sudden in rides Rex Tillerson with like two people. We didnâ€™t want to say anything because the Secretary of State was riding with us, but we went for a ride â€”  it was like an hour and a half. We went out through the Virginia countryside and it was like the CEO of Harley, the CFO, the government operations people, two other people and it was just fun. He was like right in front of me â€”  it was like him, then a Secret Service guy and then me. So we just rode together. Heâ€™s such a nice guy. He was so down to earth and everything, he was just fun. We rode all over the beautiful countryside in Virginia, it was kind of like being in upstate New York. That was kind of neat and then we ended up at Josh Boltenâ€™s house for dinner, you can see him in the pictures, and then the next day we all ended up at Rolling Thunder and rode with him and he was just incredible going around and saying hello to everybody and posing for pictures and mostly I think he was just so gracious. I was really impressed and I had a chance to talk to him about some things about the job and Trump and it was a really interesting opportunity to sort of talk with him. He was sort of stunned that I was on my own bike. Heâ€™s like â€˜youâ€™re on your own bike?â€™ and I was like â€˜yeah, I ride my own.â€™ It was cool. He was just incredibly nice.  Tenney rides a Softail Deluxe back home, but for the Rolling Thunder ride, Harley Davidson lent her a Heritage Softail for the weekend. She rode behind Tillerson in the Rolling Thunder ride, and told Breitbart News that the U. S. Secretary of State was a â€œgood rider. â€ â€œI rode behind him so I got to watch the whole time,â€ Tenney said.  Former Idaho Governor, U. S. senator, and Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne also joined them on the ride. He said: It was great doing Rolling Thunder. I always wanted to do it. My son, whoâ€™s an active duty Marine and serving in the Middle East right now, just knowing that we should honor veterans every day but Rolling Thunder is special because we honor our fallen. Thereâ€™s so many. The ride was instituted to honor the missing in action and POWs, so itâ€™s special in that way. They started it with only 2, 500 motorcycles 30 years ago, and so this was the 30th anniversary â€”  I was the only member of Congress there. Tenney â€”  a strong conservative woman who started her political career fighting both the GOP establishment and the Democrats in the New York State Assembly before taking the fight to Washington â€”  remarked that there were so many Marines in D. C. for the ride it was â€œamazing. â€ Tenney is emerging as one of the strongest conservative women voices in Washington, speaking truth to power on both sides of the political aisle. She cut her teeth in politics working on key issues like immigration and trade policy in New York â€”  the issues that led to Trumpâ€™s political triumph nationally â€”  and has in the Congress stepped into the role of champion for the American worker. Tenney said: One of the things I thought was remarkable was how many Marines were out there. I texted my son in Kuwait and I said â€˜there are so many Marines out hereâ€™ and he said â€˜Marines and motorcycles: they go together.â€™ It was funny because there were just Marines everywhere and I used to be the lawyer for the Marine Corps in our area and I just know a lot because of my sonâ€™s affiliation with the Marine Corps, I end up doing a lot of their balls and events, and we have a Marine outreach center that we take care of.  Support for the president, Donald J. Trump, ran high among the bikers and veterans in D. C. fo Memorial Day, too. In the words of Claudia Tenney: There were a lot of veterans for Trump and the fact that Trump is so   is refreshing. He gave the military increases and we put through a bill that reduces the wait time and facilitates faster appeals at the VA â€”  thereâ€™s a lot thatâ€™s been done thatâ€™s been pushed through for the president on our side and is maybe waiting in the Senate, some of it. Just having the Secretary there â€”  they all wanted Trump to be there because I guess he was there last year â€”  but it was really moving. The number of people on the street was just astounding to me, just the spectators. And it started to rain also. There were people everywhere, wall to wall people the whole ride â€”  and so many motorcycles. I donâ€™t know how many they estimated. About Trump, she quoted Tillerson : â€œItâ€™s amazing the person you talk to one on one and work with and then the person whoâ€™s out in front of a hundred thousand people. Heâ€™s just a really good listener, really generous and very kind person when youâ€™re one on one with him. â€ Tenney also said she was pleased to see so many Gold Star families: The Gold Star families were some of the most important people represented. They were there, some of the Gold Star mothers from my district were there who Iâ€™ve known for years back to my time in the state assembly. Just about everybody had an American flag, and no problems supporting the American flag and the troops and freedom and Second Amendment rights and all those things. It was very interesting times, and very emotional. Theyâ€™re people who believe in our Constitution, in freedom, and here they are in a massive group supporting our military. I didnâ€™t see any protesters there â€”  I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because motorcycles are viewed as ridden by people who are pretty badass. I couldnâ€™t believe the number of people. They said there were three full lots in the Pentagon â€”  it was just jammed with motorcycle after motorcycle, patriotic people who care about our veterans and care about our country. That was really moving. And the fact that Rex Tillerson, or   or whatever they call him, he was just out there like any other person meeting folks, shaking hands, getting his picture taken with everyone, really down to earth, really gracious, and I was just really impressed. She also said the Marines and veterans and military families loved Secretary of Defense James â€œMad Dogâ€ Mattis when he spoke at Arlington National Cemetery before President Trump on Memorial Day. Tenney said: The next day, people loved Mattis too. Marines love Mattis, Mattis is like a hero to the Marine Corps. I thought Mattis did a great speech and I thought Trumpâ€™s speech was great, recognizing the Gold Star families â€”  thatâ€™s what this is about â€”  was really great. I thought the speech was really well written, and I know he likes to ad lib a little bit and he did a little but not too much. I thought it was really in line with the Rolling Thunder folks. I bet Trump would have loved to have been down at the Rolling Thunder. Tenney, a lifelong motorcycle enthusiast, noted too how she loves to ride her motorcycle around her district to see all the highways and bridges named after veterans and those who have given the ultimate sacrifice serving their country.  â€œI love to ride. Itâ€™s really relaxing,â€ Tenney said. â€œIt gets me away. I like to just go off into the wilderness. Thereâ€™s no phone. Just relax. Itâ€™s actually a sport for a type A personality like me because you have to be careful and you have to pay attention. I used to ride horses too when I was younger, so itâ€™s similar. â€"

From CNNâ€™s post : Itâ€™s time for a new rule on the web: Double, no, triple check before you share. Especially if it seems too good to be true. 
Why? Look no further than Donald Trumpâ€™s Twitter account. Trump claimed Sunday morning that â€œTwitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.â€ 
Not only was there no proof of this, but it was pretty easy to disprove. The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News; FBI director James Comeyâ€™s name was at the top of Facebookâ€™s â€œtrendingâ€ box; and Twitterâ€™s â€œmomentsâ€ section had a prominent story about the controversy . (I guess Iâ€™ll have to take their word for it. I donâ€™t use Google nor Facebook. As for Twitter, well, just ask Jack .) You can trust Facebookâ€¦ 
Nevertheless, Trumpâ€™s wrong-headed â€œburyingâ€ claim was his most popular tweet of the day. About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 â€œlikedâ€ it, helping the falsehood spread far and wide. 
The rise of social media has had many upsides, but one downside has been the spread of misinformation. Fake news has become a plague on the Web, especially on social networks like Facebook. As I said on Sundayâ€™s â€œReliable Sourcesâ€ on CNN, unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count. 
So thatâ€™s what I recommended a â€œtriple check before you shareâ€ rule. 
New web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day. For their creators, the incentives are clear: more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars. 
But the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again. Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth. The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition. 
A recent BuzzFeed study of â€œhyperpartisan Facebook pagesâ€ found that these pages â€œare consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.â€ (There you have it. From the expert journalism of â€œBuzzFeed.â€) 
The less truthful the content, the more frequently it was shared â€” which does not bode well for the nationâ€™s news literacy during a long, bitter election season. â€œRight-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,â€ the BuzzFeed reporting team said. 
On a few occasions, made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebookâ€™s â€œtrendingâ€ box â€” a problem that the company says it is trying to address. 
In a few cases, Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories, including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined â€œDonald Trump Protester Speaks Out: â€˜I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trumpâ€™s Rally.'â€ 
A close look at the web site reveals that it is not, in fact, the actual ABC News. But the site tricked Trumpâ€™s son Eric Trump in early October. â€œFinally, the truth comes out,â€ he tweeted, promoting a link to the bogus story. 
As soon as I spoke about this on television on Sunday, CNN detractors filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of â€œfake news.â€ But thatâ€™s a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue. Whatever faults CNN has, news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth. 
Fake news sites and Facebook feeds, on the other hand, traffic in misinformation. My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites: 
#1, Hoax sites with totally made-up news headlines that try to trick you; 
#2, Hyperpartisan sites that arenâ€™t lying, per se, but are misleading, because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party; 
#3, â€œHybridsâ€ that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction. 
These sites arenâ€™t going away, so itâ€™s up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it. Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help â€” they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks. Josh Stearns from Democracy Fund 
Josh Stearns, a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund, said newsrooms also have a role to play. 
â€œFact checking has taken center stage in this election, but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too,â€ he told me. â€œAt a time when trust in media is at an all time low, journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction.â€ 
Trumpâ€™s false claim about Google, Facebook and Twitter â€œburyingâ€ bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the â€œvery dishonest media.â€ Ironically, he was using Twitter to blast Twitter. 
Trump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a â€œsocial media blackout.â€ The blog post contained false information. I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim, but no one has responded.

21103,"Obama's DOJ Issued ""Stand Down"" Order on Clinton Foundation Investigation",Daniel Greenfield,"Obama's DOJ Issued ""Stand Down"" Order on Clinton Foundation Investigation November 3, 2016 
There have been various insider reports on the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary email scandal on FOX. 
But the curious thing about this Wall Street Journal report is that it's clearly aimed at defending Hillary Clinton and smearing the FBI in the battle with Obama's DOJ officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of Hillary Clinton. 
Which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility. 
Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. 
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to â€œstand down,â€™â€™ a person familiar with the matter said. 
A stand down order. Much like the one in Libya. 
And remember McCabe, whose wife's Democratic political campaign received major cash from a Clinton ally? 
Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBIâ€™s No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. 
Not a surprise either. 
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldnâ€™t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. 
FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. 
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnâ€™t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. 
And that's what blew up when Team Hillary lashed out at the FBI. It was a covert war between Hillary's DOJ allies and the FBI coming out of the cold. And they pushed so hard even McCabe was disgusted. 
As a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, â€œAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?â€™â€™ The senior Justice Department official replied: â€Of course not.â€ 
Of course."
21105,"Refugee Arrivals Decline Sharply under Trump, Says Report",Bob Price,"A new report reveals the number of refugees resettled monthly in 46 U. S. states declined sharply in Fiscal Year 2017. Refugee resettlement dropped abruptly following President Donald Trumpâ€™s January inauguration. The drop is most pronounced in Texas and California. [The nonpartisan Pew Research Center reviewed data from the U. S. State Department and reported Thursday that the numbers of refugees resettling in the U. S. had dropped nationwide from 9, 945 in October 2016 to 3, 316 in April 2017.  Besides Texas and California in the first and second spots, Michigan and New York have also seen marked decreases. These states were followed by Arizona, Washington, Ohio, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. California, Texas, and New York were three of the 10 states that resettled the most refugees in the fiscal year 2016, and they have seen the biggest drop. Texas experienced a 68 percent reduction in the number of refugees received. That number in California was 58 percent. Michigan and New York saw a 70 and 68 percent cut respectively from October to April.  Although there was an abatement during this   period, the number of refugees that arrived in April rose 60 percent to 3, 315 when compared to the 2, 070 in March.  Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch appeared skeptical of the reportâ€™s true meaning. She noted the decline is from a historical peak under the Obama Administration and said October was the â€œlargest month (by far) of any fiscal year in the past 11. â€ â€œI also had a chuckle as I read the Pew story about how the numbers are plummeting in Texas, but not a mention that the state withdrew from the program and that although it is up and running now (without the state government) the transition to the   program did cause a slight slowdown,â€ Corcoran wrote in a post on Refugee Resettlement Watchâ€™s website. â€œTexas is still the number 2 state behind California for refugee admissions this year. â€ President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13780 on March 6 capping the number of refugees coming into the U. S. at 50, 000. The Obama Administration had set that number at 110, 000. The March executive order revoked and replaced the original order issued on January 27 which was signed by the president just seven days after he was sworn into office. As reported by Breitbart News, the new order was designed to also temporarily block migrants from six   countries and to freeze arrivals for 120 days. Corcoran noted that had the Presidentâ€™s order been allowed to stand, â€œThat would have caused â€˜plummetingâ€™ admission numbers. â€ She reported the federal government is on pace to admit approximately 60, 000 refugees this fiscal year. â€œCompare that to Bush in 2007 and Obama in 2011 and 2012  â€”   all three years under 60, 000,â€ she concluded. On Thursday, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sitting en banc issued an opinion and upheld a block from a federal district court in Maryland against the executive order. Three of the judges dissented. Judge Paul Niemeyer chastised the majority for impermissibly expanding its review from the text of the executive order itself, Breitbart News reported. Niemeyer stated the U. S. Supreme Court has prohibited such appellate review, and the intermediate appellate court looked to statements made by presidential candidate Donald Trump and other â€œextratextual search for evidence suggesting bad faith, which is exactly what three Supreme Court opinions have prohibited. â€ Judge Niemeyer wrote, â€œThe majority, now for the first time, rejects these holdings in favor of its politically desired outcome. The Pew report from Thursday noted, â€œIf the new ceiling were in place, the U. S. could resettle a maximum of 7, 586 refugees during the final five months of the current fiscal year, which ends in September. â€ The report by the Pew Research Center released on May 25 ends with the statement: For U. S. resettlement, the International Organization for Migration and the U. S. Office of Refugee Resettlement work with voluntary agencies such as the International Rescue Committee or Church World Service to resettle refugees. These agencies have offices across the country and resettle refugees across many states. After 90 to 180 days, financial assistance from federal agencies stops. Breitbart News reported in February that U. S. taxpayers would expend more than $4. 1 billion in the 2017 budget to support the 519, 018 refugees resettled in the country since October 2009.

21108,â€™The Next Revolution? Steve Hilton is the Original RINOâ€™,Oliver JJ Lane,"The chairman of Britainâ€™s oldest conservative think tank has slammed political strategist turned media pundit Steve Hilton for portraying himself as a Tea Party style   figure, accusing him of being a liberal â€œmoderniserâ€ and RINO (Republican in name only). [Speaking to Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily, Bow Group Chairman Ben   said Fox Newsâ€™s new anchor Steve Hilton and his show The Next Revolution, with its focus on â€œhow corrupt the establishment isâ€ was far from a friend of the people.  Explaining how Hilton has contributed to the collapse of Conservative grassroots in the United Kingdom before jumping ship to the U. S. to become a media pundit,   said of Hilton and his long association with Britainâ€™s former prime minister: Steve Hilton was really the original moderniser in the Conservative party  â€¦     the original RINO. He worked with David Cameron going back 20, 25 years  â€¦     came up with him through the ranks of the Conservative party. Their whole basis was to move the Conservative Party leftwards to the centre, to ape what [Labour Party Prime Minister] Tony Blair had done in British politics. It is extraordinary to now see him almost placing himself with the Tea Party movement in the United States. Listing the disastrous and unconservative policies pushed by Hilton in the UK, Kassam said: â€œLet us not forget this man is somebody who was behind implementing the â€˜big greenâ€™ agenda in the United Kingdom, he was behind telling Conservative Members of Parliament that they could no longer espouse conservative views and that they had to hide behind these liberal left approaches to things. His big flagship policy was what they called the â€˜big societyâ€™ which really meant big government, and using fluffy   words to implement it. â€ Both Bow Group Chairman   and Breitbart host Kassam agreed they were glad Hilton had suddenly performed a   and decided his decades of progressive politicking was a mistake as he looked to populism for a new career, but they also said it was time to hear him admit he had been wrong.   said: â€œEveryone can change their views in politics, everyone can change their opinions. But what Iâ€™d like to hear from Steve Hilton is an address as to how he was wrong and why we were right. How did he change his views and why?â€ Kassam went further, demanding Hilton apologise to the public for the damage he had done. He said: â€œIâ€™d like to have him look squarely down that Fox News camera and say: â€˜Iâ€™m sorry for ruining the United Kingdom, Iâ€™m sorry for ruining the Conservative Party  â€¦     Iâ€™m sorry for continuing the legacy of Tony Blair  â€¦     I see one of my fellow countrymen masquerading as something that for so many years he was against. He was ridiculing us, he was mocking us. â€™â€   remarked in reply that not only had Hilton and his fellow travellers damaged conservatism in Britain, they had also attacked those who sought to defend the old principles of the movement, including his own think tank which had been known as a favourite of former Prime Minister Baroness Margaret Thatcher. Explaining how that damage led to the disastrous result for the Conservative Party in last weekâ€™s general election,   remarked: They took a very uncompromising attitude towards those who continued to defend   conservatism. David Cameron personally tried to wipe both myself and the Bow Group out, and what happened with Steve Hilton and David Cameron was to totally disempower the grassroots membership, who tended to stick to traditional conservative values. All of that has actually led to the general election we just saw because the Conservative Party now has one sixth of the membership of the Labour Party because everyone got extremely annoyed that the leadership of the party held the membership in contempt, and left. That legacy is still having a major effect on British politics. Iâ€™m glad Steve Hilton has admitted heâ€™s wrong, but he seems to want to rewrite that history. Steve Hilton worked with the Conservative Party on their failed 1997 general election campaign before becoming the director of strategy  â€”   known as the â€œ  manâ€  â€”   to former British Prime Minister David Cameron, resigning in 2012.

21109,The Mysterious Metamorphosis of Chuck Close - The New York Times,Wil S. Hylton,"A couple of weeks ago, I went to visit Chuck Close at his beach house on Long Island. The drive there always reminds me of an escape to the Hamptons in reverse. From the aristocratic brownstones of Park Slope, you work your way steadily down the socioeconomic ladder, past the towering   style apartment complexes of Coney Island, through strips of pawn shops and gimcrack hotels that give way to rowhouses fronted with plaster statuary, until at last the journey comes to an end at the   beaten waterfront of Long Beach, a haven for cops and firefighters looking to blow off summer steam, where you pay for access to the sand amid a throng of rented umbrellas and   engorged pectorals, all of which vanish at sundown into a surfeit of   bwomping nightclubs along the strip. If all this sounds like an odd place to find one of the worldâ€™s most celebrated painters, a master of the modern portrait whose work is displayed in the great museums, all I can tell you is that pretty much every close friend and relative of Closeâ€™s feels the same way. After 30 years of splitting his time between the tony enclaves of Manhattan and Bridgehampton, he has recently set about leaving much of his old life behind: filing for divorce from his wife, Leslie, after 43 years of marriage, disappearing for the winter to live virtually alone in a new apartment on Miami Beach and retreating from his summer friends to the crowded isolation of Long Beach. Even when Close ventures into the city for a gallery opening these days, he will often turn up in some outlandish costume, in fabrics printed with giant starfish and sunflowers, with lipstick smeared across his face and billowing, extravagant scarves. Over the past year, I have been stopping off to see Close in various homes and apartments up and down the Eastern Seaboard, trying to get a handle on the changes in his life and their connection to his work. On my most recent visit to his beach house, I arrived a few minutes early, and one of his assistants let me in, gesturing toward a staircase that leads to his bedroom and studio. I found Close waiting at the top with a gentle smile. At 76, it must be said, he is starting to look  . Apart from the obvious fact of his being restricted to a wheelchair since 1988, when an arterial collapse left him mostly paralyzed from the neck down, he is also entering that awkward phase in life when bodies degenerate unevenly, so that even as heâ€™s become a little corpulent at the middle, his cheeks are starting to hollow out and his powerful neck to narrow, giving the impression that his shiny bald head and tufted white goatee are elongating with time. What hasnâ€™t changed, and mercifully so, is that smile. It is the most hopeful, eager, childlike smile a person can imagine. It would not be going too far to say that it can fill and break your heart at once. Another element of lingering beauty about him is the contour of his wrists and hands. Thirty years of muscular atrophy have left them as stretched and sinewy as fine silverwork, and with only the slightest motor control, he tends to hold them perfectly flat, gesturing this way and that with all five fingers at once. The effect is vaguely regal. When he needs to pick something up, he will pinch it between the outer edges of his palms, which gives the impression of a man cupping water from a stream. On this particular morning, he wore a   splattered smock over a white   and blue pants, swishing a small glass of cappuccino with both hands. After a quick hug and hello, we went outside to a balcony overlooking the water. The morning sun raked over the dune grass, and the beach was just filling with tourists. Close leaned back in his chair to let the light pour onto his face. He looked tan and rested, healthier than Iâ€™d seen him in months, and had been working all morning in the studio behind us on a large   portrait that I knew he was excited about. â€œI always have at least one   portrait in each show,â€ he said, â€œbut usually no more than one. And then, with the last show, there were a lot of   portraits, and Iâ€™ve only done   portraits since then. I think Iâ€™m having a conversation with myself. â€ He continued: â€œFacing death, or whatever the hell it is. I think it comes out of my diagnosis and not knowing how long I have. â€ What you need to understand as we get into this further is that nobody saw it coming. I donâ€™t just mean his recent focus on death or his urge toward   portraiture, nor do I mean his bewildering decision to remove himself to Long Beach and Miami, or even the trail of late nights and young women he has begun to leave behind. What I mean is the combination of all these things into a period of metamorphic transition here at the end of a legendary life. I think now of an afternoon we spent together three years back. Maybe the signal was already there. It is so hard to know. This was at his studio on Bond Street. It looked about the same as now: fading black facade of peeling paint, windows papered over, without a sign or even a doorbell to announce the light within  â€”   and behind that leaden barrier: him, whirling about in his mechanical chair, his body slumped low in the seat, his chin thrust high as he scrambled to complete the dayâ€™s work. There was an old television set in the corner, blaring chatty daytime garbage, and the floor was specked with bits of paint under a bank of skylights, with large photographs of Barack Obama propped against one wall and, at the far end of the room, atop an aluminum easel, an incomplete portrait of the artist Cindy Sherman  â€”   eight feet high and wrought in a palette that dissolved from creamy greens and grays into a riot of hot pink at the bottom. At the time, I thought little of this shift on the canvas, or what it might portend. The intrusion of pink at the lower edge was unlike anything Iâ€™d seen him paint before. It seemed lurid and garish, not at all to my taste, but it was, after all, an incomplete work, and he was Chuck Close. He was Chuck Close. Fifty years of paint on canvas, and if there was anything you came to expect, it was the eccentricity of his vision. He arrived in New York in the 1960s from about as great a distance as any American kid could. Raised in Everett, Wash. on the Puget Sound, he was a tall and stocky child but oddly vulnerable, forever wrestling some new illness  â€”   a neuromuscular condition that made it difficult to lift his feet, a bout with nephritis that kept him   bound for most of sixth grade. When he did attend school, he was a lumbering student who struggled to read and write. Later he would understand these limitations as dyslexia, but in the 1950s, as he told me once, â€œyou werenâ€™t dyslexic, you were stupid. â€ Year by year, he slipped by, mustering what skills he possessed: He would entertain his family with magic tricks, dressed in vaudevillian garb, and when his teachers assigned a paper on the travels of Lewis and Clark, he drew an expansive map of the expedition instead. Afternoons he often spent in silence at his grandmotherâ€™s house next door, watching as she knit stars to sew together into a tablecloth. He had always known he wanted to be an artist, but it was difficult to define precisely what that meant. After high school, he commuted to art classes at Everett Junior College, then transferred to the University of Washington and completed a masterâ€™s at Yale. By the time he reached Manhattan in his 20s, he may have appeared, at    with a beaming grin and a gravelly baritone, the picture of robust confidence, but the picture belied his childhood struggles and insular experience of life. What he knew was that he possessed a gift for portraiture so lifelike that it seemed like malpractice not to express it. Take a look at the early stuff, just after his arrival in the city. Start with â€œNancyâ€ from 1968 or â€œPhilâ€ from â€™69. Youâ€™re looking at   portraits so   precise that they actually read as    photographs. In fact, if youâ€™re looking at reproductions of the work, itâ€™s difficult to know whether you are seeing a photograph of his painting or the photo on which his painting was based. The detail is mathematical, mechanical, which is not to say rote. Nothing irritates Close more than referring to his early portraiture as â€œphotorealism,â€ but setting aside the   historical baggage of that term, itâ€™s a pretty good description of what you see. Even as you slip forward a few years and he begins adding color in the early 1970s, youâ€™ll find no painterly style on the canvas, no distinctive brushwork  â€”   namely because he had given up brushes to work with a paint sprayer, which he considered a homage to Vermeer. â€œI can figure out how any painting in the history of art got made, with the exception of Vermeerâ€™s,â€ he told me. â€œItâ€™s like a divine wind blew the pigment on. â€ What you get in those early portraits, then, are paintings in which the viewerâ€™s attention is directed not to the hand of the artist or the texture of the paint, but to the faces themselves  â€”   trying to divine, in those   expressions, a crumb of attitude or emotion. That is to say, your imagination is drawn to the subject of the work, not the object. Remember that Close was making these portraits at a time of spectacular upheaval in American art, when many of his contemporaries were preoccupied with wild, experimental work  â€”   with artists like Walter de Maria, Michael Heizer and Robert Smithson moving into the desert, where they would trap lightning, build a   city of black stone and extend a huge spiral walkway into the Great Salt Lake. Just a few years earlier, the prominent critic Clement Greenberg effectively banished the kind of work that Close was doing from the ranks of modern art. â€œWith an advanced artist,â€ Greenberg wrote, â€œitâ€™s now not possible to make a portrait. â€ So in the world that Close inhabited, his work presented a strange duality. In one sense, the decision to paint photographic portraiture was almost laughably conventional. In another, it was among the most defiant things a downtown artist could do, or anyway, the thing most likely to catch hell on a Saturday night, when you could find Close a few blocks north of his studio at the bar Maxâ€™s Kansas City, surrounded by artistic insurgents like Richard Serra and Dorothea Rockburne and struggling to defend his work against the impression that it wasnâ€™t really art at all  â€”   or as Close grumpily described the dynamic to me, â€œLike I might as well have been a prostitute inviting people up to my room to screw me. â€ One of the things you hear people say about Close now, with the supposed benefit of hindsight, is that the medical catastrophe he suffered in 1988, which took his mobility and nearly killed him, also revolutionized his work. The nightmare crashed down on a warm Wednesday afternoon in December. He was attending an awards ceremony for artists at Gracie Mansion when a flattening exhaustion swept through him and he stumbled outside, tripping down the street to Doctors Hospital, where he collapsed inside the doorway and, within an hour, lay paralyzed from the neck down. But losing control of his hands, the story goes, forced him to abandon the conventions of realism and develop a novel way of painting: dividing his canvas into a grid and then filling one square at a time to create a dynamic   pointillist effect. This is a tidy,   wrapped narrative, which should be the first indication that itâ€™s wrong. Something about Close seems to invite this sort of   psych exegesis. The other great yarn that circulates about his work involves the medical condition prosopagnosia, which is commonly known as â€œ  blindness. â€ Because Close has difficulty remembering new people and believes that he suffers from the condition, the temptation has proved irresistible for his fans and critics to draw a link between prosopagnosia and his interest in painting faces. Which makes for a charming story and might be true, but the evidence is pretty shaky. Some of Closeâ€™s oldest friends have told me that they never heard him mention   blindness until he reached an age when forgetting people is common, and anyway, he tends to paint the same familiar people repeatedly  â€”   like his   Leslie, and his daughters, Maggie and Georgia, and his pals Cindy Sherman and Philip Glass  â€”   so itâ€™s not clear in what sense you could argue that heâ€™s using the work to navigate an unfamiliar landscape. The evidence that quadriplegia revitalized his work is even more slender. You can look pretty closely at the paintings just before his collapse and the ones right after, and at some point youâ€™ve got to admit thereâ€™s hardly any difference at all. The truth is that by the time of the collapse, he had been experimenting with grids and fragmented portraiture for more than a decade. Even as his realistic portraits garnered acclaim, selected for shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Biennial, and Close himself gravitated to the center of the New York art scene, he was also, in the relative privacy of his studio, tinkering with the very qualities he was becoming known for. Not to say that the medical catastrophe was anything short of terrorizing for Close, transforming every other aspect of his life, just weirdly, almost providentially, not so much the work. Examples. A few months before the collapse, Close opened a show at the Pace Gallery in Manhattan, where he included the paintings â€œCindy IIâ€ and â€œFrancesco II,â€ each composed with thousands of irregular dots the next year, fresh out of the hospital and eager to return to work, he strapped a paintbrush to his failing wrist and completed â€œJanetâ€ and â€œElizabeth. â€ Anyone who looks at these four paintings and claims to discern a   after split is talking stuff. Or better yet, compare the paintings â€œAlex IIâ€ and â€œLucas II,â€ which you can see above. One was completed in the year before his collapse and the other the year after  â€”   but without the captions, it would be hard to say which is which. Whatâ€™s startling about this emerging style, particularly as it evolved into the formal structure of the grid, is that it doesnâ€™t just approximate the suggestion of a human face. From a distance, the squares of the grid actually cohere into a portrait thatâ€™s nearly as vivid, in its way, as his early photorealist work. Looking at a painting like â€œLyle,â€ you see minute shades of detail: a gentle furrow in the brow, a wrinkle of amusement at the corner of the eye. This impression of detail, where no actual detail can be found on the canvas, is mesmerizing and confounding. What you are seeing isnâ€™t really there. You are no longer looking at the actual surface of the painting, but some apparition hovering above it, a numinous specter that arises in part from the engagement of your own imagination. Through the painting, Close has accessed the perceptual center of your mind, exploiting the way we process human identity: the gaps of knowledge and the unknown spaces we fill with our own presumptions, the expectations and delusions we layer upon everyone we meet. Which is why, by the time I made my way out to see the new house in Long Beach for the first time last year, I had come to think of Close not merely as a painter of enormous faces but as someone engaged in thinking about the fragile boundary between identity and perception. So when I entered his studio on a sweltering afternoon last summer and discovered, mounted upon the easel, a looming   portrait in glaring neon, utterly devoid of depth or detail, as if he had taken the pink bottom of that Cindy Sherman portrait from a few years earlier and, rather than complete the painting, embraced its crude quality as a new technique, I couldnâ€™t help wondering what Close, after 50 years of struggling to capture the human face and human identity, was trying now, at the end of his life, to reveal about his own. By this time, it was clear to everyone around Close that something unusual was going on with him. The mystery was what. With each passing season, he seemed to grow more distant, disappearing to Miami and Long Beach, where few of his friends had gone to visit or even knew where to find him. This was the backdrop against which I drove out to see him that day last summer. I arrived just as he was finishing a daily medical ablution and found myself waiting in his studio, gawping at the new   portrait in all its coruscant color. Itâ€™s difficult to know how to describe that painting, or the series of new work it was part of, except to say that it was a radical departure from the last 20 years of his art. Gone were all the swoops and swirls that he typically paints into each square of the grid. In their place, he had filled each cell with just one or two predominant colors, creating a clunky digital effect like the graphics of a Commodore 64. The colors themselves were harsh and glaring, blinding pink and gleaming blue, while the face in the portrait  â€”   his face  â€”   was cleaved right down the middle, with one side of the canvas painted in different shades from the other. To the left, his skin was peach, his shirt deep red and the background mint green to the right, his skin was pink, his shirt sapphire and the backdrop orange. There was a   splotch hovering over his neck, with a long tail that poked into his nose, and one ear was radioactive yellow the nose was honking blue. As I stood there puzzling over the painting, I heard the elevator in the hallway clatter to a stop, and Close wheeled into the room behind me. He was wearing a pair of huge turquoise eye glasses, a dark blue smock and not much in the way of pants, just his bare legs sticking out from the wheelchair and wrapped in white compression socks. He smiled and, gesturing toward the canvas, said: â€œItâ€™s almost, what?   like?â€ The painting did not strike me as   like by any divination, but rather than say so, I blurted out, â€œInteresting that itâ€™s halved. â€ Close pursed his lips, and we continued staring at the image in silence. Light poured through the windows and skylights, and the sound of the beach blew through the room in gusts of chatter. After a while, I pulled a heavy wooden chair from the side of the room to the middle, taking a seat beside him. â€œSo,â€ I said. â€œTell me how youâ€™ve made this place into a home. â€ A tiny frown flashed over his face as if he were making some private calculation, then he shrugged and proceeded to answer the question I hadnâ€™t asked. â€œI got to the point where I felt it was no longer my art world,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s not a lot of interest in painting. â€ By this, I gathered that he meant the renewed emphasis on conceptual art in certain quarters, with its preference for cultural commentary over the old tradition of artistic making. â€œThe dirtiest word in art is the â€ Close said. â€œI canâ€™t even say â€˜craftâ€™ without feeling dirty. â€ He attributed this change in part to the economic eruption of modern New York. â€œI blame whatâ€™s happened in art on how expensive it became to be an artist,â€ he said. â€œWhen I came to New York in â€™67, a     foot studio was $85. â€ Without access to such large private studios, he said, many young artists have developed alternate ways of working, like drawing plans for an installation or a sculpture they hope to make but not actually producing the work until it has been selected for a show. â€œItâ€™s   studio art!â€ he said. â€œSculptors who never see the work before the exhibition. Itâ€™s designed on the back of a cocktail napkin at 35, 000 feet, and then they build it for the first time in Germany. â€ For an artist who learns to work this way, he added, a studio can become unnecessary, even when one is available. â€œIâ€™ve been involved for many years with the American Academy in Rome, the most beautiful studios that anybody will ever be offered, and depending whoâ€™s on the jury, some years there wonâ€™t be a single person who makes anything,â€ he said. â€œThey sit in these beautiful studios, they put the work on the wall that they used to get the grant and then they just talk. For a year. Itâ€™s criminal. You can talk in any room! Those rooms should be used to make paintings or sculpture. And then out of this   studio thing came the absolute scariest notion of all, which is   skilled art. Have you heard that?   skilled! Itâ€™s like  â€”   whatever you do, donâ€™t show them you have any facility!â€ Close mentioned that after his collapse in 1988, he briefly considered shifting to conceptual work himself. â€œIâ€™m lying in bed, paralyzed  â€”   now what am I going to do?â€ he said. â€œI thought: I can make work of a conceptual nature. I can put a level on a shelf as well as someone else! But I was going to miss the activity of pushing paint around. So pretty soon, I thought, Iâ€™m going to get the paint on the canvas if I have to spit the paint on the canvas. They found me a room in the basement, an   therapy room. It was so depressing: unfinished baskets hanging from the ceiling, because the person died before they finished the basket, or they gave them   burning. . .. â€ His voice trailed off, and he paused for a moment. â€œYouâ€™re paralyzed, doing   burning?â€ he said quietly. Then he paused again, and a look of confusion came over him. â€œWhy am I talking about this?â€ he asked. â€œYou were talking about the therapeutic role of process,â€ I said. â€œRight,â€ he said, and resumed the story. But a minute later, he lost his train of thought once more. Then another few minutes passed, and it happened again. After half a dozen of these, I suggested we take a break. I was staying in the area for a few days, so it would be easy to return, and we agreed to meet the following afternoon for lunch. I gathered my things and wandered outside to the boardwalk. Toned young couples raced by on Rollerblades, and the shouts of children echoed over the water, and I found myself shuffling through the crowd in a state of bewilderment. I had no idea what to make of the strange forgetfulness that came over Close, or his new style of painting, or whatever had led him to Long Beach, but it seemed to me as I traipsed the boardwalk that I could really only hope to connect with the work through the man. I was reminded of a night a few months earlier, when I was living at an artist colony in upstate New York and attended an evening exhibition of another residentâ€™s work. He was a videographer with a lively sense of humor, and Iâ€™d come to enjoy our conversations, but it turned out that he spent his artistic energy shooting footage of himself breaking dinnerware. I mean this literally: His show that evening consisted of more than an hour of film that depicted saucers and cups flying through the air and smashing. As I watched this, I confess, I found little to admire in it, but I was increasingly curious about what in the world inspired him to make it. It seems to me now, with greater reflection, that the value of experiencing another personâ€™s art is not merely the work itself, but the opportunity it presents to connect with the interior impulse of another. The arts occupy a vanishing space in modern life: They offer one of the last lingering places to seek out empathy for its own sake, and to the extent that an artistâ€™s work is frustrating or difficult or awful, you could say this allows greater opportunity to try to meet it. I am not saying there is no room for discriminating taste and judgment, just that there is also, I think, this other portal through which to experience creative work and to access a different kind of beauty, which might be called communion. In any event, as I passed through the clamor of the boardwalk that afternoon, I wasnâ€™t sure how I felt about the new painting, but I was eager to understand what it meant to Close. Removed from his old friends and landscapes, feeling alienated from the New York art world and disconcerted by its inclinations, he was working in this divergent new mode, in a blaring slate of colors, and was painting precisely what he wanted to paint, because he wanted to paint it. In that sense, if no other, it was dazzling to consider the   portrait and to witness the audacity of an artist working so independently at the end. I thought of the critic William Hazlittâ€™s fascination, in the early 1800s, with what he called â€œthe old age of artists,â€ about which he wrote, â€œOne feels that they are not quite mortal, that they have one imperishable part about them. â€ I was also reminded of the long ruminations by Edward Said on the same phenomenon, which Theodor Adorno termed â€œlate style,â€ when an artist approaching the end of life begins to embrace a newfound dissonance. â€œEach of us can supply evidence of late works which crown a lifetime of aesthetic endeavor,â€ Said wrote. â€œBut what of artistic lateness not as harmony and resolution, but as intransigence, difficulty and contradiction?â€ Thinking of a musician like Beethoven, Said wrote: â€œLate works constitute a form of exile. â€ In Long Beach, exile had the sound of summer, and I spent a few more days with Close, watching the tides roll out. We would sit at the long table on the middle floor, eating Indian takeout and discussing the commercial compromise made by artists who rely on assistants to make their work. â€œI look at my friend Jeff Koons, and I think, Why in Godâ€™s name does he want to do that?â€ Close said. â€œWhy would he give up the fun part to become the C. E. O. of an   manufacturing company?â€ We drank whiskey overlooking the beach, talking about his relationship with his daughters. â€œIâ€™ve been in a struggle with my children to see which of us was going to be a   first, and they won,â€ he said. â€œI still live entirely in the moment. I donâ€™t think about the past. It drives the people around me crazy. â€ Then suddenly, in the middle of some wandering thought, often in midsentence, he would stop, and it was clear that he no longer knew where his own voice had taken him. In moments of pique and humor, he   talked the critics who savaged his early work. â€œWhen Hilton Kramer was the critic at The Times, he reviewed my first big show,â€ he said. â€œHe took half a page to say how awful it was, and I still remember the quote. He said, What Mr. Close makes is evidence of the kind of crap that washed ashore when the tide of Pop Art went out. Isnâ€™t that great? !â€ â€œItâ€™s brutal,â€ I said. â€œItâ€™s great,â€ he said again. â€œIf Hilton Kramer liked my work, Iâ€™d slit my wrists. John Canaday hated me, too. Deborah Solomon doesnâ€™t speak to me anymore, because I was at a cocktail party and sheâ€™d just written a profile of someone that was so nasty, and I said: I donâ€™t know how you live with yourself. Itâ€™s like being a meter maid  â€”   all you do is bring people misery. â€ He talked about his   affinity for younger women. â€œIt turns out that a wheelchair is some sort of funny babe magnet,â€ he said. â€œWhen Iâ€™m going through the Miami Art Fair, thousands of beautiful women are hanging all over me. â€ I mentioned that this seemed to trouble his   and daughters, with whom I was in contact. â€œThey worry whether people are taking advantage of you,â€ I said. â€œThey do nothing to keep informed,â€ he said quickly. â€œI would be happy to let them know. â€ At one point, we slipped out of the house, away from his medical staff, whose constant presence can be overwhelming, and we raced down the street with the jittering energy of a slapstick jailbreak, Close barreling over curbs and around corners, his wheelchair canting to the edge of toppling, while I loped along, trying to keep up, and we settled for lunch at the sidewalk table of a Mexican restaurant, where we fed each other forkfuls of fish tacos, empanadas and arepas. During this time, several things became clear to me, and others more confusing. For example, I learned  â€”   at first in confidence and then with permission to tell you here  â€”   that early last year, Close received a mistaken diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and that he spent weeks in a panic over the implications, expecting to have only one or two more years of life and believing that his new phase of work would be his last. A few weeks after he told me this, we had lunch at his usual table in the Manhattan restaurant Il Buco, and I asked him how to handle the misdiagnosis in print. Close leaned back in his chair and studied the ceiling for a moment. â€œJust say that I was diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s,â€ he said, â€œand it turned out to be wrong, but thereâ€™s another diagnosis that I  havenâ€™t made public. â€ What I can tell you about the new diagnosis is that it does not signal imminent demise and that Close today is, as he has been for much of his life, in the grip of an unrelieved cavalcade of physical setbacks, including bedsores and routine catheterization, but none of these things can be made to explain, at least not fully, the rising eccentricity of his manner. Many of the things I learned about Close became apparent in oblique ways. During my first few visits to the beach house, I was under the impression that his second marriage, to the artist Sienna Shields, whom he married in 2013, was still going strong and that any additional flings and forays with other women were simply part of their arrangement. Shields would join us for drinks, chatting amiably about Alaska, her home state, where she and Close were building another house. When Close and I drifted off to chat privately, she spent her time rustling through piles of art supplies and boxes stacked in a room at the western end of the second floor, which she and Close at first explained as having something to do with her changing studios. This seemed a little vague, but I didnâ€™t realize how much they left out until one afternoon, when I arrived for lunch and Shields was gone  â€”   while an even younger woman named Eve was at Closeâ€™s side, joining us at the banquet table, helping Close eat, touching him affectionately and demonstrating with every gesture her position as his girlfriend. I had arrived that day with the founder of the Pace Gallery, Arne Glimcher, whose renown as the director and producer of movies like â€œThe Mambo Kingsâ€ and â€œGorillas in the Mistâ€ may at this point approach Closeâ€™s own. Glimcher is also a serious sailor who was just about to depart for a journey around the easternmost point of the Iberian Peninsula with his wife, Millie. It was clear that he was just as baffled as I was by the sudden appearance of Eve, whom he confessed to having never met, or heard about, on our drive back to Manhattan a few hours later, his driver inching through traffic on the Belt Parkway while Glimcher, in a trim blue blazer festooned with a red lapel pin to denote his selection for the French Legion of Honor, calmly stroked the back of a little gray terrier asleep on his lap. A few weeks later, I ran into Glimcher at a gallery opening downtown. He was just back from the sail, and he grabbed my arm, pulling me into a coat room. â€œSo, itâ€™s official,â€ he said. â€œChuck and Sienna are over. â€ â€œO. K.,â€ I said. â€œHow do you think I should describe the situation with Eve?â€ Glimcher frowned. â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ he said. â€œI guess just say itâ€™s a fact. â€ In between these occasions, I had long and difficult conversations with many people who have been intimate with Close through the years, including both of his daughters, Georgia and Maggie. Although these interviews were on the record, with tape recorders running, each of them later expressed remorse for some of the things they said, and I have chosen to withhold most of what they told me. The takeaway is that Closeâ€™s decision to file for divorce from their mother, Leslie, in 2010, seemed to the children like a precipitating event for many of the changes in his life since then, which at various points each of them referred to as an identity crisis in old age. For Georgia and Maggie, tears came readily, and I would characterize their prevailing sentiment as an amalgam of love, heartbreak and longing. Their fatherâ€™s departure from the family routine and his relocation to, of all places, Long Beach and Miami, left them feeling alienated and displaced. â€œThereâ€™s a social disconnect, an emotional disconnect sometimes,â€ Georgia told me. â€œI donâ€™t think any of us, even in our family really, can put our finger on it. â€ In a conversation with Maggie, she told me: â€œI worry about my dad to the point that itâ€™s debilitating. â€ Awkward in the role of "
21110,Spring Weather? Snowstorm? New York Schools to Close on Thursday - The New York Times,Eli Rosenberg and Christopher Mele,"The   weather in New York City saw a   62 degrees on Wednesday, but a significant snowstorm expected to move in overnight prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to close schools on Thursday. The announcement came after the National Weather Service on Wednesday posted a winter storm warning for the city and a blizzard warning for the eastern part of Long Island. Forecasts called for 8 to 12 inches of snow throughout northern New Jersey, the Hudson Valley, Long Island, coastal Connecticut and the city. The heaviest snow was expected from early Thursday morning through afternoon, with wind gusts up to 35 m. p. h. the service said on its website. Nationwide, airports were reporting more than 2, 800 canceled flights for Thursday, according to FlightAware. com, a   website. Newark Liberty International Airport had 603 canceled flights, La Guardia Airport, 566, and Kennedy International Airport, 480, the website reported on Thursday night. On Wednesday, the temperature reached 62 degrees in Central Park, beating the previous record of 61 degrees set in 1965. Around the city on Wednesday, people were taking advantage  â€”   walking around in   and tank tops, sitting outdoors at cafes, enjoying parks and promenades. For children who longed for a snow day, the news of the snowstorm was a reason to cheer. Libby Courtemanche had taken her two sons, Christopher, 2, and Bradley, less than a year old, to a park in Huntington, Long Island, on Wednesday. â€œYou know whatâ€™s gonna happen tomorrow?â€ she asked the   . â€œItâ€™s gonna snow. And weâ€™re gonna get to play in the snow. â€ And this roller coaster ride of extremes is sure to provide fuel for those who gripe about the weather. It will be unseasonably warm Wednesday and unpleasantly wintry Thursday, but neither will be just right, of course. Tim Morrin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the drastic shift in weather was â€œunusual, but itâ€™s certainly not unprecedented. â€ The extremes should not be seen as a sign that the gods are angry. Mr. Morrin said it could be explained by two competing weather patterns: cold air masses descending from the North that will push out a   warm air mass in time to chill the city and turn precipitation to snow. â€œAir masses move,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s just the timing. â€ At Cozy Coffee in   Brooklyn, patrons headed straight for the back patio, where owner Migdalia Medina ran cups of coffee and small plates of food plates to people seated at picnic tables under a canopy of bare tree branches. â€œAs soon as they feel it they start coming out,â€ Ms. Medina said of her customers. As for Thursdayâ€™s forecast, she said the patio seating â€œalso looks good under snow. â€ The New York weather historian Steve Fybish, who keeps records of the cityâ€™s weather dating to the 19th century, agreed that the weather swing was not unusual. He rifled through his records to find other days of similar extremes: a snowstorm and a   afternoon within a couple of days in 1984 69 degrees on a November day followed by five inches of snow in 1896. In February 2014, when the Super Bowl was at the Meadowlands, in East Rutherford, N. J. the weather swung sharply. While there had been concerns that the outdoor game at MetLife Stadium would be affected by the cold, game day registered a mild 49 degrees at the stadium and 57 degrees in the city. But the next day, the temperature plunged to 27 degrees followed by a cold snap that was punctuated by eight inches of snow. On Thursday, the snowfall is likely to be heaviest during the morning commute, Mr. Morrin said. â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s going to be anyone rushing anywhere,â€ he said. â€œThe commute time will be impacted. â€"
21111,Death to the Fascist Insect! The SLA and the Cops,Ron Jacobs,"Email 
I was living in New York City when Patty Hearst was kidnapped in February 1974. Like millions of others at the time, I followed the unfolding story with interest. At a time when news was relayed via the radio, newspapers and a daily evening news show, there was plenty of time to speculate what lay behind the actual story. In other words, there werenâ€™t self-appointed experts on every 24-hour news channel telling the viewer what to think. A few months later, I watched the murder of six of the kidnappers on live television. Many media historians consider that event to be the beginning of the 24-hour news cycle we live with now. As Brad Schreiber points out in his newly published investigation of the group responsible for the Hearst kidnapping titled Revolutionâ€™s End: The Patty Hearst Kidnapping, Mind Control, and the Secret History of Donald DeFreeze and the SLA , it was a new technology that first made this live coverage possible. 
Yet, this is not the focus of Schreiberâ€™s text. Indeed, Revolutionâ€™s End is about much more than the kidnapping or its coverage. Instead, it is an investigation into the creation of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), its roots in various law enforcement agencies and its intention to destroy the underground armed left of the early 1970s in the United States. While not a new theory by any means, Schreiberâ€™s narrative is the first such attempt to examine this possibility for the general public. 
From the moment the publicâ€”including the Leftâ€”became aware of the SLAâ€™s existence; doubts about their origins were expressed. In large part, at least on the Left, this was due to the groupâ€™s confused and nebulous politics. Claiming to be an anti-racist organization, the first public attack they made was on the African-American superintendent of schools in Oakland, California, Marcus Foster. Popular among progressives for some of his pedagogical approaches and his relatively forward thinking on issues of race and class, the SLA gunned him down in 1973. Their rationale was that he was instituting a pass system for students similar to the pass system in use by the South African apartheid authorities. In reality, Foster was opposed to the plan and was working to limits its reach in terms of accessibility by the Oakland Police department. Schreiber describes the assassination, writing that the two men convicted of the murder were not actually the gunmen in the crime. In fact, according to Schreiber and his research, it was the leader of the SLA, Donald DeFreeze aka Cinque, who along with a female member, actually committed the murder. 
The persona of DeFreeze is the linchpin to the claims about the SLAâ€™s connection to law enforcement investigated in the book and previous investigations. The primary investigation was conducted by the Los Angeles-based Citizenâ€™s Research and Investigation Committee in the 1970s. The Black Panther Party newspaper published some of this research, showing the connections between DeFreeze, well known LAPD informant/provocateur Louis Tackwood, and California law enforcement agencies in Sacramento. In addition, it is alleged that DeFreeze also worked for the FBI and was a participant in various drug and mind control experiments during his imprisonment in Vacaville California Prisons Medical Facility. 
Like millions of others in the 1970s, I was fascinated by the story of the SLA as it played out in the media. From the kidnapping of Patty Hearst to the distribution of the food ransom to poor people in various California cities to Hearstâ€™s conversion to an urban guerrilla, the unfolding drama was certainly better than most shows on TV. In addition, as a new left activist who was looking (along with many others) for an effective means to make a difference in a political milieu whose numbers were diminishing, I participated in numerous discussions about the SLA and its meaning for the rest of the left. While much of the Left dismissed the group as adventurists, crazy or police provocateurs, the fact of their existence left others wondering if maybe they werenâ€™t sincere, albeit somewhat misreading the political climate both on the Left and in the greater public. 
Even more fascinating than the publicly known story of the SLA, Schreiberâ€™s text takes an extended and serious look at a possible deep narrative regarding the genesis of the SLA. As noted above, it is a narrative often suspected by many leftists and others regarding the groupâ€™s beginnings. By accepting Schreiberâ€™s work, it makes it easier to understand why its members did some of what they did. In essence, Revolutionâ€™s End describes a covert operation undertaken by various law enforcement agencies that went off the rail. Succinctly put, Revolutionâ€™s End postulates (and does a fairly good job of proving) that the group that became the Symbionese Liberation Army was begun in part as an attempt to ferret out potential violent radicals in California while simultaneously attempting to discredit the revolutionary left. Donald DeFreeze played a role as both patsy and organizer while in Vacaville Prison. His role as provocateur raised suspicions, but somehow he was able to belay them. In the meantime, he took advantage of the leeway given him in the prison to sleep with various women on the outside. According to Schreiber, one of these women was Patty Hearst, who was involved in the prisoner rights movement in the period during which the SLA was originally formed. Schreiber describes the SLA as a group with three distinct phases. The first was set up by informants for the above reasons, the second went from this entity to a genuine, albeit confused political group, and the third came after the deaths of members in a police attack on their hideout. It was the last of the formations that included Patty in a more fundamental role than before, as she hid out in communes and hideouts around the United States until she was finally captured with Wendy Yoshimura in 1975 in San Francisco. 
Schreiberâ€™s text covers all the manifestations of the SLA except the last. In doing so, he provides the reader with a look at the nature of an element of the radical underground left in 1970s United States. Even more so, though, is the detailed and convincing examination he provides the reader of how police agencies can and do work to destroy the political enemies of the corporate state. It is this latter aspect that seems most important today, when the intelligence capabilities and legally granted powers to law enforcement agencies are so much greater than they were forty years ago. One need only look at the various entrapment schemes arranged by the FBI and other agencies that have cornered various folks into terror plots that would probably never have existed without the financial, logistical and motivational assistance of those government agencies."

Ivana Trump, the first wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, confirmed what many of us have been thinking for a long time now: Trump is a childish buffoon. Her story of a young Donald Trump on the ski slopes is telling of the temperament we see in the nominee now. Ivana Trump: â€˜He Could Not Take Itâ€™ 
Trump biographer Michael Dâ€™Antonio spoke with Ivana Trump about her marriage to The Donald, and she remembered a time he took her skiing. This was early on, before they married, and one would think Donald would want to show his best side, right? 
No. 
You see, Ivana neglected to tell the young Donald Trump that she was a very accomplished skier. According to Ivana Trump, Donald skied down the slope first, and then: â€œâ€¦ He goes and stops, and he says, â€˜Come on, baby. Come on, baby.â€™ I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Donald was so angry, he took off his skis, his ski boots, and walked up to the restaurant. He could not take it. He could not take it.â€ 
She said he stormed off, saying: â€œIâ€™m not going to do this for anybody, including Ivana.â€ 
We all know by now that Donald Trump is a man who doesnâ€™t like to lose. Ever. He is a man easily baited, easily goaded, and he has the temper of a petulant child. His outbursts have sparked the hashtag #trumpertantrum . 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was correct when she said, in her speech at the Democratic National Convention: â€œA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.â€ 
Nor is a man who storms off in a huff when bested by his girlfriend on the ski slopes. Donald Trump: â€˜I Loved To Fightâ€™ 
Dâ€™Antonio also said that Donald told him how he loved a good fight. â€œI loved to fight. I always loved to fight. All types of fights. Any kind of fight, I loved it, including physical.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a word for people who act like that: Bully. 
Of course, Trump has put his childish, bullying ways on display for the world during this election cycle. Ivana just happened to be one of his earlier victims.

21113,"Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic Sit Atop U.S. Open Draw, With Injuries Sharing Spotlight - The New York Times",David Waldstein,"Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic arrived at the United States Open as the top seeds and favorites to win, but both are nursing injuries. Williams is recovering from a sore right shoulder that forced her to withdraw from an event in Cincinnati last week. Djokovic has a left wrist issue that may have contributed to his loss to Juan MartÃ­n del Potro in the first round at the Rio Olympics. This is a far different entrance into the United States Open than Williams and Djokovic made a year ago. Each surged into the tournament in 2015, with Williams on a highly publicized quest to win the Grand Slam, and Djokovic in search of his third major title of the year. Djokovic collected his championship, but Williams came up short of her goal. Now attention will focus squarely on how they are able to negotiate through their maladies, at least in the early rounds. â€œIt wasnâ€™t very easy, I think, physically,â€ Williams said of her past few weeks. â€œI was just trying so hard and trying everything to get better. At the end of the day, I knew I gave the best effort I could, and it just wasnâ€™t enough. â€ Williams said that her sore shoulder first cropped up the day after she won Wimbledon in July. Then she went to the Olympics and sustained an uncharacteristic   loss to No. 20 Elina Svitolina,    . Just two months earlier, Williams had pounded Svitolina,     at the French Open. â€œAt the Olympics, I just practiced two days before playing my match,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s not ideal, but it was all I could do. â€ As is usually the case with Williams, there is a lot at stake. There is no Grand Slam to tantalize her, but if she wins the Open, she will pass Steffi Graf with her 23rd major tournament victory, an Open era record. She would also pass Chris Evert for the most United States Open singles titles with seven. At the same time, she is fighting to maintain her long hold on the No. 1 ranking. Last week, Williams went to Cincinnati intent on protecting her No. 1 ranking against an assault by Angelique Kerber, who is No. 2. But after an uncomfortable practice there, the aching shoulder forced Williams to withdraw. Kerber could have passed Williams in the rankings if she had won in Cincinnati, but Kerber lost in the final to Karolina Pliskova. Depending on how each fares at the United States Open, Kerber can still end Williamsâ€™s reign at No. 1. Williams has held the top spot for 184 consecutive weeks, two short of Grafâ€™s record. Williams was handed a challenging   matchup against Ekaterina Makarova, ranked No. 36. Williams holds a    advantage over Makarova, who beat Williams at the 2012 Australian Open. They also met in the semifinals of the 2014 United States Open. Williams said her shoulder was starting to feel better, but that she was trying to balance the need for rest with the need to practice. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said he did not believe that the shoulder would hamper Williamsâ€™s pursuit of her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, which would leave her one short of Margaret Courtâ€™s overall record. Although Williams has not played often since Wimbledon, Mouratoglou pointed out that she was competing in two events in each of the last four tournaments she entered, which may have taken a toll. â€œI am not concerned about the shoulder,â€ Mouratoglou said. â€œShe was playing both singles and doubles at Wimbledon and the Olympics, and that is not easy. But she is working hard and recovering well. â€ Djokovic, who won the Australian and French Opens this year, did not cite a precise diagnosis for his wrist injury. He noted the coincidence of playing in Rio against del Potro, who missed three years on the tour with a left wrist injury that required multiple surgeries. Djokovic called the wrist â€œthat essential part of your body as a tennis player. â€ â€œThe wrist hasnâ€™t been in an ideal state for the last three and a half weeks,â€ he said. â€œBut Iâ€™m doing everything in my power with the medical team so Iâ€™m as close to 100 percent as possible, at least for the beginning of it. â€ Djokovic said the injury occurred while he was practicing in Rio, stressing that it was not the reason for his earlier loss to Sam Querrey in the third round at Wimbledon. But Djokovic did say he was dealing with an unspecified personal problem at Wimbledon. â€œWe all have private issues,â€ he said, adding that the matter had been resolved. But the wrist injury is not, and Djokovic, who ended his practice early on Friday, said he was trying a variety of methods to make it heal faster, including electrical stimulation. (He is in the same half of the draw as   Rafael Nadal, who is returning from a wrist injury of his own.) â€œSometimes time is what you need as an athlete, and the U. S. Open is around the corner and I donâ€™t have much time,â€ Djokovic said. â€œI try to compensate and improvise as much as I can and find the best ways of getting myself properly ready. â€"
21114,White House: FBI Leaks â€˜One of Manyâ€™ Reasons Why James Comey Was Fired - Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,"White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said that FBI Director James Comeyâ€™s inability to control leaks out of the bureau was â€œone of manyâ€ reasons why President Donald Trump decided to fire him.  â€œI think thatâ€™s probably one of the many factors,â€ Sanders said in response to a question from Breitbart News during the White House press briefing. â€œI mean you canâ€™t deny somebody that that wasnâ€™t a problem, and so I think that was just another one of many reasons that he no longer had the confidence of the president or the rest of the FBI. â€ Trump has repeatedly called attention to FBI leaks to the media about the investigation into his campaign for any collusion with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. Sanders said that director Comey had â€œessentially taken a stick of dynamiteâ€ to the Justice Department after commenting publicly on the FBI investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s email investigation. When asked if the president was prepared to fire more officials from the Justice Department, Sanders replied, â€œNot that Iâ€™m aware of today. â€ Sanders described a gradual â€œerosion of trustâ€ surrounding Comey since Trump was inaugurated, and that the president wanted to give him a chance despite the reservations he had about the director. She asserted that it was not true that Trump asked the Justice Department to put together a rationale for Comeyâ€™s firing. â€œI did speak directly to the president and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director Comey go pretty much since the day he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at the Department of Justice,â€ she said. She said she was â€œsurprisedâ€ by Democrats rushing to defend Comey, despite their insistence that he directly contributed to Hillary Clintonâ€™s failure to win the presidency. â€œIf Hillary Clinton had won the election, which thank God she didnâ€™t, but if she had and she had been in the same position, she had have fired Comey immediately and the very Democrats that are criticizing the president today would be dancing in the streets celebrating. â€"
21115,Saudi commits crimes on global scale with US green light: Houthi,nan,"Yemen This still shows Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of Yemenâ€™s Houthi Ansarullah movement, delivering a televised speech. (file photo) 
The leader of Yemenâ€™s Houthi Ansarullah movement says Saudi Arabia commits crimes across the globe with the US green light. 
Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said on Wednesday that the Al Saud family has adopted a hypocritical approach in the Muslim world, the proof of which is Takfiri violence gripping the region. 
""When Washington gives the Riyadh regime the green light, sedition sparks in all countries, with the Saudi offensive being in line with such a trend,"" he added. 
The Houthi leader also warned that Saudi Arabia is seeking to damage security in some Arab countries such as Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Iraq through petrodollars and deceptive propaganda works. 
Instead of countering the enemies of Islam, including the US and Israel, the kingdom has been engaged in spreading Takfiri ideology and arming terrorists, Houthi noted. 
'Saudi has Yemenisâ€™ blood on its hands' 
On October 8, in one of the deadliest attacks Yemen, Saudi warplanes bombarded a funeral hall packed with mourners in Sanaâ€™a, killing over 140 people and injuring at least 525 others. 
Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights group, said that the Sanaâ€™a bombing constitutes an apparent war crime, while Amnesty International said the attack was a reminder of the need for the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. People inspect the aftermath of a Saudi airstrike in Sanaâ€™a, Yemen, October 8, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Saudi Arabia committed crimes by the Sanaâ€™a attack, but it tried to acquit itself of the assault, Houthi said, adding that there was no clear sign suggesting an end to the Saudi offensive. 
He also stressed that Yemenis cannot rely on the United Nations as the world body has not adopted a position regarding the Saudi attack in Sanaâ€™a. 
Houthi further wished victory for the Palestinian nation and the resistance front in Lebanon and Syria as well as the Iraqi people in their anti-terror operation in the city of Mosul. 
The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. 
Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. 
The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. The US has been providing logistic and surveillance support to the kingdom in the bloody military campaign. Loading ..."
21116,"After Senate Filibusterâ€™s Death, Somber Lawmakers Seek Path Forward - The New York Times",Jennifer Steinhauer,"WASHINGTON  â€”   The conventional Washington wisdom dictates that the end of the judicial filibuster is also the end of life as it is currently known in the Senate. In truth, it may not make that much of a difference at all. In an unexpected way, it may well herald the beginning of a better era for the Senate. The Senate Republicansâ€™ successful effort on Thursday to end the   threshold to proceed with confirmation of Supreme Court nominees was really only the final step in a process set in motion by Democrats in 2013, when they removed that threshold for other nominees. That set off a far bigger firestorm, and Republicans have now simply extended that precedent. Republicans are quick to point out  â€”   and many Democrats privately agree  â€”   that had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the White House last year and Democrats taken the Senate, a similar confrontation would have been likely in the other direction, and that Democrats might have needed to take the same step Republicans took to confirm any Supreme Court nominee Mrs. Clinton had chosen. Congress has already been dwelling in the rubble for a while. A divisive showdown over a Supreme Court nominee was certainly not helpful in advancing comity, but it has not taken on the widespread acrimony that has consumed both houses of Congress in past fights, such as over government shutdown threats or the perpetual battles over the health care law. Then there is President Trump. Yes, Republicans have labored to promote some of his priorities and look away from his myriad controversies, but they have also shown signs of holding together with Democrats toward mutual goals that are not always in concert with Mr. Trumpâ€™s. To wit: Even as members of both parties railed against one another on the Senate floor on Thursday, appropriators and party leaders in the House and Senate were working to come up with a plan to fund the government for the rest of the year that would most likely ignore Mr. Trumpâ€™s request for a large pile of cash to build a wall on the border with Mexico and cut programs that have bipartisan support. While the White House and the House have struggled to find a way forward on health care, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have held largely together in defiance of   changes to the law that would have left many people in their respective states uninsured. â€œI donâ€™t want to sugarcoat what just happened here,â€ said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, as he walked off the floor after the vote that crushed the minority input, turning the Supreme Court, in his view, into another â€œhyperpartisanâ€ branch of government. But, he said, â€œwe have to get past this  â€”   the American people expect us to find common ground. â€ â€œThe best way to do that,â€ Mr. Peters said, â€œis in a bipartisan way. â€ Senate Republicans are eager to show that they are more functional than the House, where the chairman of the Intelligence Committee on Thursday had to remove himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the election, where an effort to repeal the health care law has embarrassingly blown up and where little prescriptive policy has been seeded in recent years. When it comes to national security, foreign affairs and the issues concerning Russia that are swirling around the White House, the Senate prides itself on bipartisanship, in contrast to the House. â€œIâ€™ve been trying to keep the Russia investigation bipartisan, and I am proud of both sides here,â€ said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. â€œI do think there is the sense that we need to get back to legislating,â€ he added. â€œNeither side has clean hands. â€ Members from purple states are particularly aware of the need to cook up deals. â€œThe place of bipartisan solutions come from the Senate,â€ said Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado. â€œI think people will come together. â€ If an alliance could be struck in the center, the fight for the 60 votes needed to pass might well be led by centrists such as moderate Democrats up for   next year in states where Mr. Trump was victorious, and Republicans like Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The two last week forced Vice President Mike Pence to come to the Hill to break a   tie on a bill that threatened the funding of some Planned Parenthood operators. Ms. Collins has written a letter to the leaders of the Senate seeking a pledge that they will maintain the filibuster rule for legislation, and was gathering signatures from members of both parties on the floor even as the   nuclear option was being played by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. â€œThis event has really sobered people up,â€ said Ms. Collins, who declined to provide further details on the letter. â€œIt has made them realize we cannot continue to operate in such a polarized environment. â€ Several members sent out news releases Thursday promoting bipartisan bills, such as a measure that would require congressional committees to hold oversight hearings on the Government Accountability Office and another that takes aim at sexual assault on college and university campuses. A recent study by the Political Research Quarterly found that even with   control in Congress, leaders are often able to form   majorities on legislation. Already, some Senate Republicans and Democrats are talking privately about a way forward, at least on the insurance exchanges on health care. â€œItâ€™s very preliminary,â€ said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming. â€œBut itâ€™s happening. â€ As long as the filibuster remains a viable option for the minority on legislation  â€”   and Mr. McConnell swears it will not be removed  â€”   they may be able to get a few things done. â€œThis just further intensifies the commitment of the Senate to maintain the legislative margins that have always been a part of the Senate,â€ said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who has held leadership positions in both houses of Congress. â€œI would hope we can start compartmentalizing,â€ and start to get things done, he said. It is also true that Mr. McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, enjoy a better relationship than the one that helped pave the way to Thursdayâ€™s showdown: that of Mr. McConnell and former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. Schumer expressed hope for a different future when he said to Mr. McConnell on the Senate floor on Thursday, â€œLet us go no further on this path. â€"

21118,Trumpâ€™s Harsh Talk With Malcolm Turnbull of Australia Strains Another Alliance - The New York Times,Jane Perlez,"BEIJING  â€”   President Trumpâ€™s combative phone call with Australiaâ€™s prime minister over a refugee agreement has set off a political storm in that country, one that threatens to weaken support for a   alliance with the United States just as many Australians say they want closer ties with China. Enthusiasm for the alliance in Australia, one of Americaâ€™s closest partners, which hosts American spy facilities and rotations of American Marines, had already been under pressure from China, with which Australia conducts the most trade. Reports that Mr. Trump had scolded Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday, before abruptly ending the call, are likely to further undermine confidence in the United States, Australian analysts said. â€œTrump is needlessly damaging the deep trust that binds one of Americaâ€™s closest alliances,â€ said Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University in Canberra. â€œChina and those wishing to weaken the strongest alliance in the Pacific will see opportunity in this moment. â€ In less than two weeks in office, Mr. Trumpâ€™s actions have strained alliances and alienated potential partners of the United States, and his phone call with Mr. Turnbull seemed to be one more example, this time with a country that has fought on Americaâ€™s side since World War I. His administrationâ€™s confrontational stance on Iran has undermined liberal voices in that country his restrictions on immigration from some predominantly Muslim  countries have been widely criticized by allies and his rejection of the   Partnership trade deal threatens to push countries in the   region, including Australia, closer to China. Like many countries in the region, Australia depends on the United States for its security but looks to China for its economic   and it does not want to choose definitively between the two as they wage a global contest for power. Experts said the American and Australian militaries were sufficiently intertwined  â€”   the Royal Australian Air Force has flown in Syria, and Australian soldiers have helped train the Iraqi Army  â€”   that the countriesâ€™ security arrangements would endure. But the trust and confidence underlying the longstanding alliance will be harmed by Mr. Trumpâ€™s apparent lack of respect, and his remarks will be very costly in the public domain, they said. The phone call on Saturday became contentious after Mr. Turnbull pressed Mr. Trump to honor a deal in which the United States had agreed to take in up to 1, 250 refugees being held by Australia at offshore detention centers. Under the terms of the deal, hurriedly worked out by Mr. Turnbull and former President Barack Obama in New York last year, Australia would also accept Central American refugees staying in a Costa Rican detention facility. Australia has been harshly criticized for its offshore detention policy, and the issue is politically delicate at home. Many of the refugees it holds, on the Pacific   of Nauru and on the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea, are from Iran and Iraq. Both countries are among the seven whose citizens are barred from entering the United States for at least 90 days under the executive order Mr. Trump signed on Friday. In his conversation with Mr. Turnbull the next day, Mr. Trump said the deal with Australia was going to hurt him politically, according to a senior official in the Trump administration. Late Wednesday, hours after details of the call were reported, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the agreement was â€œdumb. â€ He said he would need to â€œstudyâ€ it, leaving the door open to renege or to accept fewer refugees. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that Mr. Trump would allow the deal to proceed as long as the refugees were subjected to â€œextreme vetting. â€ Mr. Spicer also said Mr. Trump remained â€œextremely upsetâ€ over the deal arranged by his predecessor. Mr. Turnbull, whose popularity has been sagging over domestic issues, struggled on Thursday to cast the call in a positive light, fending off demands from the opposition Labor Party that he detail exactly what Mr. Trump had said. Even after Mr. Trump made his remarks on Twitter, Mr. Turnbull insisted in a radio interview that he had â€œa clear commitment from the presidentâ€ that the resettlement plans would proceed. â€œThe alliance is absolutely rock solid,â€ Mr. Turnbull said. â€œIt is so strong. â€ The United States Embassy in Canberra had tried to help Mr. Turnbull with his predicament earlier Thursday, saying the White House had confirmed that the agreement would be honored. But after Mr. Trump wrote about the refugee deal on Twitter, the embassy referred questions about the agreement to the White House. Mr. Turnbullâ€™s Liberal Party is the more conservative of Australiaâ€™s two major parties, and it has been a stalwart supporter of close ties with the United States. The Labor Party has leaned slightly more toward China, but as the debate over relations with Washington has intensified in recent months, former leaders of the party have become outspoken critics of the United States and have argued for shifting toward Beijing. Australian attitudes toward relations with the United States, which have historically been favorable, are now under pressure from China and its trading weight, according to polls. That is largely because the enormous Chinese demand for  Australiaâ€™s resources  â€”   particularly iron ore, natural gas and coal  â€”   has bolstered Australiaâ€™s economy for more than a decade. Chinese students also contribute substantially to Australian universities and schools, so much so that many of the institutions are dependent on the fees for survival. And under a new trade agreement, Australia is exporting large quantities of wine and meat to China. After Mr. Trump, in office just a few days, scrapped the   Partnership  â€”   a regional trade pact that the Obama administration had hoped would be an economic counterweight to China  â€”   Mr. Turnbull announced that he would seek to reconstitute the deal without the United States, but possibly including China, another indication of Beijingâ€™s clout. A 2016 survey conducted by the public policy group Lowy Institute asked respondents to identify the country that was more important to Australia 43 percent chose the United States, and 43 percent China. In 2014, 48 percent had answered the United States, and only 37 percent had chosen China, said Sam Roggeveen, a senior fellow at the institute. According to the 2016 survey, 45 percent said that Australia should distance itself from the United States if Mr. Trump became president, Mr. Roggeveen said. â€œWe can assume that number will now rise,â€ said Mr. Medcalf, of Australian National University. â€œThis incident will only intensify the damage done by Trumpâ€™s abandonment of the T. P. P. which would have been a pillar of strategic partnership as well as of trade. â€ The United States operates signals intelligence and radar facilities in remote corners of Australia that are becoming more important as North Koreaâ€™s nuclear threat expands, said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. â€œAustralia shares raw and finished intelligence in the closest possible collaboration you can imagine,â€ Mr. Jennings said. â€œIt is extremely high tech. It is something no countries can equal, and it is part of what is known as the Five Eyes intelligence operation. It has created the highest possible level of trusted collaboration between the five countries. â€ The Five Eyes countries are Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. Mr. Trump visited Australia in 2011, expressing a great liking for the country and entering the fray with China. On Twitter, he called it a â€œbeautiful country with terrific people who love America. â€ Then he added that Australia should â€œscrewâ€ China by raising its commodity prices. James Goldrick, a former rear admiral in the Australian Navy who served in Afghanistan, said that if Mr. Trumpâ€™s current abrasive attitude continued, it would probably make Australia a less publicly cooperative partner of the United States. â€œIf the Trump administration pursues a less consultative approach, Australia will need to become more public in expressing its opinion on American initiatives that it does not wholly support,â€ Mr. Goldrick said. Chinaâ€™s role in Asia and North Koreaâ€™s nuclear efforts are far more important to the United   alliance than any one telephone call, said Peter Hayes, an Australian who is the director of the Nautilus Institute, a   research institute on security issues. But Mr. Trumpâ€™s â€œability to create chaosâ€ has placed those important strategic questions under a â€œdark cloud,â€ he said. â€œThe United States has invested five decades in creating that system of alliances, and it is evident Trump is pretty ignorant of it and doesnâ€™t care about it, to the extent he knows about it,â€ Mr. Hayes said."
21119,The New World Order is melting in the heat of its own contradiction,Jonas E. Alexis,"2013: 7,157 [4] 
Virtually no one in the Zionist media is asking for the perpetrators to be trialed and punished accordingly. But there is more. 
Scholar Rebecca Gordon, who has corresponded with this writer last summer, has recounted in her meticulously documented study Mainstreaming Torture: Ethical Approaches in the Post-9/11 United States : â€œWhen I had occasion in Jordan in 2006 to meet an Iraqi sheik who had been tortured by U.S. forces, his first question to our little group was whether all American women were â€˜promiscuous sluts,â€™ like the ones who had tormented him by forcing him to look at their naked breasts during his detentionâ€¦The psychological trauma of sexual humiliation had damaged this man sufficiently so that polite conversation with American women, even those who were likely to be sympathetic, was beyond him.â€ [5] 
This is just the tip of the iceberg. Gordon discusses one case after another and describes what happened when politicians deliberately abandoned the moral order and pursued perpetual wars in the Middle East at any cost. â€œForcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotapedâ€ was just a fair game. [6] â€œPositioning a naked detainee on a MRE Box, with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and penis to simulate electric tortureâ€ was also quite common. [7] Detainees were also sodomized with chemical lights and broom sticks. [8] 
Gordon writes on the very first page: â€œFor many years, the United States had secretly funded research on torture at U.S. and Canadian universities. One product of this research was the Central Intelligence Agencyâ€™s KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual with its sections covering â€˜non-coerciveâ€™ and â€˜coerciveâ€™ techniques, first printed in 1963â€¦. â€œThe United States had also provided covert training and support to torture regimes in other countries around the worldâ€”from Greece to Uruguay, Chile to El Salvador, Indonesia to Vietnam. The Phoenix Program, implemented during the Vietnam War by U.S. armed forces and the CIA, involved the torture and deaths of tens of thousands of Vietnamese, as part of the U.S. counterinsurgency project designed to break the will of the Viet Cong. In the testimony before Congress, military intelligence officer K. Milton Osborne provided some details of the methods used: â€œâ€˜The use of the insertion of the 6-inch dowel into the 6-inch canal of one of my detaineesâ€™ ears and the tapping through the brain until he dies. The starving to death of a Vietnamese woman who was suspected of being part of the local political education cadre in one of the local villages. They simply starved her to death in one of the hooches at that very counterintelligence headquarters. â€œâ€˜There were other methods of operation which they used for interrogation, such as the use of electronic gear such as sealed telephone attached to the genitals of both the men and womenâ€™s vagina and the manâ€™s testicles, and wind the mechanism and create an electrical charge and shock them into submission.â€™â€ [9] 
Between 1968 and 1971, the Phoenix Program was responsible for torturing and killing more than twenty thousand people, [10] many of whom had nothing to do with terrorism. These were not isolated cases. The CIA conducted these essentially diabolical operations â€œon several continents.â€ [11] 
If history is not enough, what about the recent charge by Amnesty International that the US-led coalition in Syria has killed at least 300 civilians? [12] And what about Saudi Arabia (a US ally) â€œdeliberately targeting impoverished Yemenâ€™s farms and agricultural industryâ€? [13] Stephen Kinzer, a visiting scholar at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, has recently written: â€œAnyone who believes the United States is not fighting enough wars in the Middle East can be happy this week. We have just plunged into another one. Twice in recent days, cruise missiles fired from an American destroyer have rained down on Yemen. The Pentagon, a practiced master of Orwellian language, calls this bombing â€˜limited self-defense.â€™ â€œSince 2002, our drone attacks have reportedly killed more than 500 Yemenis, including at least 65 civilians. We are also supplying weapons and intelligence to Saudi Arabia, which has killed thousands of Yemenis in bombing raids over the last year and a half â€” including last weekâ€™s attack on a funeral in which more than 100 mourners were killed.â€ [14] 
So the logic is pretty simple: the New World Order ideology does not and cannot make sense at all. And if we have to fight ISIS, then we have to support the Assad government; if we have to support the Assad government, then the whole idea that Assad is a â€œbrutal rulerâ€ loses its political force; if that idea goes down the tube, then the New World Order propaganda against Assad is categorically false. In short, we can ignore flaming Neocon Charles Krauthammer when he said last November that Assad is a â€œdictator and a destroyer.â€ [15] This brings us to another vitally important issue: New World Order agents spent millions upon millions of tax dollars supporting ISIS or al-Nusra in Syria for absolutely nothing. Barnes-Dacey and Levy concluded their article by saying, â€œWestern leaders have defined ISIS as a threat to their national security. That should now translate into a more nuanced Syria policy, including working with Iran and encouraging the nascent Saudi-Iranian opening.â€ [16] 
I simply could not hold my laughter. For decades, New World Order agents in America and Israel have hammered the spurious idea that Iran is a terrorist state and that it wants to â€œwipe Israel off the mapâ€; [17] they also spent millions upon millions of dollars trying to destabilize the country both politically and ideologically. 
Remember how Obama â€œsecretly ordered increasingly sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran â€™s main nuclear enrichment facilities, significantly expanding Americaâ€™s first sustained use of cyber-weaponsâ€? [18] 
Remember how New World Order agents in America and Israel developed Stuxnet specifically to attack Iran, a country that has zero nuclear weapons? [19] The New York Times itself acknowledged then that the cyberattack was â€œaided by Israel.â€ [20] 
In the same vein, the Washington Post reported that Stuxnet was the â€œwork of U.S. and Israeli experts.â€ [21] And it was developed way back in 2007 . 
Remember how Bush also made false accusations against Iran and even trained the terrorist group the MEK right here in America? [22] Remember how he worked with Israel to perform a covert operation in Iran? â€œMr. Kissinger, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.â€ 
So, all the tax dollars that were spent on destabilizing Iran for more than a decade was a waste. At the same time, decent American military hospitals continued to lack funding: 
â€œmany of the hospitals are so small and the trickle of patients so thin that it compromises the ability of doctors and nurses to capably diagnose and treat serious illnesses, much less take on surgeries â€¦ 
â€œTwo-thirds of the hospitals last year served 30 or fewer inpatients a day â€” less than a third as many as the typical civilian hospital. Nine served 10 or fewer â€” so few that Dr. Lucian L. Leape, a leading patient-safety expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, said, â€˜I think they should be outlawed.â€™â€ [23] 
Obviously New World Order agents donâ€™t care either about military hospitals and even soldiers. In fact, they donâ€™t care about anyone at all. They just care about spreading their essentially diabolical system. Soldiers are just pawns. As Henry Kissinger diabolically declared, military men are â€œdumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.â€ [24] 
Once those â€œdumb, stupid animalsâ€ can no longer be of service to NWO agents, then they just dump them. They have already dumped at least 360,000 thousand veterans, who â€œmay have brain injuries.â€ [25]

Shear and Peter Baker,"WASHINGTON  â€”   President Trump intends to move forward with a major investigation of voter fraud that he says cost him the popular vote, White House officials said Wednesday, despite bipartisan condemnation of his allegations and the conclusion of Mr. Trumpâ€™s own lawyers that the election was â€œnot tainted. â€ In his first days in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has renewed his complaint that millions of people voted illegally, depriving him of a   majority. In two Twitter posts early Wednesday morning, the president vowed to open an inquiry to reveal people who are registered to vote in multiple states or who remain on voting rolls long after they have died. â€œWe have to understand where the problem exists, how deep it goes, and then suggest some remedies to it,â€ said Sean Spicer, the presidentâ€™s press secretary. He said the White House would reveal more details this week. But voting officials in both parties across the country said the answer to those questions is already clear: Fraudulent voting happens in tiny, sporadic episodes that have no impact on the outcome of elections. It is virtually impossible, several state election officials said, that millions of people voted illegally in last yearâ€™s presidential contest. In fact, that was the conclusion of Mr. Trumpâ€™s own lawyers last year as they sought to stop recount efforts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. â€œAll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,â€ Mr. Trumpâ€™s lawyers wrote in their response to recount petitions by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. Mr. Spicer said the lawyers were referring only to states where Mr. Trump campaigned extensively. In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, a Republican, said Wednesday in an interview that there was â€œno evidenceâ€ that voter fraud was happening on a large scale. Edgardo CortÃ©s, Virginiaâ€™s election chief, a Democrat, said there was â€œno basisâ€ for the claims. And Californiaâ€™s Democratic secretary of state lashed out at the president for undermining confidence in the election system. â€œFree and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and heâ€™s taken a jackhammer to it with his irresponsible tweets,â€ said Alex Padilla, the stateâ€™s top election official. â€œWhatever proof or evidence he said he had, he clearly didnâ€™t have. His allegations since November are clearly lies, not alternative facts. â€ Mr. Trump has repeatedly shifted his view of the election system. As a candidate, he frequently railed against what he called a â€œriggedâ€ election. When he became   he complained about â€œserious voter fraud,â€ but later reversed himself and mocked Ms. Steinâ€™s recount efforts as â€œa scamâ€ and a waste of time and money. This week, he   again, telling lawmakers at a White House reception that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted for her. Mr. Spicer declined to elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant but did not back away from the assertion. â€œThe president does believe that,â€ Mr. Spicer said. â€œItâ€™s a belief that heâ€™s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. And thatâ€™s based on information thatâ€™s provided. â€ It remains unclear what form a federal investigation may take. While the F. B. I. has the authority to look into voter fraud, that appears not to be what the president has in mind. Mr. Spicer said it was too early to know, but mentioned the possibility of a task force or commission. He cited studies that he said showed that voter rolls contained the names of millions of people who should not be there because they had moved, were not citizens or had since died. But the author of one of those major studies said Wednesday that Mr. Spicer and the president appeared to be misunderstanding the numbers. David Becker, who for six years was in charge of the election initiative for the Pew Center on the States, said that voter rolls often had    information, but that there was virtually no evidence that many of those names were used to vote illegally. â€œIt does exist, but it happens in very, very small numbers and nothing like what is claimed by the president,â€ Mr. Becker said. He said systems across the country to prevent voter fraud would have caught any huge effort to vote illegally. â€œWe would have seen that well before the election,â€ he said. â€œWe would have seen a swelling of the voter rolls and records. â€ In Ohio, for example, a review of the stateâ€™s elections in 2012 and 2014 found that out of millions of votes cast, there were 667 allegations of fraud, of which just 149 were referred to law enforcement for investigation, Mr. Husted said. The Ohio review, which happens after every election, also found that 436 unauthorized immigrants were registered to vote and that 44 had voted. â€œVoter fraud exists. Itâ€™s not widespread or systemic,â€ said Mr. Husted, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. â€œThereâ€™s no evidence that that is happening on a   basis. â€ Mr. Husted said he would be happy to share Ohioâ€™s review of the 2016 election with the federal government when it was completed. And he said Mr. Trump could aid states by sharing government databases that could help them clean their voter rolls. In his Twitter message Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that a federal review could lead to improvements in voting procedures. But Democrats and voting experts criticized the president for focusing his allegations on voter fraud while resisting the intelligence communityâ€™s conclusions involving Russian hacking of the Democratic National Commitee and officials connected to Mrs. Clinton during last yearâ€™s election. â€œItâ€™s more important that we investigate the known instances of election fraud, rather than imagined ones,â€ said Kim Alexander, the president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the voting process. â€œWe have had an election that was compromised by foreign interests. Thatâ€™s the real danger that has come out of this election. â€ Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the president should â€œknock this offâ€ and move on. â€œThis is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,â€ he said on CNN. And several Democratic lawmakers and state election officials said they suspected that Mr. Trumpâ€™s allegations were part of a plan by Republicans looking for reasons to justify new restrictions on voting to benefit their party, particularly targeting immigrants and  . â€œThere has been a sustained effort across the country, rooted in similar conspiracies about voter fraud, to make it harder for Americans to vote,â€ Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement. â€œWe canâ€™t allow this attack on voting rights to continue, and itâ€™s shameful to see such debunked conspiracy theories emanating from the White House. â€ Mr. Padilla, the California secretary of state, said he also worried that Mr. Trumpâ€™s repeated allegations about fraud would undermine the confidence that Americans had in the integrity of the voting system. â€œStoking fear and concern is undermining peopleâ€™s faith in our elections,â€ he said."
21121,"One Rationale for Voter ID Debunked, G.O.P. Has Another - The New York Times",Michael Wines,"Of the 860, 000 Nebraskans who cast ballots in last fallâ€™s election, only two are suspected of casting fraudulent votes. But while the actual number of illegal voters may be minuscule, State Senator John Murante says, there is an even better reason for Nebraskaâ€™s Legislature to crack down on fraud at the ballot box. â€œFirst and foremost, we know the confidence that Americans and Nebraskans have in the election system is at an   low,â€ said Mr. Murante, a Republican who is backing a constitutional amendment that would require all voters to display photo IDs. â€œThe perception exists that voter fraud is a serious issue, and that perception itself has to be addressed. â€ Nationwide, Republican state legislators are again sponsoring a sheaf of bills tightening requirements to register and to vote. And while they have traditionally argued that such laws are needed to police rampant voter fraud  â€”   a claim most experts call unfounded  â€”   some are now saying the perception of fraud, real or otherwise, is an equally serious problem, if not worse. Given Republicansâ€™ history of raising undocumented claims of fraud, Democrats and voting rights advocates say that citing perceptions of tainted ballots as a reason for voting restrictions is disingenuous at best. â€œIt seems strange that someone who created the problem of perception then says we have to solve the problem, when there is no problem,â€ said Lloyd Leonard, the advocacy director for the League of Women Voters, which has sued to block a number of restrictive voting laws. In states across the country, Republicans are echoing the Nebraska argument for   measures. â€œIt is true that there isnâ€™t widespread voter fraud,â€ said State Representative Ken Rizer, who steered a bill requiring voters to display IDs through the Iowa House of Representatives this month. â€œBut there is a perception that the system can be cheated. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons for doing this. â€ In Arkansas, State Representative Mark Lowery said his voter ID bill aimed to prevent fraud. But even more important, he added, is that â€œa large percentage of Americans do not trust the integrity of the electoral system, and that in and of itself is a problem that needs to be solved, because that undermines the basic tenet of democracy. â€ There is history to this, said Allegra Chapman, the director of voting and elections at the advocacy group Common Cause. The first Supreme Court ruling to support voter ID laws, in an Indiana case called Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, acknowledged in 2008 that there was zero evidence of voter fraud in the state. But as long as the law inconvenienced everyone equally, it could be legal  â€”   even if it deterred â€œsignificant numbersâ€ of voters from voting  â€”   if it had a â€œsufficiently weightyâ€ justification. Trust in elections met that standard, the court added, because confidence could be low â€œif no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud. â€ As   evidence of the lawsâ€™ impact on minorities has snowballed, the Crawford decision has come under growing criticism. Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  â€”   a highly regarded conservative  â€”   wrote the 2007 decision on Crawford that the Supreme Court upheld. But by 2014 he had recanted, issuing a blistering dissent in a Wisconsin voter ID case that called ID laws a â€œfig leafâ€ for disenfranchising citizens, and specifically rejecting the claim that bolstering votersâ€™ confidence justified them. Ms. Chapman said she suspected that the perception argument was a political talking point devised in the wake of several federal court rulings last year that the laws discriminated against   minorities. â€œTheyâ€™re being clever,â€ she said. â€œTheyâ€™re trying to find some legitimate grounds for which to have these laws pass muster. â€ After the Supreme Court handed victory in the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush, furious Democrats called the vote deeply flawed. Since then, dubious charges of fraud have become a staple of Republican crusades for laws tightening the rules for registering and casting votes. Those charges reached a new peak when President Trump railed against â€œriggedâ€ elections while a candidate and claimed without any evidence that he would have won the popular vote but for millions of illegal votes cast against him. Faith in the electoral process has markedly declined since 2000, surveys show.  One poll, released in October, concluded that barely four in 10 Americans had great confidence in an accurate vote count. Voter fraud does happen, of course, sometimes in striking fashion. A former chairman of Coloradoâ€™s Republican Party, a radio   host who stated on the air in October that â€œvirtually every case of voter fraud I can remember in my lifetime was committed by Democrats,â€ was charged this month with voter fraud. The former chairman, Steve Curtis, was accused of filling out a ballot addressed to his   who lives in South Carolina. But voting rights advocates say that widespread fraud is a myth, and that most restrictions are created to keep   minorities and young adults away from the polls. Judges lately have agreed last year, federal courts ruled that voter ID laws in Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin and North Dakota discriminated against minorities. Many academic studies conclude that   laws depress turnout.  But the conclusion is not unanimous this month, researchers at Stanford, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania took issue with one such study concluding that voter ID laws depress Democratic voter turnout far more than Republican turnout. The researchers evaluated the same data used in the study and found â€œno apparent relationshipâ€ between the laws and turnout. In the wake of Republican claims, bills have been filed in at least 27 state legislatures to stiffen rules or document requirements for registering and voting, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. At least 16 have proposed new or revised voter ID laws many more are tightening requirements to register. Iowaâ€™s voter ID bill, which appears headed for passage in the State Senate, is typical of many, requiring voters to display a driverâ€™s license or  â€™s license, a military or veteran identification card or a passport. Voters lacking those documents would be able to vote after signing an oath attesting to their identity. â€œWe are not without fraud,â€ said Mr. Rizer, who noted that 41 disenfranchised felons cast ballots in November (all but five were discovered before being counted). Critics, including the stateâ€™s local election officials, say undetected fraud at the polls is so minuscule that it does not merit   voters who already proved their identity when they registered. Among other states, New Hampshire is close to approving legislation to stiffen residency requirements for new voters, including a written warning that law enforcement officers may visit votersâ€™ homes to verify residency. Mr. Trump was able to provide no documentation for a widely derided claim that Massachusetts residents were bused into New Hampshire to cast illegal ballots that contributed to his defeat there. â€œNobodyâ€™s saying thereâ€™s evidence of widespread fraud,â€ said Regina Birdsell, a Republican state senator and the billâ€™s sponsor. â€œBut our voter laws are so broad you could drive a Mack truck through them. â€ She added, â€œThere is a perception, as far as I am concerned, that the laws need to be tightened up. â€ The Arkansas legislature has already voted to place a constitutional amendment on the stateâ€™s 2018 ballot that would require voters to display IDs. Mr. Loweryâ€™s bill takes a different tack it would put in place the ID requirement more quickly and without a ballot initiative. Unlike many such bills, his takes an expansive view of acceptable identification  â€”   from   IDs to employee badges to student identification cards. Voters without IDs can cast ballots if they swear they are who they say they are. â€œWeâ€™re trying to give them every chance,â€ he said, â€œbut we want them to vouch for their identity. â€"
21122,How Donald Trump Set Off a Civil War Within the Right-Wing Media - The New York Times,Robert Draper,"In recent years, one of the most important events on a prospective Republican presidential candidateâ€™s calendar was the RedState Gathering, a summer convention for conservative activists from across the nation. Its host was Erick Erickson, a   redheaded former election lawyer and city councilman in Macon, Ga. who began blogging in 2004 on a site called RedState. com. Erickson, who is now 41, is a conservative absolutist who made his name in the   by â€œblowing upâ€  â€”   in the Twitter parlance he jovially employs  â€”   Republican leaders he viewed as insufficiently principled. In 2005, he played a role in torpedoing the Supreme Court nomination of the White House counsel Harriet Miers, publishing damaging admissions from White House sources that Miers had not been properly vetted. Five years later, he chided the National Rifle Association for being too willing to compromise, labeling it â€œa weak little girl of an organization. â€ He was a   critic of John McCain and Mitt Romney during their presidential runs, characterizing the former as â€œan angry old jackassâ€ and the latter as â€œthe Harriet Miers of 2012. â€ Along the way, Erickson became one of the new kingmakers of the Tea   G. O. P. A   Florida legislator and Senate hopeful named Marco Rubio reached out to him in 2009 when he was at 3 percent in the polls. A former Texas solicitor general, Ted Cruz, did the same in 2011. Rick Perry announced his 2012 presidential candidacy at Ericksonâ€™s gathering. By 2015, a number of the coming cycleâ€™s aspirants  â€”   Rubio, Cruz, Perry and Bobby Jindal  â€”   had given him their personal cellphone numbers, and he had traded emails with Jeb Bush. And two months before that Augustâ€™s convention in Atlanta, a New   Republican consultant named Sam Nunberg reached out to Erickson to ask if he could accommodate one more speaker: Donald Trump. Erickson watched coverage of Trumpâ€™s    announcement at Trump Tower on June 16 and was not particularly impressed. On the syndicated radio show he broadcasts from Atlanta, he offered his assessment with a dismissive chuckle: â€œI guess heâ€™s ready to be spoiler, not president. â€ He had met Trump once before, in July 2011, when he visited the 26th floor of Trump Tower to interview the businessman and    star. Trump had spent the past few months flirting with a presidential run only to decide, as he told Erickson that day, â€œI have a great show thatâ€™s a big success, and itâ€™s hard to say, â€˜Iâ€™m gonna leave two hours of   television in order to get beat up by people that donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing. â€™â€™u2009â€ The hourlong conversation struck Erickson as pleasant but unmemorable. What did stick with him was their exchange as he was leaving Trump Tower. â€œTrump asked me if I played golf,â€ Erickson told me recently. â€œAnd I said, â€˜Yeah, Iâ€™m terrible. â€™â€™u2009â€ Then, he said, Trump asked if he would be interested in coming to Trumpâ€™s   in West Palm Beach, Fla. to play. â€œIâ€™m very flattered  â€”   Iâ€™ve never been to West Palm Beach before,â€ Erickson recalled. â€œSeveral times, his office reached out. So finally I asked my wife, â€˜What do you think this is about?â€™ She said, â€˜He wants to own your soul.â€™ So I never went. â€ Erickson did not see much of a political future for Trump, but he imagined that he might be good for ticket sales, if nothing else, at the RedState Gathering. He informed Nunberg that Trump could have a slot on the conventionâ€™s second day. The evening before he was to speak in Atlanta, Trump went on CNN and denounced the Fox News host Megyn Kelly for her sharp questioning of him during a recent debate, speculating that Kelly had â€œblood coming out of her wherever. â€ When Erickson saw the footage that evening, he called Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and rescinded Trumpâ€™s invitation on the grounds that he would be too much of a distraction. â€œAnd that was that,â€ Erickson would later recall with a sheepish grin. â€œUntil the next day, when heâ€™s blowing me up. â€ On Twitter, Trump called Erickson â€œa major sleaze and buffoonâ€ and said that the â€œsmall crowdsâ€ at the gathering were due to his absence. Trumpâ€™s supporters soon piled on. This was to be expected, but what surprised Erickson were the attacks from people he regarded as his fellow   in the conservative revolution. On Twitter, the   host and Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham mocked â€œJebState. â€ The author and   provocateur Ann Coulter brought up some of Ericksonâ€™s own crass utterances, like his characterization of the former Supreme Court justice David Souter in 2009 as a â€œ [expletive] child molester. â€ The next week, 30, 000 readers of Ericksonâ€™s email newsletter canceled their subscriptions. Erickson dug in, writing that Trump was â€œout of his depthâ€ and lacking in â€œcommon decency. â€ But he was drowned out by Trump sympathizers with even bigger audiences than his own, like The Drudge Report and the online outlet Breitbart. It was one of the first salvos in what would open up in the year that followed into a civil war within the conservative media, dividing some of the loudest voices on the right. Days earlier, Erickson had unimpeachable credentials in the conservative movement. But by crossing Trump, he was now, in the eyes of his former allies, â€œa tool of the establishment. â€ The conservative media has always been a playground for outsize personalities with even more outsize political ambitions. The National Review founder William F. Buckley fashioned much of the intellectual genetic code of the Reagan Revolution, while also writing fringe groups like the John Birch Society out of the conservative movement and, for good measure, running for mayor of New York against the liberal Republican John Lindsay. In 1996, the former Nixon media consultant Roger Ailes brought his   ethos to Rupert Murdochâ€™s Fox News channel and built the network into a transformational power in Republican politics before his fall this year amid accusations of sexual harassment. But alongside the   like Buckley and Ailes, the   landscape has also produced a class of rowdy entrepreneurs who wield their influence in more personal, protean ways. The godfathers mostly came to power in the 1990s:   antagonists like Rush Limbaugh, who began broadcasting nationally in 1988 and became talk radioâ€™s hegemonic power in the Clinton years, and Matt Drudge, who started his pioneering Drudge Report online in 1996. If these figures defied the stuffy ceremony of the East Coast think tanks, opinion journals and   columnists who traditionally defined the conservative intelligentsia, they rarely challenged the ideological principles of conservatism as they had existed since the Reagan era: small government, low taxes, hawkish foreign policy and traditional social values. What they mostly did was provide the Republican Party with a set of exceptionally loud megaphones, which liberals have often envied and tried unsuccessfully to emulate. Conservative talk radio and Fox News now collectively reach an audience of as many as 50 million  â€”   most of them elderly white Republicans with a high likelihood of turning out in election years. And this isnâ€™t even counting the   online outlets that have flourished during the Obama years, thanks to a growing   economy and a presidency, particularly in the case of the Affordable Care Act, that gave conservatives common cause. Then came Trump. In a sense, the divide that he has opened up among conservative media figures is simply a function of the heartburn his ascent has caused among Republicans more generally, pitting voter against voter, congressman against congressman, Bob Dole against the Bushes. Some conservative media outlets threw themselves behind Trump from the beginning, explaining away his more radioactive statements and his    record as a conservative. Breitbart, whose former chairman, Steve Bannon, is now Trumpâ€™s chief strategist, was an ardent early supporter, breathlessly covering Trumpâ€™s ascent in the polls and his smackdowns of â€œlow energyâ€ Jeb Bush and â€œlittle Marcoâ€ Rubio. But as Trump expanded into more sacrosanct targets  â€”   Fox Newsâ€™s Kelly, George W. Bushâ€™s performance in the war on terror and Cruz  â€”   the dissenting chorus among conservatismâ€™s dons grew louder. The Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer warned in December that Trump â€œhas managed to steer the entire G. O. P. campaign into absurdities. â€ His Post colleague George Will predicted that a Trump nomination would mean the loss of conservatism â€œas a constant presence in U. S. politics. â€ The Weekly Standard editor William Kristol floated the idea of a new â€œ    party. â€ And on the eve of the Iowa caucus, National Review devoted an entire issue to a single topic: â€œAgainst Trump. â€ Since Trump clinched the nomination, the dividing lines have become starker, the individual dilemmas more agonizing. Mark Levin, an influential   host, complains that among conservative commentators, Trumpâ€™s message is endlessly repeated by what he derisively refers to as â€œthe Rockettes. â€ But Levin, too, recently announced to his listeners that he intends to vote for Trump, if only to prevent another Clinton presidency. As he put it to me, â€œIâ€™m not going to be throwing confetti in the air if Trump wins,â€ adding that he viewed the candidate as â€œa liberal with some conservative viewpoints that heâ€™s not terribly reliable at sticking to. â€ Others  â€”   Sean Hannity, Ingraham, the former Reagan official and â€œThe Book of Virtuesâ€ author William Bennett  â€”   have thrown in for Trump with a brio that strikes some in the business as unseemly. â€œLook, weâ€™re in the opinion business, but thereâ€™s a distinction between that and being a Sean Hannity fanboy,â€ the     host Charlie Sykes told me. â€œItâ€™s been genuinely stunning to watch how theyâ€™ve become tools of his campaign and rationalizing everything heâ€™s done. â€ â€œFor 20 years Iâ€™ve been saying how itâ€™s not true that talk radio is all about ratings and we donâ€™t believe what we say,â€ he went on. â€œThen you watch how the media types rolled over for him. Obviously Donald Trump is very good for ratings, and at some point itâ€™s hard not to conclude they decided the Trump train was the gravy train. Iâ€™ve been thoroughly disillusioned, and Iâ€™m not alone in that. Itâ€™s like watching â€˜Invasion of the Body Snatchersâ€™: Oh, my God, they got another one!â€ When Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, the part of his announcement speech that most clearly foreshadowed the campaign to come had to do with immigration. â€œWhen Mexico sends its people, theyâ€™re not sending their best,â€ he told the crowd at Trump Tower. â€œTheyâ€™re sending people that have lots of problems, and theyâ€™re bringing those problems with us. Theyâ€™re bringing drugs. Theyâ€™re bringing crime. Theyâ€™re rapists. â€ The line struck Sykes as awfully familiar when he heard it. A month before, he had run a segment with Ann Coulter, who had just published her 11th book, an   screed titled â€œÂ¡Adios, America!â€ Sykes was well aware of Coulterâ€™s views, but he was taken aback when she began a riff on Mexican rapists surging into the United States (a subject that takes up an entire chapter of â€œÂ¡Adios, America! â€). â€œI remember looking at my producer and going, â€˜Wow, this is rather extraordinary,â€™â€™u2009â€ he told me. â€œWhen Trump used that line, I instantly recognized it as Ann Coulterâ€™s. â€ In fact, Corey Lewandowski had reached out to Coulter for advice in the   to Trumpâ€™s announcement speech. The address Trump delivered on June 16 bore no resemblance to his prepared text, which contained a mere two sentences about immigration. Instead, he   what Coulter today calls â€œthe Mexican rapist speech that won my heart. â€ When Trumpâ€™s remarks provoked fury, Lewandowski called Coulter for backup. Three days later, she went on HBOâ€™s â€œReal Time With Bill Maherâ€ and, amid shrieks of laughter from the audience, predicted that Trump was the Republican candidate most likely to win the presidency. One evening this past March, Trump received Coulter at    his    in Palm Beach. Though in recent years the two had developed a rapport on Twitter, she had met him face to face only once before he declared his candidacy, a lunch date at Trump Tower in 2011. Over lunch, Trump gave Coulter the impression that he had read her books. He also gave her a few items from his wifeâ€™s line of costume jewelry and told Coulter, who keeps a house in Palm Beach, that she was welcome to use the pool at    anytime. The golf resort was the chief staging ground for Trumpâ€™s charm offensives against the conservative media. Many of its members have visited at Trumpâ€™s invitation in recent years, joining the resident Gatsby for steak and lobster on the patio, where Trump squints and appears to listen intently while his guests dispense political wisdom  â€”   though it is never clear whether he is actually interested in it, simply flattering his guests or sizing them up. When I dined with him on the patio this spring, Trump asked me eagerly about how I liked his odds in the election. Later, on the campaign trail, I watched him solicit the same counsel from random stragglers on the rope line. Coulter, at any rate, appeared immune to the whole routine. A week earlier, Trump bragged during a Republican presidential debate in Detroit that â€œthereâ€™s no problemâ€ with the size of his penis. On the patio, Coulter told the candidate that no one wanted to hear about his endowment. She told Lewandowski that he should buy a dozen teleprompters and put them in every room of Trumpâ€™s house until he learned how to use them. Reminding Trump that she had been his earliest and most dedicated advocate, she told him: â€œIâ€™m the only one losing money trying to put you in the White House. Youâ€™re going to listen to me. â€ This appeal to the bottom line seemed to tweak Trumpâ€™s conscience. He gave Coulter an open invitation to    waiving the $100, 000 membership fee. The following evening at the next Republican debate, he exhibited considerably more restraint, for which Coulter, with characteristic modesty, claims credit. â€œCoulter delivers!â€ she told me. Some of Trumpâ€™s supporters within the conservative media are attracted to his actual positions on issues. One is his trade policy, on which many media personalities on the right are considerably more populist and protectionist than Republican Party leaders and Chamber of Commerce boosters. Throughout Obamaâ€™s presidency, Laura Ingraham has warned of Chinaâ€™s predations: â€œThe trade war is on, and weâ€™re losing it,â€ she has often said. For others, Trumpâ€™s assurance that he will appoint Antonin   conservatives to the Supreme Court is reason enough for their support. But Trump also simply fulfills the ineffable urge many have to, as Michael Needham, the chief executive of the conservative policy group Heritage Action for America, puts it, â€œpunch Washington in the face. â€ This is true for Coulter, who, in her newly published paean to the candidate, â€œIn Trump We Trust,â€ writes that Trump is fit for the presidency not in spite of his crudeness but because of it: â€œOnly someone who brags about his airlineâ€™s seatbelt buckles being made of solid gold would have the balls to do what Trump is doing. â€ But what really sold Coulter on Trump, she told me, was his hard line on immigration. Coulter told me that she had never given the issue much thought during her childhood in New Canaan, Conn. and her student days at Cornell. Then in 1992, the   journalist Peter Brimelow wrote a   essay for National Review titled â€œTime to Rethink Immigration?â€ which would later become a sort of   for todayâ€™s   the ascendant   movement that has found its champion in Trump. Brimelow cast the current wave of American immigrants in dismal terms: less skilled, less European, less assimilated, less   and less Republican than the previous newcomers. Coulter, who was 31 and a law clerk at the time, remembers reading it and thinking, â€œOh, my gosh, Iâ€™ve been completely lied to!â€   years later, Coulter helped formulate Trumpâ€™s   position, which she hailed on Twitter as â€œthe greatest political document since the Magna Carta. â€ (Her additional tweet on the subject  â€”   â€œI donâ€™t care if @realDonaldTrump wants to perform abortions in the White House after this immigration policy paperâ€  â€”   prompted Mark Levin to tweet back, â€œThese have to be among the most pathetic comments of anyone in a long time. â€) Coulter has not always gotten her way with the candidate. At    that evening in March, she lobbied unsuccessfully for him to pick as his running mate Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who is credited with selling Mitt Romney on â€œ . â€ And her book tour for â€œIn Trump We Trustâ€ hit a momentary snag when Trump told Sean Hannity that he would be open to â€œsofteningâ€ his immigration stance, though Coulter chose to believe that, as she told me, â€œit was Hannity badgering him. â€ Still, she has become the Trump campaignâ€™s most unrepentant brawler. When Khzir Khan, the   father of a U. S. Army captain who was killed in combat in Iraq, spoke critically of Trump at the Democratic National Convention, Coulter wrote on Twitter: â€œYou know what this convention really needed: An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria[sic]. â€ That tweet provoked disgust from fellow conservatives, among them Erick Erickson, who tweeted: â€œWhat a terrible thing to say about a man whose son died for this country. â€ When I reminded Coulter of Ericksonâ€™s scolding, she let out a hearty laugh. â€œI always hated him,â€ she said. â€œThis is one of the fantastic things. In any political movement, there are many people you think are losers and dorks, but your friends talk you into liking them, because theyâ€™re on our side. Now all of those people are out. â€ Sighing, she said, â€œTrump has made my life better in so many ways. â€ You will not find copies of â€œÂ¡Adios, America!â€ or â€œIn Trump We Trustâ€ on any of the many bookshelves in the home of the Washington Post columnist George Will. A week after Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race in early May, Will and his wife, Mari, a Republican political consultant, gave a catered dinner party for Cruz and his wife, Heidi. The other guests were conservative donors, activists and journalists, along with their spouses. The Wills have been hosting these    encounters with political celebrities at their Maryland home for decades. In early 2009, Willâ€™s fellow conservative columnists gathered there to meet Obama a week before his inauguration. Among the guests that evening in May was Laura Ingraham. Ingraham is of proudly   heritage  â€”   her mother was a waitress for almost 30 years and her father owned and operated a    carwash  â€”   and does not share Willâ€™s reverence for decorum. She was an early defender of Trumpâ€™s willingness to say things â€œno one else is saying. â€ While interviewing Cruz on her radio show six weeks before the Willsâ€™ party, she interrupted him to mock his Harvard Law degree. Still, Cruz knew that his political future relied on conservative   like Ingraham, and it was at his request that the Wills included her in the party. Over cocktails, the Cruzes spoke fondly of their experiences on the campaign trail, and the other guests listened politely, mindful of Cruzâ€™s recent humiliating defeat. Then midway through dinner, at a table set with glasses once used by Abraham Lincoln, Ingraham insisted that Cruz needed to throw his weight behind the man who had branded him â€œLyinâ€™ Ted. â€ â€œIf you donâ€™t endorse him, where does that leave you?â€ she said. â€œYou donâ€™t have the public and you donâ€™t have the establishment. How can you be a leader of the conservative movement?â€ Cruz amiably replied that such a decision did not have to be made right away. Others at the table joined in to defend him, but Ingraham would hear nothing of it. â€œYou canâ€™t want Hillary Clinton elected,â€ she goaded him. Will sat fuming silently. â€œShe was quite animated,â€ he would later recall. Cruz refused to offer his support to Trump that night or in the weeks to follow. Speaking at the Republican convention on July 20 moments before Cruz was to do the same, Ingraham taunted him: â€œWe should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos  â€”   and we love you, we love you  â€”   but you must honor the pledge to support Donald Trump now, tonight!â€ The following morning on her radio show, Ingraham declared that Cruzâ€™s refusal to endorse had â€œeffectively ended his political career. â€ Will was no more persuaded by Ingraham than Cruz was. The first and only time Will met Trump was in March 1995, when, at Trumpâ€™s invitation, he gave a speech at   . Years later on Twitter, Trump would ascribe Willâ€™s harsh view of him to Willâ€™s having â€œtotally bombedâ€ with his performance that night. Will told me: â€œHe started telling this story: â€˜The reason Will doesnâ€™t like me is I invited him to give a speech at    and I knew it was going to be boring, so I waited out on the patio.â€™ Which raises two questions. First, if he knew it was going to be that boring, why did he invite me? And second, who would be the guy with the orange hair sitting in the front row?â€ Will said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€ in 2012 that Trump was â€œa bloviating ignoramusâ€ and he has spent much of the past year predicting the candidateâ€™s imminent political demise. â€œI thought even an entertaining bore could be a bore after a while,â€ he told me. By late December of last year, however, his contempt had given way to alarm. â€œConservativesâ€™ highest priority,â€ he wrote in a Post column, â€œmust be to prevent Trump from winning the Republican nominationâ€  â€”   even if it meant Hillary Clintonâ€™s election. Then on June 2, three weeks after his dinner party for Cruz, Will learned that his friend and fellow Republican Paul Ryan, the House speaker, had endorsed the nominee. Will considered the matter over martinis at home that evening. The next morning, he walked into his office and told his assistant: â€œGo change my registration. This is not my party anymore. â€ Recently I visited Will at his office, a   Georgetown brick rowhouse erected in 1811. Its walls are covered with framed photographs, several of them depicting the writer in his youth alongside Reagan and other titans of his former party. The dean of conservative pundits, now 75, wore a crisp pinstripe shirt and gray slacks, his customary owlish Mona Lisa expression a bit tighter than usual, owing to the subject matter. Will told me that he cast his first vote in 1964, for Barry Goldwater. He voted for the Republican candidate in every succeeding presidential election, until now. â€œI donâ€™t use the word â€˜frighteningâ€™ often,â€ he told me. â€œBut itâ€™s frightening to know this personâ€  â€”   Trump  â€”   â€œwould have the   codes. The world is getting really dangerous. His friend Mr. Putin is dismantling a nation in the center of Europe. Some   captain of a Chinese boat with    missiles might make a mistake in the next three years near the Spratly Islands. All kinds of things can go wrong. And the idea that this guy will be asked to respond in a sober, firm way? My goodness. â€ He seemed genuinely despondent. â€œGiven that, could you see yourself urging your readers to vote for Hillary Clinton?â€ I asked. Willâ€™s lips pursed slightly. â€œWell,â€ he said, â€œitâ€™s clear from everything Iâ€™ve written that I think sheâ€™d be a better president. That said, Iâ€™m not going to vote for her. First of all, Iâ€™m a Maryland voter. She couldnâ€™t lose Maryland if she tried. â€ â€œThen. . .. â€ â€œI havenâ€™t decided,â€ he said. â€œYou can imagine  â€”   I get tons of emails: â€˜I, too, have left the Republican Party. What should I do?â€™ Well, there are a number of legitimate options. Not voting is a legitimate expression of opinion. â€ Ingraham and other conservative media personalities hailed Trump for having â€œtapped intoâ€ a shared and seething disquiet among predominantly white,    voters. â€œWhat I donâ€™t understand on the part of those being tapped into,â€ Will told me, â€œis: What exactly do they want? I can think of nothing the American people have wanted intensely and protractedly that they didnâ€™t get. Took a while, but they got it. â€ With a resigned   he looked at the ground and intoned, in the manner of a   monologue: â€œItâ€™s gonna be yuge. And itâ€™s all gonna get fixed. And weâ€™re all gonna be winners. â€ â€œIf he doesnâ€™t build that wall, Iâ€™m pissed,â€ Sean Hannity told me, reflecting on the prospects of a Trump presidency in the office of his radio show in Midtown Manhattan. â€œIf he doesnâ€™t repeal Obamacare, Iâ€™m gonna be pissed. If he appoints a liberal jurist to the Supreme Court, Iâ€™m gonna lose my mind. And by the way: Iâ€™ll be screaming. Not talking  â€”   screaming about it. But in fairness, if Trump doesnâ€™t keep his promises, you can also blame me, because I believed him. â€ Although Coulter was Trumpâ€™s earliest cheerleader among prominent   personalities, Hannityâ€™s stake in the election perhaps runs deepest of all, if only because of the size of his audience. He hosts the    show (after Limbaugh) on talk radio and the    program (after Bill Oâ€™Reilly and Megyn Kelly) on cable news. More than 2. 4 million weekly viewers and 13 million listeners have witnessed Hannity sticking his neck out on behalf of a   politician and sometime Republican who has voiced support for Planned Parenthood while vowing to limit Americaâ€™s military footprint and shred trade deals that the G. O. P. has backed for decades. Hannityâ€™s critics on the right have accused him of essentially running hourlong daily Trump infomercials. When I asked him about this, Hannity responded with a   litany of sins perpetrated by the Republican establishment in concert with Obama: perilously low labor participation and homeownership rates, soaring national debt, Obamacare and so on. A Clinton presidency, he warned, would be â€œObama on steroids. â€ These were his motivations. â€œMy conscience is clear. And I feel like Donald Trump would be a great president. â€ Hannity told me that he had in fact never stayed at a Trump hotel property, played on a Trump golf course or visited   . â€œI have my own place  â€”   on the other Florida coast, in Naples,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t need his place. I always got the sense people were asking him for something. I donâ€™t believe in asking for free stuff. â€ Nonetheless, the two men have a mutual affinity that has spanned at least two decades. The MSNBC â€œMorning Joeâ€ host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough theorized to me that their relationship has a psychological underpinning: â€œDonald Trump, Sean Hannity, Bill Oâ€™Reilly all share the same resentment that they will never be accepted into Manhattanâ€™s polite society no matter what they do. â€ (Trump is from Queens Hannity and Oâ€™Reilly are from Long Island.) Trump, in a recent phone conversation, offered me a somewhat simpler explanation: â€œSean likes having me on his show, and that has to do with ratings more than anything else. â€ No presidential candidate in history, Hannity told me, understands television better than Trump  â€”   â€œnot even close. â€ On this score, I couldnâ€™t disagree. One evening this past spring, on his plane after a campaign event in Buffalo, Trump told me that at rallies, he always made a point of finding the TV cameras at the back of the media pen and noticing whether a red light was flickering. â€œThat means theyâ€™re airing it live,â€ he explained. â€œSo I make sure to say something newâ€  â€”   by which he meant newsworthy, the better to own the next news cycle. Trump was a TV star for more than a decade before he became a politician he watches TV news incessantly and understands the medium intimately. He knows the optimal time slots on the morning shows. He   the   lighting. He is not only on speaking terms with every network chief executive but also knows their booking agents. He monitors the opinions of hosts and regular guests more avidly than most media critics do and works them obsessively, often directly. Scarborough told me that Trumpâ€™s family  â€”   particularly Ivanka Trumpâ€™s husband, Jared Kushner  â€”   sometimes asked him for advice, and more than once â€œcalled me and asked me to get him off the ledge. Iâ€™ve said, â€˜I can do that, but six hours later heâ€™s going to revert to form.â€™ I told Jared at one point: â€˜Jared, your    listens to me more when Iâ€™m attacking him on television than when Iâ€™m trying to convince him to be rational for the sake of the party.â€™ I think heâ€™s a creature of TV. â€ TV networks, in the mainstream as well as conservative media, have profited handsomely from Trumpâ€™s   theatrics, but some of their   personalities like Hannity are drawn to him for reasons apart from ratings. The prospect of getting in on the ground floor of a Trump administration that is short on policy ideas and disdainful of old Washington hands amounts to a     opportunity. By employing the Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, and by including both Ingraham and Roger Ailes in his debate preparations, Trump has implicitly encouraged the conservative media to consider itself part of the campaign team. I asked Hannity if it was true that, as a Trump confidant had told me, he wished to be considered as a potential Trump White House chief of staff. â€œThatâ€™s news to me,â€ he insisted, adding a politicianâ€™s practiced nondenial denial: â€œI have radio and TV contracts that I will honor through December 2020. â€ Nonetheless, Hannityâ€™s service to the Trump campaign well exceeds that of ritually bashing Clinton and giving Trump free airtime. He has offered private strategic advice to the campaign. The same Trump confidant told me of at least one instance in which Hannity drafted an unsolicited memo outlining the message Trump should offer after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. In public, Hannity has made it his mission to warn fellow conservatives  â€”   naming names, like the columnist Jonah Goldberg and the National Review editor in chief Rich Lowry  â€”   that if they do not soon climb aboard the Trump train they will, as the hashtag threatens, #OwnIt: Clintonâ€™s picks for the Supreme Court, her response to the Islamic State, her trade deals, all of it. Hannity maintains that his scolding of Trumpâ€™s conservative dissenters derives from his fear of a Clinton presidency. â€œItâ€™d be pretty much over,â€ he said. Taken alone, George Will or even National Review might have little impact on Trumpâ€™s standing in the race, Hannity argued, but â€œcumulatively they do. I can look at the poll numbers. If you go back to a month ago, he was garnering 73 percent of the Republican vote. The most recent, I think he had 88 percent. He needs to get to 93. â€ And the key to the last 5 percent might very well lie with the noisy holdouts, like Erick Erickson. On Sept. 16, Erickson showed up at the National Press Club in Washington to participate in a debate sponsored by the National Religious Broadcasters. Erickson left RedState at the end of last year to concentrate on his radio show and his online opinion journal, The Resurgent, but he has remained influential among conservatives who do not support Trump. In July, when he learned that Ted Cruz was about to have a private meeting with the nominee on the eve of the convention, Erickson texted the senator: â€œDonâ€™t endorse! Donâ€™t endorse!â€ Later that evening, Erickson says, Cruz texted back: â€œDidnâ€™t endorse! Didnâ€™t endorse!â€ (Cruz finally announced that he would vote for Trump on Sept. 23.) The subject of the debate, inevitably, was Trump: specifically, whether evangelical Christians should support him. Being a lifelong evangelical himself, Erickson had some thoughts on the matter. Over the years, he had been condemned for his own offensive words, like the time he called the Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis â€œAbortion Barbie. â€ But he had recently apologized for many (though not all) of these statements and had called upon Trump to affect a similar posture of Christian humility. â€œ1 Corinthians is very explicit,â€ he told me. â€œIf someone holds oneâ€™s self out to be a Christian and doesnâ€™t behave th"

21124,"Is This Heaven? No, Itâ€™s Cleveland - The New York Times",John Hyduk,"CLEVELAND  â€”   On a warm June night in Cleveland, 20, 562 pairs of hands gathered to lift a curse. Quicken Loans Arena, home of the Cavaliers, was hosting an official Game 7 watch party. The place was gussied up in    banners proclaiming, â€œALL IN. â€ In fact, most things were all out. The $5 tickets for the 20, 562 indoor seats sold out in less than a minute a like number of admissions for the outdoor plaza were also gobbled up in under a minute. The chosen ones (apologies, LeBron) shuffled past their ticketless brethren in an approximation of the Last Judgment, marching toward not the Pearly Gates but the Gateway Plaza security. â€œAnybody got a ticket to sell?â€ a tattooed man said. â€œOne ticket?â€ Inside, your   Ahmad and Nicole, a   couple, took over the Humongotron. â€œThe   scoreboard has four enormous HD video screens that are tilted and uniquely curved to provide optimal viewing angles for all fansâ€ is the way the Qâ€™s website described it, and the Big H, replete with flaming sabers, could barely contain Ahmadâ€™s enthusiasm. â€œItâ€™s Game 7 of the N. B. A. finals with the Golden State Warriorsâ€  â€”   we boo  â€”   â€œgoing against YOUR Cleveland Cavaliers!â€ High in the rafters  â€”   the uppermost stretches of the Q are dubbed Loudville  â€”   Nicole cornered Mark, a young fan. She asked what his plans were after the Cavs won. Markâ€™s eyes went saucers, as if the thought had never really occurred to him. Then the Humongotron filled with pregame   live from Oakland. There was LeBron Jamesâ€™s face, broad and as impassive as the Sphinx. And the building lost its collective mind. Is this heaven? No, itâ€™s Cleveland. â€œDo not engage in any fighting or throwing of objects,â€ the   announcer reminded us. â€œViolators will be ejected and subject to arrest. â€ Itâ€™s not easy being CLE. In most cities, sports failure is an occasional painful lesson in Cleveland, it has been the entire point. Futility here turned into an annual ritual: The (insert franchise name here) would start the season with high hopes, lose much of their steam via poor   play and horrible   miscalculations (see Johnny Football) and reload with a new crop of talent, only to reprise the outcome. The Cavs had seemingly followed the script, left for dead after the fourth game of the championship series as assorted talking heads proclaimed that no team had ever come back from a   series deficit. Believeland would have none of it. â€œCavs all the way,â€ Laurie Coduto said. Her husband, Mike, agreed. â€œYou know the Cavs are going to win,â€ he said. The Codutos were here Sunday night because â€œwe want to be part of history,â€ Laurie said. The music kicked in. Billy Idol was singing â€œRebel Yell. â€ Or it could have been â€œWhite Wedding. â€ Heck, it could have been Pachelbelâ€™s â€œToccata in E Minor. â€ No matter. It was the moment, and the moment is what set the wheelchairs in the Subway Fan Zone to dancing. A trio of young men passed, laden with enough nachos for a week in the North Woods. â€œFollow me,â€ one said. â€œKnow where youâ€™re going?â€ â€œNo. â€ You knew by the time of the player introductions that something was different. As the lights dimmed, and just before the Humongotron belched fire, a fan waved a sign: â€œLeBron the Real M. V. P. â€ Maybe. The Warriors closed the half strong. Draymond Green ignited an   run in the final four minutes of the second quarter, and Golden State took a   lead into the locker room. No matter. â€œThe Cavs are going to win,â€ said a woman who gave her name as Ophelia. Calm in the storm, she was here â€œto be part of the excitement. â€ The elite craziness took place in deeper waters. The Cleveland Indiansâ€™ afternoon game against the Chicago White Sox provided the undercard, and Tribe fans wandered over from the ballpark to join the throng outside. The vibe was Spring Break North the dress  â€”   what there was of it  â€”   was casual, the conversation livelier. â€œDid you get him anything for Fatherâ€™s Day?â€ a young woman asked her friend. â€œWho says heâ€™s the father?â€ her friend answered, not looking up from her drink. Nearby, another young woman lectured a boy. â€œDonâ€™t play for a team,â€ she scolded. â€œBe a lawyer and own the team. â€ She added, â€œI dated a lawyer, and I should know. â€ The boy was about 2 years old and tiny, riding on his fatherâ€™s shoulders. Dad and son quickly moved away. With 1 minute 50 seconds left in the game, James uncoiled a   block of an Andre Iguodala shot. Kyrie Irving hit a   shot over Stephen Curry. Curry answered with a wildly errant   attempt on the other end before James was fouled hard. He knocked down the second of two free throws for a   Cleveland lead with 10 seconds on the clock. Chants of â€œM. V. P. !â€ rocked the Q. Please, no more about the Curse. Suffice to say, the Cavs put up a season that any thinking sports fan ought to have been proud to witness. Cleveland has beaten flawed teams, like Atlanta, and it has beaten young rosters just coming into their own, like Detroit and Toronto. The Cavs are smarter than any team thatâ€™s tougher, and there arenâ€™t many of those. It could be argued, while listening to Wiz Khalifa rattle your molars, that sport has sucked the charm out of the contemporary game and replaced it with volume. Marketing is a simple villain. Hunger for karmic justice, and they will offer you a discounted hot dog. Shiver in the cold rain of a   of disappointment, and they will hand you a FirstEnergy  . That is the way the game is played now. It is easy to overlook the obvious even when it is flashed onto a video screen the size of an apartment building. The real power lies inside, coiled and remarkable. It always has. It is what causes the granny during the Irving   to chair dance to mad beats. It is what causes the beanpole wearing a Matthew Dellavedova jersey as a belly shirt to lean to his left to misguide a Curry free throw, even if the hoop in question is 2, 200 miles away. And yes, it is what turns every â€œBrian on a car phoneâ€ into James Naismith this time of year. No maybes here. Weâ€™re going to win. Not â€œtheyâ€ or â€œI. â€ In the end, the Cavs played like a team with a chip on its shoulder, winning for a city full of people with a chip on theirs. Which brings us back to Mark, pondering a course of action for the final buzzer. â€œIâ€™m going to go running in the street,â€ he said. It was a beautiful summer night, a gentle breeze finally coming over a Great Lake, past the glass pyramid of the Rock â€™nâ€™ Roll Hall of Fame. The Cavs were champs. A spell had been lifted without crystals, roosters or the intercession of Madame Zora. And there was nothing left to do except join 20, 562 of your closest friends and run in the street."

Setting aside Judicial Watchâ€™s lawsuit against the State Department, Hillary Clinton almost looked to be in the clear a few months back, but now her email shenanigans have returned to the front pages, all because of Weinerâ€™s compulsion to send vulgar selfies online.

Sure, be angry at him for the way heâ€™s treated his wife and the women heâ€™s sexted, but there would be no sensitive emails on his laptop if Hillary and company had simply used the secure government email accounts provided to them.

21127,"Panicked Borrowers, and the Education Departmentâ€™s Unsettling Silence - The New York Times",Ron Lieber,"It was bad enough late last month when the Education Department, in a legal filing, informed the nationâ€™s public servants that they shouldnâ€™t trust its administratorâ€™s word about whether their student loans qualify for its debt forgiveness program. But the panic among borrowers that the newfound uncertainty unleashed helps illuminate an additional problem with the public service loan forgiveness program: Many people who believe that they qualify  â€”   and entered graduate school, borrowed piles of money and chose employers accordingly  â€”   may not realize that they are not making qualifying payments or that certain loans are not eligible for forgiveness. The program, which began in 2007, was enacted with what was supposed to be a   proposition: People who worked for 10 years in public service jobs and made regular payments would have the remainder of their federal student loans forgiven. A wide variety of jobs were supposed to qualify, from nonprofit work to teaching in a public school or practicing medicine at a public hospital. But now, 10 years later, the legal filing has sown all manner of confusion  â€”   which itself comes in the wake of a disheartening amount of misdirection given to borrowers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau receives plenty of complaints about loan servicers offering incorrect information. And   employers may also pass along bad advice. â€œThis is one of the most complex programs ever concocted by Congress,â€ said Rohit Chopra, a former Education Department employee who also served as the student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. â€œSo many people who are counting on getting some help are going to be flatly rejected on a technicality. â€ People who are in the loan forgiveness program, who think they are or who are contemplating trying to enter it ought to use this scare as an opportunity to step back and   their assumptions. At least four basic things need to happen for someone to get in the program and stay in: He or she must make payments in the right way, have the right kind of employer, be in the right loan category and have the right kind of payment plan. What follows is a mere summary, and the pitfalls, tripwires and exceptions are legion. Mandatory additional reading includes the Education Departmentâ€™s fact sheet, its list of 56 questions and answers, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauâ€™s tool kits for employers and employees. Letâ€™s take those four requirements in order: THE RIGHT WAY TO PAY For starters, you need to make 120 payments in order to qualify. They need to be made on time and in full, and you must be working full time. The count can get complicated for people in school, or just getting out, or in financial trouble, as well as for those with qualifying undergraduate loans who go back to school. Question 21 on the departmentâ€™s list addresses some of these issues. THE RIGHT KIND OF EMPLOYER This is what the lawsuit is about. All of the Education Departmentâ€™s guidance on the topic suggests that people who work for the government or for a nonprofit with 501( c) 3 status should be eligible for forgiveness. Anyone who wants to be certain that an employer qualifies can (and should) file an employment certification form with a loan servicer. Do it every year, and every time you change jobs or servicers. Also check to make sure your payments are going correctly toward that goal of 120. The lawsuit involved some employers with more esoteric nonprofit statuses, and the Education Departmentâ€™s filing in response declared that approval of an employment certification form â€œdoes not reflect agency action on the borrowerâ€™s qualificationsâ€ for the public service loan forgiveness program. Additionally, the brief said that borrowers should not expect a truly final decision until after their 120 payments were made. Cross your fingers, everybody! And cue the justifiable panic. Dr. Jordan   33, an emergency room physician at a nonprofit hospital in New York City, fired off a letter to the Education Department demanding final word now about the fate of his more than $300, 000 in student loans. While he had previously received letters saying that his employer qualified, he was primed to be wary. At one point, his human resources person mistakenly told him that his hospital might not qualify. â€œI was going to throw up,â€ he said. Jessica Schreiber, 28, the founder and sole paid employee of a nonprofit, has her own concerns. She left New York Cityâ€™s Sanitation Department last year to start Fabscrap, which helps local businesses recycle their fabric. Before starting graduate school, she plotted her loans, payments and career choices according to the rules of the loan forgiveness program. So when she heard the news about the lawsuit, she posted the following on Facebook: â€œTHIS IS TERRIFYING. â€ She has asked for her servicerâ€™s blessing on the eligibility of her nonprofit, and has not heard back yet. Since the legal filing, the Education Department has told reporters that it cannot comment on pending litigation. I didnâ€™t ask about that. Instead, I simply asked if its servicerâ€™s letters about whether an employer was eligible were something that borrowers should believe. Its three spokesmen did not answer by my deadline for this article. Letâ€™s call the Education Departmentâ€™s refusal to clarify the matter exactly what it is: meanness. If the department has made mistakes with the litigants and misclassified their employers, it can fix them quickly and settle the suit without freaking out untold numbers of other borrowers. THE RIGHT KIND OF LOAN The Education Departmentâ€™s instructions, via another information page on its website, are pretty clear: You need to have what the agency refers to as a â€œdirectâ€ loan. As the site explains, if the word â€œdirectâ€ isnâ€™t in the title of your loan, it probably doesnâ€™t qualify. If you arenâ€™t sure what kinds of loans you have or whether your statement from your servicer describes them correctly, you can log into the departmentâ€™s website and look them up. If youâ€™re making payments on, say, a Federal Family Education Loan (F. F. E. L.) or a Perkins loan, those are not counted toward your 120 payments, even if you work for a qualifying employer (though the Perkins loan has its own cancellation program). You can fix this by consolidating your loans into a direct consolidation loan. Be careful, though: If you consolidate direct loans with nonqualifying loans, any   payments you made on that old direct loan wonâ€™t count anymore. The count to 120 resets. When Dr. Darius Amjadi, a    pathologist and Iraq war veteran in Portland, Ore. began his work with a veteransâ€™ hospital, he thought he had a shot at loan forgiveness from the Veterans Affairs Departmentâ€™s own program. At the same time, his employer informed him that his loans would be eligible for public service loan forgiveness. But the departmentâ€™s forgiveness has not come through. And it turns out he had not been in the right kind of federal loan to qualify for forgiveness under the public service program, despite what his employer said. â€œIf anyone had said, â€˜Check your loans,â€™ it would have put me on notice,â€ Dr. Amjadi said. Now, heâ€™s got a balance of $40, 000 and has missed out on years of eligibility for forgiveness. THE RIGHT KIND OF PAYMENTS This is the category that so worries Mr. Chopra, the former Education Department and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau student loan expert, who is now a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. For starters, he points out that if you are not in some kind of   repayment program (check the Education Departmentâ€™s website for the names of all of the different ones) youâ€™re not going to benefit from forgiveness and thereâ€™s a good chance that your payments donâ€™t qualify. A standard repayment term for student loans is 10 years, or 120 payments. Those payments may be technically eligible if you have the right employer, but if youâ€™re making them in full (and not on an   plan) youâ€™ll have paid off the loan in 10 years and there wonâ€™t be any loan left to forgive. Mr. Chopra worries about people working for eligible employers and making payments in something called graduated or extended repayment plans that are not income driven. If you think that sounds like you, call your servicer and ask, then ask again at a different time to be sure. He points to data in an Education Department presentation from late last year that is available online showing that about half of the people enrolled in public service loan forgiveness have not made a single payment that qualifies toward their goal of 120. He suspects that many just donâ€™t realize theyâ€™re in the wrong kinds of payment plans. My inquiries to the Education Department about this matter yielded no replies. To review, weâ€™ve promised to help our public servants by forgiving their student loan payments after a decade. But the program is confusing, the governmentâ€™s legal filings contradict its websites, and its representatives arenâ€™t answering questions. This is no way to treat the people who do some of the most important work in our country. But itâ€™s also yet another reminder that as we build more complexity into our financial systems, weâ€™re sending the message to those who must navigate them that they are on their own. Itâ€™s a shameful message at any time, but itâ€™s particularly galling when itâ€™s firefighters, librarians and nurses on the receiving end."
21128,An English Soccer Club Turns Fantasy Sports Into Reality - The New York Times,Jack Williams,"At first glance, the sideline of a United London F. C. home game features exactly what one would expect from an   soccer match on a rented field in Englandâ€™s capital. Water bottles. A collection of balls. Substitutes warming up. A crowd that United Londonâ€™s chairman, Mark North, describes as â€œone man and his dog. â€ What is missing is more notable: a manager. At United London F. C. the position of a traditional coach is unnecessary. Instead, the lineup is selected by the teamâ€™s fans each week. Formed this year and currently playing in the Essex Alliance Premier League  â€”   the 12th tier of Englandâ€™s competitive soccer pyramid  â€”   United London F. C. claims to be the worldâ€™s only managerless club. In place of a traditional coach, the teamâ€™s business model brings together elements of reality TV voting and player analytics similar to those used in video games and by scouts. It employs a fantasy   system that awards points to or deducts points from the teamâ€™s fans (acting individually as managers) based on whether their selections make the starting 11, score or record an assist, or play a role in posting a shutout. â€œIn nonleague football, thereâ€™s not much in the way of eyeballs, because the Premier League just takes over everything,â€ North, 38, said. â€œThatâ€™s where we want to be different, in that we are building an online fan base, rather than a localized one. â€ To date, more than 2, 000 people have signed up with the club, which played its first competitive match in early September. The team claims support from fans in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Sweden and the United States. Each week, those fans vote on United Londonâ€™s starting lineup by reviewing player statistics, scouting reports and videos of previous weeksâ€™ matches posted online by the club. After voting closes each Friday, the squad for Saturdayâ€™s match is announced. â€œI think itâ€™s cool because it keeps the clubâ€™s supporters involved,â€ said John Frusciante, a    from Aberdeen, N. J. who recently signed up. â€œThe fans have more input than, say, at Real Madrid. Zidane isnâ€™t going to ask you if Ronaldo should be starting or notâ€  â€”   as in Coach Zinedine Zidane and striker Cristiano Ronaldo. North said the idea behind the team came to him last year while he and his wife were watching TV on a Saturday night. Tired of ballroom dancing shows and singing contests, North, who worked in financial recruitment at the time, began devising ways to apply the reality TV voting model to soccer. Like the contestants on such shows, players for United London have something at stake in each weekâ€™s voting. While researching how to find players for a   team, North realized he might be able to mine the large number of academy prospects that are released by English professional clubs each season. After this highly competitive annual cull, many players abandon their hopes of professional soccer, around age 18. United London has positioned itself as a second chance for such players the clubâ€™s badge depicts a phoenix rising from flames. â€œA lot of players, by the time they get to 18, 19, 20, they havenâ€™t got a rÃ©sumÃ©,â€ said Jon Willis, the head of recruitment at the Football Careers Centre, an organization that helps place former academy players with new clubs. He helped organize United London F. C.â€™s summer trials. Willis said United London allowed players to reset their career path, or try to attract the attention of a new club. â€œThis program is interesting,â€ Willis said, â€œbecause they record every game. Itâ€™s going to put people in the shop window. â€ Already, United London F. C. has created a diverse squad of     and even   among them a Turkish youth international a player who, the club claims, was the   soccer player in Britain last year and the nephew of an England international striker. â€œRight now, I donâ€™t really think about it,â€ Georges Ketoka, who once played in the third tier of Belgian soccer, said of fansâ€™ having the power to pick, or cut, players. At 26, Ketoka is one of the teamâ€™s oldest members. â€œIf you play,â€ he said, â€œyou know itâ€™s because people like you, the way you play and what you bring to the team. â€ For now, United London supporters can influence the teamâ€™s lineup only before matches. On a   website  â€”   North admitted that it had had some growing pains  â€”   fans are met with a formation empty of players that they can fill by selecting names from   menus beneath each position. Clicking on a star above a player selects him as the captain, earning the manager double points for that playerâ€™s performance. As technology improves, North said, the club would like to allow fans to make   decisions on substitutions and other questions. For now, those decisions, and practice sessions, are handled by United London staff members. North would not reveal how many of those     are active users. The reason, he said, is that knowing such information could allow him and his staff to manipulate voting for the players they prefer. However, North did joke that results so far had shown that he was perhaps not the best person to be making such decisions anyway. His role at the club includes   tasks like putting up the nets before matches, but he also sits down every Sunday to count every pass, tackle and shot from the previous dayâ€™s match, so that fans have the information they need to vote during the week ahead. That has not lent him much of an insider advantage, though, when he picks his own lineup. Last week, he said: â€œI was only ranked seventh  â€”   some guy from Sweden was top of the leaderboard. And I should know everyone!â€"

21130,War With the Comanche,AR Staff,"War With the Comanche Duncan Hengest, American Renaissance, July 2010 
Fort Sill, north of Lawton, Oklahoma, is home to the Armyâ€™s Field Artillery School as well as many field artillery brigades. Over the decades, thousands of Americans have learned how to crew cannon there, and I am one of them. A posting to Fort Sill allowed me to explore what remains of the Wild West when I was off duty. Iâ€™d always been a fan of Westerns and of the real history of Americaâ€™s pioneering conquest of the continent, and the Lawton area was and is the center of Comanche territory. 
During the early days of the Texas Republic, the Comanche were the worldâ€™s best light cavalry. In fact, they were such fantastic fighters that the Spanish never even tried to subdue them, and the Comanche halted the expansion of settlements into the panhandle and northern Texas for nearly 50 years. Yet the Comanche today are a pitiful group, the defeated remnants of a terrible racial conflict. 
Everywhere you go in Lawton, you see obese Indians. In Oklahoma each tribe has its own license plates, so you can tell a personâ€™s tribe by watching him get into his car. (I tried to get a license plate that said â€œComancheâ€ but the DMV would not give me one.) Sometimes it seems as though all the Comanche are unhealthy; the white manâ€™s diet does not seem suited to a people adapted to living on game from the North American prairie. When the Comanche get sick they go to the Public Health Service Indian Hospital at the eastern end of Lawton. If you drive by you are likely to see ancient Indians â€” poor and disheveled â€” holding out their thumbs for a ride. Their hands tremble. 
It seems that the Comanche are as badly adapted to the white manâ€™s economy as to his diet. I once watched a heavy Comanche woman slowly pushing pennies towards a white cashier. She carefully slid each coin across the counter as though it was very difficult to part with. 
The Comancheâ€™s misery is the result of their absolute defeat during a fierce conflict with whites in the 19th Century. The Comanche War, as that conflict has come to be known, was lengthy and cruel. This terrible war that cursed both the Indians and the Americans was largely inherent in their circumstances; different races and cultures, especially aggressive ones, should not try to share the same territory. 
Always against us 
The name Comanche is a Spanish corruption of the Ute word Kohmahts , meaning enemy, stranger, or those who are always against us. Like many tribes, the Comanche called themselves simply â€œthe people,â€ or Numunuh in their own language. They are an offshoot of the Shoshone, who hail from the area of todayâ€™s southern Idaho. Sometime during the 1500s, they left the mountain northwest and settled in southwest Oklahoma. There, they acquired horses from the Spanish, and began to dominate the high plains of western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and Eastern New Mexico. This vast territory was well watered and its grasslands fed the Comancheâ€™s horses, endless herds of buffalo, and other smaller game. With the horse, the Comanche could travel rapidly on the planes, and easily kill buffalo. 
In the mountain Northwest, the Comanche had been a poor, foot-bound people; with the horse they became lords of the western plains. Their population exploded. There was no census, but estimates of their numbers vary from 10 to 30 thousand. As they grew more powerful, they started raiding their neighbors. They raided the Apache and Pueblo in Arizona and New Mexico, and the Pawnee in Eastern Kansas. They traded with the Spaniards around Santa Fe but also raided settlements in Mexico and Texas. They often took captives in Mexico and ransomed them back to traders in Santa Fe for finished goods. Neither the Spanish Empire nor the Mexican Republic had the means to stop this well-organized piracy. 
Despite constant raiding, some time around 1790 the Comanche made a lasting alliance with the Kiowa. Like the Comanche, the Kiowa had come from the mountain Northwest, moved into the southern plains, and acquired the horse. The Kiowa and Comanche spoke different languages, but lived in a very similar manner. The Kiowa were a much smaller tribe, and perhaps they fitted into a special niche: not worth raiding and too small to be a threat, but useful allies. This alliance between two extremely warlike people held year after year. The two tribes raided together so consistently that Comanche raids were often Comanche-and-Kiowa raids. 
The Comanche came to the attention of Americans when Texas became free of Mexico. Shortly after independence, in 1838, the new republic signed its first peace treaty with the Comanche â€” a treaty that was probably doomed from the start. It was made with only one Comanche band, it did not define a boundary between Texas and Comanche lands, and it was never ratified by the Texas Senate. Essentially it required that the Comanche stop attacking whites â€” a not unreasonable demand â€” and some Comanche may have intended to abide by it. However, the Republic of Texas was a young, independent state with relatively wealthy white newcomers living in isolated settlements. They were irresistible targets for raiders, and the treaty was soon broken. 
Comanche raids were striking examples of military precision and stealth. Raiding parties could number up to 1,500, and could move undetected across the grassland. Attacks on this scale had proven brilliantly successful against traditional Comanche targets: larger villages of mostly unarmed Mexicans or other Indians. These villages had no way to fight off the Comanche or pursue them as they retreated. 
Raiders were most active during the full moon, when they could see at night. The waxing of the moon became a source of dread for Texas whites, who began to call the full moon a â€œComanche moon.â€ When they sacked Texas farmhouses they usually killed the men and captured the youngsters and women. Comanche women often tortured and mutilated older girls and women to make them less attractive. The women also took the lead in torturing men. They might cut the skin off their feet, tie them to a horse, and make them walk behind until they collapsed and were dragged to death. 
By 1840, just two years after the treaty, relations between whites and Comanche were murderous and getting worse by the day. In March, the Texas government sent Colonel Henry W. Karnes at the head of a group to meet a delegation of Comanche chiefs at the San Antonio Council House. Karnes was charged with recovering Texas captives and trying to improve relations. The Texans estimated that the Comanche held some 200 captives, and promised that their return would be taken as a gesture of goodwill. 
The meeting went badly. The Comanche arrived with only one of the promised captives, a young girl whose nose had been burned off. She was badly bruised from beatings, and said she had been repeatedly gang-raped. Texan soldiers, who were already angry over the raids and the broken treaty, killed the chiefs outright. Other whites opened fire on the Comanche who were outside the courthouse. 
To the Comanche, the Council House slaughter was treachery of the lowest sort. What the Texans considered savagery â€” raiding, torture, and slaughter of captives â€” were to them the normal practices of war. From this mutual incomprehension, and from the slaughter of the chiefs, the seeds of long-term hatred were planted. The Comanche never forgave the Texans. Throughout the decades they were pillaging Texas, Comanche could have raided Kansas â€” it was no farther away than many parts of Texas â€” but they saved their wrath for Texas. 
The Comanche did not wait long for revenge. In early August they launched a massive attack on the coastal towns of Victoria and Linnville. In Victoria, the local militia, often called â€œMinutemen,â€ managed to drive off the attackers. They fired from inside buildings, and the Comanche, unused to city fighting, retreated. At Linnville, the raiders killed some 20 residents; the others survived only by boarding ships and moving just off shore, where they watched as the Comanche burned the town to the ground. Linnville never rebuilt, and the area is now a residential part of Calhoun County. 
Linnville and Victoria are hundreds of miles from the center of Comanche territory in Oklahoma, and the attacks demonstrate the extraordinary reach and mobility the raiders enjoyed. At that time, the Comanche often hunted and camped in territory as far south as Austin. The barbed wire fence had yet to be invented, so there was little to stop them. Indeed, Texans had settled only the eastern and coastal parts of the state, so the coast was well within range of inland tribes. 
The warfare that began with the council house killings and the revenge raids on Linnville and Victoria lasted until the late 1870s, and this nearly 40-year war can be divided into three stages. The first, which lasted until Texas joined the Union in 1845, pitted the Comanche against locally-organized whites supported by a Texas government that was highly sympathetic to them. The second, from 1845 until 1861, was much like the Cold War in that the federal government contained the Comanche but did not destroy their ability to make war. In the last stage of the conflict, after the Civil War, a vindictive Reconstruction government ignored bloody and repeated Comanche attacks on disarmed whites and supported the Comanche through a myriad of welfare and reform policies. Only after the post-Civil War elite was directly threatened did it take action, permanently ending the Comanche threat in 1879. 
Texans strike back 
Immediately after the great raids on Linnville and Victoria, the Texans called out the militia and assembled Ranger companies, and defeated the retreating Comanche force at the Battle of Plum Creek on August 14, 1840. The Comanche were slowed by the burden of their loot from Linnville, and also faced an enemy that was better armed and organized than their earlier Indian and Mexican antagonists. Since the 1830s, Texas Rangers had carried six-shooter revolvers as well as long rifles. The Comanche were still mostly armed with bows and arrows as well as lances, and usually retreated on their fast horses in the face of sustained gunfire. When the mounted Rangers could catch them, they would ride next to the Indians and inflict terrible losses with their six-shooters. 
Another important ingredient in subsequent successes against the Comanche was the leadership of the dynamic and aggressive Texas president, Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar. Lamar was a Georgian who had moved to Texas to escape disappointments in his career and personal life. He fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Mexican Army was defeated and Texas won independence. The Texas constitution allowed for a single presidential term in office, and Lamar was elected to succeed Sam Houston. One of the new presidentâ€™s first challenges was the Comanche. As he put it, â€œThe fierce and perfidious savages are waging upon our exposed and defenseless inhabitants, an un-provoked and cruel warfare, masacreing [sic] the women and children, and threatening the whole line of our unprotected borders with speedy desolation.â€ 
After the victory at Plum Creek, Lamar began a policy of retaliatory raids on villages in the Comanche sanctuary in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma. Colonel John H. Moore, accompanied by Lipan Indian scouts, led the initial foray. The Rangers moved on an area that is now Colorado City, Texas, and the Lipans discovered a village with little security. Moore sent a detachment to cover a likely escape route, and ordered the main body of his command to attack. He caught the Comanche by surprise and killed 50 in the village. The ambush detachment killed another 80 retreating Indians. The killing was somewhat indiscriminate and included women and children. Mooreâ€™s tactics of attack and ambush were duplicated by the Rangers, and later, by the US cavalry. 
(Interestingly, this was the same basic plan George Custer used at Little Big Horn in 1876. The difference was that the Sioux village was massive. The Indians also had lever-action rifles and pinned down the ambush detachment while sending a larger force to overwhelm the 7th Cavalryâ€™s main attack. Custer never had a chance.) 
Lamar saw the conflict as a race war, and made no secret of his desire to rid the state of all Indian tribes. He probably would have exterminated the Comanche if he could have, but took different measures against less war-like tribes. His administration pointedly sent no aid when diseases swept through Indian territory. He began the process that moved the Cherokee, Caddo, and Tonkowa onto reservations in Oklahoma, but once they were settled peacefully, he never harried them. 
Against the Comanche, Lamar developed both defensive and offensive strategies. The Rangersâ€™ ability to defeat large groups prevented the Comanche from forming large raiding parties, and the Minutemen in the Texas settlements â€” almost like local crime watches â€” defended against smaller raids. The system was not perfect, but the raids became smaller and less frequent. Rangers also continued to maul Comanche villages. As T. R. Fehrenbach wrote in his definitive Comanche: A History of a People , there were many retaliatory actions â€œno one bothered to report.â€ 
Part of the tragedy of the war is that although the Comanche had raided for generations, they had never faced an opponent like the Texans and did not understand them. Spaniards and Mexicans were disorganized prey, and could not mount a full-scale defense. Nor did they have a militia to call out. The Comanche assumed that white men were like themselves, loosely organized bands for whom an offence against one was not an insult to all. Texans saw things differently, and united against what they considered a threat to the entire state. 
Until they took on the Texans, the Comanche had always been safe from reprisal raids, so for them, the war was over when the raiding party came home. The Texans were different. Months after a raid, they would surprise an offending â€” or completely innocent â€” Comanche village and put it to the torch. Also, Comanche movements were limited by the seasons and buffalo hunts, whereas the Texans could campaign any time of year. By the end of Lamarâ€™s administration a generation of Comanche warriors was dead. T.R. Fehrenbach estimates that from 1838 to 1840, a quarter of the braves had been killed, most of them in the actions following the Council House fight. 
What saved the Comanche and kept the war alive were larger questions of geopolitics. The Texans were going broke. The countryâ€™s finances were unsound, and the Comanche campaign was just one of several conflicts Lamar had to finance. There were constant Mexican incursions, and Lamar even sent troops into Mexico at great expense. The United States was receptive to annexation, so Texas joined the Union in 1845. The expensive Ranger companies were cut back and federal troops took over their job. At first, the Army sent only infantry to forts along the frontier, and they could not stop the Comanche from moving freely over the prairies. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis formed a cavalry regiment to send to Texas, which managed to prevent some raiding. Its efforts were helped by a cholera epidemic the â€œForty-ninersâ€ brought when they crossed the plains during the Gold Rush. It is estimated that the Comanche population dropped from 20,000 to 12,000 during this time. 
Whites began to push the internal Texas frontier forward. The east and south were settled by then, but the north and west â€” where Wichita Falls and Amarillo are today â€” were still raw frontier. With the Comanche more or less under control, white settlers began to fill the empty parts of the state. 
By 1860, the Comanche were on the defensive â€” reduced by plague and harried by the US Cavalry. Their final defeat would have been just a matter of time, but the Civil War changed the balance of power. The federal troops left, and Confederate forces went East. The pressure lifted, and midway through the war the Comanche started raiding again. They went back to their old ways of rape, plunder, and torture, but with a new twist. They soon found they could steal Texas cattle and trade them with Comancheros â€” Hispanic traders in the Rio Grande Valley â€” for lever-action rifles. The Texans lost the advantage in firepower they had always enjoyed. The Comanche had always been able to get a few modern weapons, but massive industrial production and increasing trade made them much easier to get. 
The Texas Reconstruction government therefore inherited a new Comanche war that was blowing with a terrible fury, but did not take it seriously. The carpetbag elite was less interested in fighting Indians than in enriching itself at local expense and supporting the newly freed blacks. Things only got worse as the 1860s wore on, and T.R. Fehrenbach writes that by 1870, â€œlong-settled regions were regressing toward depopulation. Only hundreds of settlers were being killed, but meanwhile thousands were deserting the frontier. The panic was very real.â€ The frontier retreated â€” an early form of white flight â€” as farmers left their properties for safer areas. Those who stayed behind turned their haciendas into fortresses. The effect was to hold back growth; the panhandle could not be settled until the 1880s. Lyndon Baines Johnsonâ€™s ancestors were among those the Comanche harried. 
Even as the Comanche were murdering white homesteaders, the government attempted a sanctuary, welfare buy-off, faith-based assimilation program that is reminiscent of modern times. During the final Comanche War from 1865 to 1879, Texas whites were disarmed by the Reconstruction government, and prevented by law from retaliatory raiding into Comanche territory. They could do little more than lobby a hostile occupation government for aid â€” not always to much effect. Pro-Indian liberals in government as well as East Coast sentimentalists even prevented several murderous Indian chiefs from being hanged. Ironically, the attack those chiefs led was the very incident that caused the Army and federal government finally to act decisively. 
More humane policy 
One of the causes of federal inaction was a genuine desire to handle Indian troubles in a humane way. East of the Mississippi, Indian wars had been bloody affairs that ended with the Indians absolutely destroyed or confined. If anything, Northerners were slightly more violent than Southerners. Yankees tended to wipe out Indians and remove any survivors to small, out of-the-way reservations. In upstate New York, the Continental Army destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages and left survivors to starve or seek aid from the British. In 1794 at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, American troops defeated an Indian force and then removed all remaining Indians from Ohio. After victories in the Midwest, whites paid the surviving Indians paltry sums for their land and sent them West with essentially no support. Abraham Lincolnâ€™s sole experience as a soldier was a brief period of garrison duty with the Illinois Militia in the otherwise bloody Blackhawk War, in which the Sac and Fox Indians were destroyed and forced out of Illinois and Wisconsin. 
In the South, the Cherokee were the source of the longest-running conflict, and held lands in Georgia long after the northeastern states had destroyed their Indians. As tensions with whites mounted, relocation became the favored solution rather than war and ad hoc expulsion, and was carried out mainly though an admittedly one-sided legal process. Cherokee removal was a relatively peaceful and fair solution to two incompatible peoples living close to each other with a long history of violence. Stand Watie, a Cherokee chief who later became a Confederate general, supported the move from Georgia to Oklahoma, and brought his band West well before the now-notorious â€œTrail of Tears.â€ 
In that context it is understandable that after the Civil War, many pressure groups in the East, no longer threatened by Indians, pushed for more peaceful measures. Also backing the changes was the Office of Indian Affairs, which wanted more control over Indians at the expense of the Army. President Grant therefore tried to treat Indians as wards of government rather than independent nations, and to assimilate and civilize them rather than destroy them. 
In the past, Indian wars were often sparked when a dishonest Indian Agent stole government aid to the Indians for his own profit, so in 1869, Grant charged religious groups with carrying out his new policy of turning Indians into peaceful farmers. The denomination that got the Comanche assignment was the Society of Friends, or Quakers. Quakers are one of Americaâ€™s oldest and most influential founding groups. They live a life of piety and thrift, and disavow fancy dress and military action, but it may have been a mistake to pick a group religiously opposed to war in any form. 
President Grantâ€™s agent to the Comanche was Lawrie Tatum of Iowa, who had probably never seen an Indian before he answered his Churchâ€™s call and headed West. Tatum arrived at Fort Sill in 1869 and enacted a sort of Great Society program. He started schools, gave deeds of farmland to the Comanche with instructions for farming, and established a mill for grinding grain. The Comanche also got free coffee, sugar, and blankets, and lived in safety. Soldiers secured Fort Sill and the agentâ€™s supplies, but did not interfere with Comanche activity or take to the field. Quakers would not use the military to keep the Comanche on their reservation and avoid war. 
Tatum worked hard to teach the Comanche to be civilized farmers but was defeated by circumstances. The Comanche cultureâ€™s central focus was on warfare and raiding. Wealth and status could only be acquired through war, and Quaker pacifism was too foreign to graft onto their way of life. Also, welfare handouts are always unsatisfying. The Comanche were not happy with reservation rations and it was far more rewarding to plunder Texans. The Fort Sill Reservation became a sanctuary from which they could wage war. In 1871 there were even scalpings within a short distance of Army posts. Whites had sent a capable and honest agent to deal with the Comanche and bring about peace, but the Comanche were not willing to be peaceful. 
Sherman and the Comanche 
Just as it is today, it was whites who lived furthest from the menace who were convinced they knew best how to handle it. In Philadelphia or New York it was easy to talk about humane Indian policies, but on the frontier, whether in Confederate or Yankee territory, sentiments were different. In Minnesota in 1862, Sioux Indians attacked whites, killing hundreds. Many whites were fresh from northern Europe or descended from the very liberal Puritan and Quaker colonists. Yet they rallied and pushed the Sioux out of the state. 
In Colorado in 1864, Methodist minister and volunteer army officer John Chivington, a fervent abolitionist, led a force of mostly settler militia against a group of Cheyenne after a series of murderous raids. His militia massacred Indians without compunction but his force also included a few regulars from the East who were appalled by the killing and raised a stink. Chivington also made a bad mistake: He attacked a peaceful band of Indians, not the hostile Dog Soldiers, an out-of-control offshoot of the Cheyenne, who were actually doing the raiding. 
Also in 1864 an Army unit under Kit Carson fought the Comanche at the Battle of Adobe Walls, in Hutchinson County, Texas. The Indians surrounded the force but were held off with two mountain howitzers. The cannon were decisive. Carsonâ€™s men were outnumbered nearly ten to one, but killed nearly 100 Indians for a loss of six whites. 
Texans therefore eventually got help from people who knew Indians first hand. Help arrived, ironically, in the form of William T. Sherman, who never had much faith in Grantâ€™s Indian policy. In 1871 he toured Texas to inspect damage from Comanche raids, and had a near encounter with Indians that had an effect on policy. A group of braves led by Set-tainte, Set-tank, and Big Tree attacked a wagon convoy of Army supplies that passed just minutes behind Shermanâ€™s lightly guarded inspection tour. The dozen men on the convoy fought back, but seven were killed, scalped, and mutilated. One man died after being tied upside down to a wagon wheel with a fire set under his head. 
Sherman was shaken by this close call, and sent out the cavalry under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie to investigate. With information from Agent Tatum, Mackenzie cornered the three ringleaders. Set-tank died resisting arrest, but the other two were sent back to Texas for trial. 
Set-tainte and Big Tree were sentenced to death, but not executed. The trial became a circus, with the two Indians at the center of a political struggle they must have found bewildering. As T.R Fehrenbach explains, â€œThere was much popular sentiment in the East against hanging the aborigines; more important, the Indian Bureau and Department of the Interior strongly resented the armyâ€™s interference in Indian affairs.â€ President Grant wired the Reconstruction governor Edmond J. Davis and asked him to commute the sentences to life in prison. Davis did so. Eventually the two were released after serving less than a year. Texans were outraged. Even Quaker Tatum, who by this time was thoroughly disillusioned with the peace policy, was indignant. 
Although President Grant had pushed for a pardon, he reconsidered the peace policy and quietly let Colonel Mackenzie take the field. Mackenzie brought along Gatling guns, which gave his men a real edge over larger forces. (Rapid-fire weapons were rarely used against mass charges of Indians â€” they were too smart to try that â€” but having them meant Mackenzieâ€™s men rarely had to face such charges. Things might have turned out differently for Custer if he had taken Gatling guns.) 
Mackenzie drove ruthlessly into Comanche territory. He was a hard man, who pursued Indians wherever they fled â€” even into Mexico â€” and his men certainly killed women and children. One of his harshest tactics was to capture any Indians he could â€” women, children, elders â€” and hold them hostage. This meant Comanche war parties were forced to move with their entire villages, lest their families wind up in prison camp or dead from a trigger-happy trooper. The Comanche had even more to fear from the militia. Local men who may have known people killed in raids were invariably more vengeful than professional soldiers. 
This policy of interning non-combatant Indians was part of one of the last full-scale campaigns against the Comanche, starting in August 1874, when Mackenzie pursued a force led by Chief Quanah Parker into the Llano Estacado of the Southern Plains. In late September, Mackenzieâ€™s men captured a New Mexican Comanchero trader and made him talk by stretching him over a wagon wheel. He revealed the location of a large Comanche village in a canyon. Mackenzieâ€™s men rode all night and stormed the canyon, capturing the horses, food stores, and teepees. The braves, always excellent fighters, held off the army until the women and children climbed out of the canyon, but Mackenzie burned their supplies and killed their horses. Over the next several days, he pursued and defeated the hungry, foot-bound Comanche. Many braves surrendered and returned to the reservation. 
These tactics greatly reduced the Indian menace by the end of 1875, but the Comanche faced yet another threat. The expanding railroads brought whites armed with new buffalo guns onto the prairie to hunt the buffalo for their skins. The result was a slaughter that nearly wiped out the great herds on which the Comanche had depended for generations. The hunters themselves were dangerous; one group defeated a larger force of Comanche with their excellent rifles in 1874, at the Second Battle of Adobe Walls. Constantly pursued by the Army, starving for want of game, by 1879 the Comanche were a beaten people and never again threatened Texas. From a possible high of 30,000 at the start of the 19th century, the Comanche were reduced to roughly 1,500 by 1878. A once-proud people finally submitted permanently to the reservation. 
The Comanche War is now history, its many tales preserved in movies and books. No Texan now living ever feared a Comanche moon. Today, tribal conflict takes different forms, and it is incursions from the South that are pushing back the white frontier. Clashes are not so sharp as those in the 19th century, but the outcome is no different. The destiny of Texas is being decided through immigration and demographics rather than armed conflict, but the questions remain the same: who will populate and who will rule? Earlier Americans understood what was at stake; todayâ€™s Americans have been numbed into acquiescence."
21131,French Socialists Collapsing Just Weeks Before Election,Breitbart London,"PARIS (AFP)  â€”   Franceâ€™s governing Socialist party was in tatters Thursday after former prime minister Manuel Valls spurned the partyâ€™s official presidential candidate and backed independent centrist Emmanuel Macron. [Vallsâ€™ endorsement of Macron seals the rift between what the former premier has described as â€œtwo irreconcilable leftsâ€  â€”   one still wedded to the class struggle, represented by presidential nominee Benoit Hamon, and another reformist camp led by Valls.  Successive Socialist leaders managed to hold the party together but under President Francois Hollande the tacit   pact between the two factions broke down, leaving the party in disarray. Le Parisien newspaper said Vallsâ€™ repudiation of Hamon  â€”   a leftist rebel who quit the government in 2014 over its   policies  â€”   was the â€œnail in the coffinâ€ of the party. The party of Francois Mitterrand that had acted as a broad church of the left since the 1970s â€œdied yesterday, without panache, corroded by ideological and personal rivalries,â€ the paper wrote. Vallsâ€™ nod comes less than a month before the first round of the election on April 23, with polls showing Macron and   leader Marine Le Pen running   . Hamon is trailing in fifth place, behind conservative candidate Francois Fillon and   radical   Melenchon. The Socialist candidate had always been expected to struggle after five years of lacklustre rule under the unpopular Hollande. Valls said his decision to back Macron, who quit the Socialist government last year to form his own movement, En Marche (On the Move)  â€”   styled as neither of the left nor right  â€”   was â€œnot a matter of the heart but of reasonâ€. â€œI think you should not take any risks for the Republicâ€ Valls said, saying he did the â€œresponsibleâ€ thing in opting for the candidate tipped to easily beat Le Pen in Mayâ€™s election  . But for many on the left the endorsement smacked of treachery after Valls pledged to back the winner of the Socialist primary in January, in which he was the  . A furious Hamon on Wednesday urged voters to reject those who â€œstabbed (me) in the backâ€. A Socialist activist in Marseille lodged a criminal complaint against Valls for â€œbreach of trustâ€ saying his disavowal of Hamon was â€œthe straw that broke the camelâ€™s back. â€ â€œHe (Valls) lostâ€ in the primary,â€ Sylvie   told AFP, calling on Valls to quit the party. â€œIt was up to him to bridge the gapâ€ with Hamon.  â€”   Bedfellows no more  â€”   For Henry Rey, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris, there are not two but three lefts in France: a liberal camp represented by Valls and Macron, a   camp led by Hamon and a radical camp led by Melenchon  â€”   who is now the leading presidential contender on the left. On Wednesday, a bullish Melenchon rebuffed a desperate appeal by Hamon for the two to join forces. â€œItâ€™s clear that trying to make the various lefts cohabit no longer works, as demonstrated by the disastrous end to Hollandeâ€™s presidency,â€ Rey said. â€œThe lines are being redrawn, which is a precondition for the recomposition of the left,â€ he said. The lines are also shifting on the right, with Macron and the nationalist Le Pen draining support from the   Fillon. â€œIt feels as if all the old political forces are dying before our very eyes,â€ political analyst Pascal Perrineau said. Thibaut Rioufreyt, a researcher at Sciences Po university in Lyon, warned however against writing the obituary for the Socialist Party (PS). â€œThe PS has become a federation of local politicians,â€ he wrote in La Croix newspaper. â€œIt will still exist but its positioning will change. â€"

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile admonished the FBI Friday for telling Congress it found new emails related to Hillary Clintonâ€™s private server, and called on the federal agency to state immediately that the Democratic nominee is in the clear. 
â€œFBI Director Comey unequivocally cleared Hillary Clinton of any intentional wrongdoing three months ago, and said that no reasonable prosecutor would pursue the case in question further. Now, 11 days away from the election, he released a vague letter that immediately led to rampant speculation in the news media,â€ Brazile said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner. "
21134,"Is That Real Tuna in Your Sushi? Now, a Way to Track That Fish - The New York Times",Claire Martin,"â€œMost people donâ€™t think data management is sexy,â€ says Jared Auerbach, owner of Redâ€™s Best, a seafood distributor in Boston. Most donâ€™t associate it with fishing, either. But Mr. Auerbach and a few other seafood entrepreneurs are using technology to lift the curtain on the murky details surrounding where and how fish are caught in American waters. Beyond Maine lobster, Maryland crabs and Gulf shrimp, fish has been largely ignored by foodies obsessing over the provenance of their meals, even though seafood travels a complex path. Until recently, diners werenâ€™t asking many questions about where it came from, which meant restaurants and retailers didnâ€™t feel a need to provide the information. Much of whatâ€™s sold has been seen as â€œjust a packaged, nondescript fish fillet with no skin,â€ says Beth Lowell, who works in the   prevention department at Oceana, an international ocean conservation advocacy group. â€œSeafood has been behind the curve on both traceability and transparency. â€ Whatâ€™s worse is that many people have no idea what theyâ€™re eating even when they think they do. In a recent Oceana investigation of seafood fraud, the organization bought fish sold at restaurants, seafood markets, sushi places and grocery stores, and ran DNA tests. It discovered that 33 percent of the fish was mislabeled per federal guidelines. Fish labeled snapper and tuna were the least likely to be what their purveyors claimed they were. Several years ago, Redâ€™s Best developed software to track the fish it procures from small local fishermen along the shores of New England. Sea to Table, a family business founded in the   with headquarters in Brooklyn that supplies chefs and universities, has also developed its own   software to let customers follow the path of their purchases. Woodâ€™s Fisheries, in Port St. Joe, Fla. specializes in sustainably harvested shrimp and uses software called Trace Register. And starting this fall, the public will be able to glimpse the international fishing industryâ€™s practices through a partnership of Oceana, Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to study changes in the landscape. The initiative, called Global Fishing Watch, uses satellite data to analyze fishing boat practices  â€”   including larger trends and information on individual vessels. From a young age, Mr. Auerbach had romantic notions about fishing, specifically the idea of catching fish to feed his family and neighbors. â€œItâ€™s cool in this day and age that people wake up in the morning and go make a living interacting with nature and feeding their community,â€ he said. He went into commercial fishing straight out of college, taking a job on an Alaskan salmon boat and later returning to New England to work on lobster boats and learn more about the fishing industry there. Soon after Mr. Auerbach founded Redâ€™s Best in 2008, he realized that a combination of government regulations and commercial fishingâ€™s embrace of technology were effectively threatening the existence of small fishing boats. Yet smaller boats travel short distances and catch fewer fish, which Mr. Auerbach said improves their quality. â€œWe try to push people to eat local, traceable fish,â€ he said. Like most other seafood distributors, he was relying on an antiquated,   carbon copy system that was so cumbersome, he was routinely shuffling paperwork until 2 a. m. â€œThe boat would get a copy at the point of unloading,â€ Mr. Auerbach said. â€œThe government would get a copy. Iâ€™d file a copy. And then Iâ€™d write in the prices. â€ As for paying the fishermen: â€œIâ€™d have to get checks and then match the checks to the paperwork and mail them. It was an absolute nightmare that wasnâ€™t scalable. â€ Now the Redâ€™s Best software does that work. For instance, a company driver backs a truck down to the long wooden pier in Woods Hole, Mass. each afternoon, so that fishermen can load their bluefish, striped bass, bonito, conch, horseshoe crabs and other seafood. But instead of a thick pad of paper and carbon sheets, the driver wields a waterproof wireless computer tablet with a Bluetooth mobile printer. â€œHeâ€™s putting their catch data directly onto the internet, and our whole staff all over the country can see in real time as fish is being unloaded onto our truck,â€ Mr. Auerbach said. When the fish arrives at Redâ€™s Bestâ€™s Boston plant, it is instantly received into inventory and reported to the federal government. The company affixes a traceability label on each box of fish. The label has a   bar code that can be scanned by smartphones to reveal who caught the fish, where and how. A unique web page is automatically created for that fish. Buyers, typically   wholesalers throughout the country, and their customers can scan the code to learn the story behind the fish. Mr. Auerbach, who has 100 employees, projects the company will sell 20 million pounds of seafood this year, caught almost exclusively by 1, 000 small vessels. Eventually, Redâ€™s Best hopes to sell directly to consumers. â€œLike, a bluefin tuna is being unloaded right this second in Provincetown, Mass. and you buy a pound of it to be delivered to your home tomorrow,â€ he said. â€œI want that tuna sold as deep into the supply chain as possible. â€ By that he means ideally the fish will travel from the companyâ€™s Boston hub directly to home cooksâ€™ refrigerators. Currently, people can buy Redâ€™s Best fish at its store at the Boston Public Market, at several farmersâ€™ markets, or shipped through AmazonFresh and, starting last week, FedEx. â€œI got the data,â€ he said. â€œI got the fish. I know people want it. â€ Sea to Table hopes to sell fish directly to home chefs starting this year, too. But local seafood can cost more than many Americans are accustomed to paying, which partly accounts for the rampant seafood fraud in this country. â€œU. S. fisheries are very well managed and are actually growing nicely,â€ said Michael Dimin, the founder of Sea to Table. â€œBut the U. S. consumerâ€™s been trained to buy cheap food, and imported seafood is really cheap because of I. U. U. fishing. â€ I. U. U. stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated. The result is unsustainably fished, cheap seafood flooding American fish markets and grocery chains. â€œTo us, the secret is traceability,â€ Mr. Dimin said. â€œIf you can shine a light on where it came from, you can make informed decisions. â€ Mr. Auerbach concedes that some local fish is expensive, but he maintains that many   varieties are affordable. â€œMaybe halibut and scallops are for the wealthy,â€ he says. â€œBut dogfish, skate, porgy and mackerel are all very inexpensive, healthy and great tasting. â€"

21136,FDA to withdraw 2 generic ADHD drugs after determining they have no therapeutic effects,Vicki Batts,"FDA to withdraw 2 generic ADHD drugs after determining they have no therapeutic effects 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: Vicki Batts Tags: FDA , ADHD drugs , market withdrawal (NaturalNews) ADHD medications have been subject to public scrutiny for quite some time. Two years ago, the FDA said it had discovered problems with a generic version of a popular ADHD drug known as Concerta. The generic, produced by the pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt, just wasn't up to snuff. And now, the FDA seems to finally be making moves to pull this inferior product off the shelves.Generic drugs are approved by the FDA through their abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) process. In the ANDA process, the federal agency is primarily focused on data that shows the generic drug is a bioequivalent for the reference listed drug, or what many people refer to as the ""brand name"" drug.The term ""bioequivalent"" means that there is no substantial differences in bioavailability between a generic drug and the brand name product. Specifically, it suggests that the extent and rate of absorption of two drug equivalents over the same period of time, at the same dose and under the same conditions, should exhibit similar results. As the FDA explains on their website, ""The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drug.""Unsurprisingly, discrepancies in actual equivalence are often discovered after a generic has been approved.Mallinckrodt's Concerta generic is not the only brand name knock-off under fire. Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of the Lannett Company, also manufactures a generic form of the medication that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has deemed insufficient.As reported by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society: CDER tracked the issues from December 2013 through June 2014, ran a re-analysis of bioequivalence data and ""determined that the Mallinckrodt product may deliver methylphenidate into the body at a slower rate than Concerta during the time period of 7 to 12 hours post-dosing."" Following the CDER's findings, Mallinckrodt filed a lawsuit, which was thrown out by a Maryland federal judge. The pharmaceutical company has since declined to voluntarily withdraw their product from the marketplace. And according to the FDA, the drug manufacturer has yet to submit any new data or information that confirms the bioequivalence of their product to Concerta.Similarly, the CDER concluded in June of 2014 that the data on the Kremers product is insufficient to determine whether or not their generic product is therapeutically equivalent to Concerta. In November that year, the FDA announced that their product was not sufficiently equivalent to the name brand.Both manufacturers may submit a request for a hearing to the FDA within the next month so they can attempt to show why approval for their drugs shouldn't be withdrawn.Of course, the FDA's concerns about the apparent lack of efficacy seen in these generic drugs is rather ironic, given the magnitude of other concerns surrounding these drugs. In 2006, a CBS News report revealed that 25 people died and 54 more suffered serious cardiovascular problems following the use of ADHD medication, in a period of just four years.That may not seem like a lot, but is important to recall that the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which is used to track such events, is a voluntary system. Only drug manufacturers are required to report adverse events â€“ if they know about them. Doctors, patients and family members are under no such obligation. PSQH reports that drug safety experts estimate that only about 10 percent of all adverse events will even be reported â€“ who is to say how many people have been harmed by ADHD medications (and other drugs) and don't know it or haven't reported it?The FAERS website itself states that because of its own limitations, ""FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S. population."" And yet, in spite of this very statement, the FDA itself used this information to form a safety report?Over the years, several ADHD medications, like Adderall XR, have been linked to sudden death , cardiovascular problems and psychosis. According to Consumer Reports , the long-term safety of these drugs has not been evaluated or studied sufficiently, and there is evidence to suggest that the benefit of such drugs wears off after about two years. Many kids take ADHD medication for quite a bit longer than that.In spite of all of this, the FDA has yet to pull these drugs from the shelves, and is instead concerned with drugs that aren't strong enough. Medications that don't work obviously don't belong in the marketplace. However, drugs that are killing children don't belong there either. Sources:"
21137,Report: NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo Hires 2 Florida Fundraisers in Move Toward Presidential Bid - Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,"New York Gov.

21138,Bernie Sanders Facing Pressure Over Supportersâ€™ Actions in Nevada - The New York Times,Yamiche Alcindor,"Raising the prospect of lasting fissures in the party, Senator Bernie Sanders rebuffed pressure on Tuesday to rein in his supporters after they disrupted a weekend Democratic convention in Nevada, throwing chairs and later threatening the state chairwoman in a fight over delegates. The uproar comes as Hillary Clinton is struggling to turn her and the partyâ€™s attention to the fall. Mr. Sandersâ€™s supporters showed no sign of backing down on Tuesday. In interviews, several threatened to disrupt the partyâ€™s convention in Philadelphia in July with protests and nonviolent disobedience over a nominating system that they say has treated Mr. Sanders unfairly. In emails, on social media and on websites, his supporters have traded advice about protest tactics and legal services in case of mass arrests. Alarmed by the unrest in Nevada, Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, said that he spoke with Mr. Sanders on Tuesday and that the Vermont senator faced a â€œtest of leadershipâ€ over his supportersâ€™ actions. Mr. Reid, who represents Nevada, said he was confident that Mr. Sanders would â€œdo the right thing. â€ But Mr. Sanders showed no sign of backing down, releasing a statement that, while condemning violence, accused the Democratic leadership in Nevada of using â€œits power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place. â€ The fight in Nevada underscored the determination of Mr. Sandersâ€™s supporters to undermine Mrs. Clintonâ€™s    march to the nomination. On Tuesday she lost the Oregon primary but declared victory in Kentucky, where she held a   edge according to complete but unofficial returns. Mrs. Clinton spent Monday campaigning in Kentucky, showing how the battle against Mr. Sanders continues to distract her campaign even as she turns her fire on Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. And leading Democrats have become increasingly vocal about the need to unify the party for the general election  â€”   while being careful not to anger Mr. Sanders by urging him to quit the race. Senator Barbara Boxer of California said she had reached out to Mr. Sanders about the need for unity. â€œI have placed a couple of calls to Bernie,â€ Ms. Boxer said. â€œHeâ€™s my friend. Heâ€™s been my friend for many, many, many years, and I havenâ€™t heard back from Bernie, and I would hope that Bernie will be a leader and make sure that everybody understands what is at stake. And what is at stake is the future of our nation. Nothing less. â€ Ms. Boxer, who was in Nevada for the convention on Saturday as Sanders supporters erupted in anger, called what she witnessed â€terrible. â€ â€œWe just canâ€™t have a repeat of that in Philadelphia because itâ€™s distressing,â€ Ms. Boxer said. â€œI have a message to the Bernie people who are planning to be disobedient because the system is rigged. Here is the thing: They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most votes. They should support the Democratic candidate who got the most delegates. There is nothing to protest. â€ But Sanders supporters remained defiant, raising the possibility of unrest on the streets outside the convention. â€œYou are going to see a variety of tactics,â€ said Elizabeth Arnold, 32, a former staff member for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia who said she planned to demonstrate. â€œI personally donâ€™t like being arrested. But itâ€™s essential that we speak our minds and assert our First Amendment rights. Our system is terribly flawed and terribly unjust  â€”   so very just actions often end in arrests. â€ Ms. Arnold, who helped found EDGE, an environmental justice group based in Philadelphia, said she did not condone violence and hoped that people would find a way to voice concerns peacefully. But she said that Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic leaders attending the convention â€œshould worry about what is going to happen. â€ Nina Turner, a prominent surrogate for Mr. Sanders, said that she had seen several emails from people planning acts of civil disobedience, and that talk of dissent in the Republican ranks over Mr. Trump masked the searing divisions among Democrats. â€œPeople are talking about the Republicans having a brokered convention. I think we are sleeping on the Democrats,â€ Ms. Turner said. â€œAnd if Democrats believe that thatâ€™s not going to happen, they are just sadly mistaken. They have blinders on. â€ â€œIt is going to be progressives who will disrupt,â€ she said. â€œAnd when I say disrupt, I donâ€™t mean in a violent or a terrible way, but I just mean upset the apple cart. â€ April Mellody, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Convention, said in a statement that the conventionâ€™s security team would work with the Philadelphia police and the Secret Service â€œto ensure the safety and security of all of our delegates and participants. â€ After the meeting of Nevada Democrats on Saturday ended in mayhem when many potential Sanders delegates were deemed ineligible, Roberta Lange, the state party chairwoman, said she had received death threats against her and her family after Sanders supporters spread her cellphone number online. â€œThe Sanders campaign helped incite everything that happened,â€ she said. â€œInstead of attacking me, they should be publicly apologizing to me for the part that they played. Iâ€™m really disappointed. It makes me feel like it is not being taken seriously. â€ On Tuesday, the Nevada State Democratic Party issued a formal complaint to the Democratic National Committee in response to the behavior of Mr. Sandersâ€™s supporters. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the national party chairwoman, also expressed her concern Tuesday. â€œWe will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas,â€ she said. But the protest effort enjoys some institutional support. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union that has endorsed Mr. Sanders and that has been busing its members across the country to campaign for him, also said her group planned to take part in demonstrations at the convention. â€œWe will be a significant force inside and a significant force outside,â€ she said. â€œThe focus is going to be how disenfranchised the voters felt during this election by the D. N. C. â€"
21139,â€™King Arthurâ€™ First Summer Bomb? $175M Film Tracking for $25M Debut,Daniel Nussbaum,"The summer box office season kicked off with a bang last weekend as Marvelâ€™s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 rocketed to a $146 million opening, but Hollywood could see its first big bomb of the season this weekend as Warner Bros.â€™ expensive tentpole King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is projected to open in the $25 million range. [Arthur, directed by Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes, Snatch) and starring Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law, reportedly cost Warner Bros. and production partner Village Roadshow $175 million to produce, according to the Hollywood Reporter. That number doesnâ€™t count the studioâ€™s marketing spend, which likely puts the final figure closer to $200 million.  But Arthur is reportedly tracking to earn in the $25 million range when it premieres on more than 3, 600 screens on May 12. That wonâ€™t be nearly enough to knock Guardians from the top spot. The James   superhero sequel starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista and Bradley Cooper is projected to remain number one this weekend with a $60 million second frame, which would add to its already hefty global gross of $494 million. King Arthur  â€”   which currently sits at a dismal 22 percent on ratings aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes  â€”   will need to make up ground overseas if it is to turn a profit for Warners and Village Roadshow. Meanwhile, the box office likely wonâ€™t get much help from the weekendâ€™s other   newcomer, the Amy   Hawn   kidnap caper Snatched. Snatched is projected to debut in the   millions range for Fox and Chernin Entertainment. The Jonathan   comedy  â€”   which reportedly cost $42 million to produce  â€”   hopes to benefit from a Motherâ€™s Day weekend release and the return of Hawn after a   absence from the big screen, but early reviews of the film have been highly negative, with critics singling out Hawnâ€™s underwhelming performance and the filmâ€™s subtly racist undertones. Also opening this weekend is   Attractionsâ€™ Iraq War psychological thriller The Wall, directed by Doug Liman and starring Aaron   and John Cena,   comedy Absolutely Anything with Simon Pegg and the Monty Python crew, and the indie drama Lowriders starring Melissa Beniost and Eva Longoria.

21141,Physicians on Ryanâ€™s Obamacare 2.0: â€˜Doomed for Failureâ€™ - Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,"Physicians urging     health care say House Speaker Paul Ryanâ€™s newly released proposal to repeal Obamacare does not actually repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and, therefore, is â€œdoomed for failure. â€[â€œSince this does not completely repeal the ACA, we are still left with thousands of pages of regulations that will have unknown consequences in the future,â€ Dr. Gerard Gianoli, of the   Ear and Balance Institute, tells Breitbart News. â€œThe GOP plan is worse than a repeal with no replacement plan at all. â€  Gianoli explains: It will not prevent the death spiral of the insurance industry, which will be now blamed on Republicans, and the march toward a     system will continue. The GOP plan is doomed for failure. Instead of returning the insurance market to the vigor of a free market, the government will be supporting it with tax credits  â€”   the flip side of the ACA insurance penalty. Gianoli says the difference between Obamaâ€™s health insurance plan and Ryanâ€™s proposal amounts to semantics: The difference is considering whether the bottle is half full or half empty. In other words, there really isnâ€™t any difference. Further, the stipulation of preventing the insurance industry from   premiums from initial policy inception will lead to continued gaming of the system that will not be adequately adjusted by the â€œ30% penaltyâ€ for interrupted coverage. Hopefully, this plan will not be passed. Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, also observes to Breitbart News that the new proposal  â€”   kept secret by Ryan until its release  â€”   â€œis 57 pages with a number of â€˜repeal thisâ€™ and â€˜repeal thatâ€™ clauses, but no â€˜repeal ACA. â€™â€ â€œSo to paraphrase Nancy Pelosi, what is still in it?â€ Orient asks. â€œWas that the subject of secret meetings with special interests?â€ Orient continues: â€œRefundableâ€ tax credits  â€”   for those who donâ€™t owe taxes  â€”   are still a subsidy. It is still redistribution of wealth, with winners (those who get the subsidy) and losers (those who pay for it). And the chief winner is the â€œhealth plan. â€ It gets money the supposed beneficiary may get nothing, or only rationed care from a narrow network. â€œThe problem is comprehensive   payment,â€ Orient adds. â€œThe bill perpetuates this disastrous concept. A true   bill  â€”   â€œthere shall be a free market in health insuranceâ€  â€”   would remove all federal mandates, subsidies, barriers to competition, or protections or advantages for cartels. â€ Conservatives such as former House Freedom Caucus chairman Jim Jordan and Virginia Rep. Dave Brat also object to Ryanâ€™s proposed Obamacare repeal plan, asserting it is still Obamacare in a different form. â€œThe bill maintains many of the federal features including a new entitlement program as well as most of the insurance regulations,â€ Brat said. â€œNow [they] are saying weâ€™re going to do repeal and replace but the bill does nothing of the sort. [Speaker] Paul Ryan has always said the entire rationale for this bill is to bend the cost curve down, and so far I have seen no evidence that this bill will bring the cost curve down. â€"
21142,Hillary and the Ghosts of Watergate,Charles Hugh Smith,"| Charles Hugh Smith | Of Two Minds | 286 views 
If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds. 
The parallels between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon are not legalâ€“they are political: specifically, how can a leader crippled by scandal and cover-ups govern? 
In even blunter terms: how can a crippled politico deliver the goods to the special interests who bet their cash and political capital on the politicoâ€™s ability to deliver favors? 
Among the many ghosts of Watergate, one specter especially haunts Hillary: once the special interests and party stalwarts who defended you through every scandal and every cover-upâ€“month after month and year after year, on the promise that you would deliver the goods upon ascending to the presidencyâ€“realize you are too damaged to deliver anything of value to anyone, why would they continue supporting you? 
Once a politico has to declare â€œI am not a crookâ€ based on legalese rather than a moral foundation, that politicoâ€™s ability to lead has vanished. Hillary and her supporters rely entirely on legalese parsing of wrong-doing rather than on a self-explanatory, basic moral foundation of right and wrong. 
Declaring â€œI am not a crookâ€ because the wrongdoing escapes prosecution is the same as declaring â€œI am above the law.â€ If the foundation of oneâ€™s ability to lead is a reliance on legal parsing and allies in the Department of Justice squashing investigations while handing out immunity like candy on Halloween, the political capital required to lead no longer exists. 
Ultimately, the President leads by moral suasion. Even the political act of delivering the goods to the special interests that funded your campaign and your wealth must be backed by the moral authority of personal integrity and a morally grounded appeal to the common good. 
A politician who has effectively zero personal integrity is only as viable as his/her ability to deliver favors to the few (i.e. special interests) over the objections of the many. A reliance on cold-blooded horse-trading only works if the leader has enough political capital to arm-twist everyone into granting favors to allies and special interests. 
But this political capital rests on moral suasion and support earned not by issuing promises but by leading the nation through thorny thickets to solutions that work for the many, not just the few. 
Once the ability to lead has been lost, special interests can forget about getting favors. And once they realize their politico is a liability rather than an asset, self-preservation requires abandoning the liability as quickly as possible. 
Itâ€™s nothing personal, itâ€™s just business. Anyone who thinks Hillary has the personal integrity to build sufficient political capital to lead is delusional. Anyone who believes Hillary has the moral foundation to deliver the goods to the myriad special interests that have funded her campaign and her personal wealth is equally delusional. 
Are Goldman Sachs et al. delusional? If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds."
21143,"Howard Hodgkin, Whose Paintings Were Coded With Emotion, Dies at 84 - The New York Times",William Grimes,"Howard Hodgkin, a British artist whose lush, semiabstract paintings, aquiver with implicit drama, established him as one of the most admired artists of the postwar period, died on Thursday in London. He was 84. The Tate Galleries announced his death but did not specify a cause. Mr. Hodgkin was a relative latecomer to fame. A slow, methodical worker who could spend years building up a paintingâ€™s surface, he did not have a solo show until he was 30, and for years thereafter toiled against the grain, his work at odds with prevailing fashion. His globs and stipples and smears  â€”   seemingly brisk and impulsive, but painstakingly applied and endlessly revised  â€”   ravished. On the Tateâ€™s website, Nicholas Serota, the departing director of the museums, called Mr. Hodgkin â€œone of the great artists and colorists of his generation. â€ But his coded emotional settings seemed elusive, even baffling, as did his stylistic relationship to current art. In Britain he was seen as an abstract painter, in the United States as representational  â€”   a puzzle. â€œI never expected anyone to be interested in my pictures, and there were years when I couldnâ€™t even get my friends to look at them,â€ Mr. Hodgkin told The New York Times in 1990. His paintings in the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1984 propelled him into the top echelon of international artists. Seductive and arresting, they showed an artist at the height of his powers, and audiences responded. â€œNot since Robert Rauschenbergâ€™s appearance at the Biennale 20 ago has a show by a single painter so hogged the attention of visitors, or looked so effortlessly superior to everything else on view by living artists,â€ the critic Robert Hughes wrote in Time magazine. He added: â€œHere the wearisome traits of much contemporary art, its honking rhetoric, its unconvincing urgency, its arid â€˜appropriationsâ€™ of motifs, are left at the door, and the   complexities of mature, articulate painting greet the eye. â€ Mr. Hodgkin won the Turner Prize a year later, and as major gallery and museum exhibitions in Britain and the United States followed, one after the other, his distinctive blend of bravura brushwork, emotional depth and sense of mystery began to hold sway. He came to be seen as a highly original interpreter of the dramas that unfold in intimate, interior space, an heir to Bonnard and Vuillard. â€œOn the subject of sitting rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms and balconies neither Hodgkinâ€™s eye nor his hand has ever failed him,â€ the critic John Russell wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1990. â€œHe is   on the subject of hotels, restaurants, private collections, public parks, costume jewelry, human exchanges of all kinds and    weather reporting. Manners and mores, ups and downs, ins and outs  â€”   all have their place in his paintings. â€œHe can make a wet afternoon in summer feel like the most blissful thing that ever happened,â€ he continued, â€œand when he summons up the quintessence of a restaurant (in London, by the way, not in Paris) he makes us want to stand up and shout for the menu. â€ Gordon Howard Eliot Hodgkin was born in London on Aug. 6, 1932, to a Quaker family with an illustrious pedigree in the arts and sciences. His father, Eliot, was a manager at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and a   horticulturalist. His mother, the former Katharine Hewart, daughter of the Lord Chief Justice of England, Gordon Hewart, was a homemaker and botanical illustrator. With German air raids looming, Howard was evacuated in 1940 with his mother and sister to Long Island, where he stayed with family friends for three years. After returning to Britain, he attended a variety of expensive schools, including Eton, and ran away from most of them, finding little encouragement for his determination to become an artist  â€”   his goal since the age of 5. He painted on his own, and during a return visit to Long Island in 1947, he began going to galleries and museums in New York City, looking closely at the work of Matisse, Degas, Bonnard and Vuillard. One of his earliest works, the 1949 gouache â€œMemoirs,â€ served as a marker for the themes that would preoccupy him in the coming years. Judith Higgins wrote in Art News in 1985, â€œHighly stylized, fiercely outlined and angular, humming with erotic currents, â€˜Memoirsâ€™ announced the subject of all Hodgkinâ€™s subsequent work: the great tradition in French painting  â€”   figures in an interior  â€”   transmuted, in Hodgkinâ€™s case, by memory. â€ In 1949 he gained admission to the Camberwell School of Art in London, where he studied briefly under Victor Pasmore and William Coldstream, the leading figures in the Euston Road School. He spent four years at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, where he studied with Clifford Ellis. In 1955 he married Julia Lane, a fellow student at Corsham. They later separated. He is survived by their two sons, Louis and Sam. Mr. Hodgkin was given a   show at Arthur Tooth and Sons in 1962, but for years he depended on teaching to make a living. In the   he began lecturing at Charterhouse School. He later taught at the Bath Academy of Art and the Chelsea School of Art. He produced mostly   works until late in his career, on canvas at first but, beginning in the late 1960s, only on wood, usually old boards scavenged from London antique shops. In violation of the tenets of American abstraction, he embraced the frame, emphasizing its presence by painting on it directly, or including framing rectangles in the painting. The strongly geometric forms of the early painting evolved into looser, brushier images that teased the idea of figuration. In â€œJealousyâ€ (1977) a red mass, barely human, coils angrily within a   rectangle. The leaning, spotted rectangles in â€œDinner at Smith Squareâ€ ( ) suggest, just barely, two people conversing over a table. â€œI am a representational painter but not a painter of appearances,â€ Mr. Hodgkin told the critic David Sylvester in 1976. â€œI paint representational pictures of emotional situations. â€ His reputation grew. He had his first show in New York in 1973, and in 1976 Mr. Serota organized his first museum exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford. In 1995 the Metropolitan Museum of Art organized the traveling exhibition â€œHoward Hodgkin: Paintings 1975 â€”  1995,â€ and in 2006 Tate Britain mounted a   survey of his work. If Mr. Hodgkin never quite rose to the celebrity rank of Lucian Freud or David Hockney, by the time he was knighted, in 1992, he stood at the threshold of â€œliving treasureâ€ status. â€œTo be an honest artist now, you have to make your own language, and for me that has taken a very long time,â€ he told Mr. Sylvester for the catalog to â€œHoward Hodgkin: Forty Paintings, â€ a traveling exhibition that incorporated many of the paintings from the Biennale. Mr. Hodgkin was an interviewerâ€™s nightmare, notoriously reticent about his work and unhappy analyzing its meaning. He made it clear that art was a slow and painful business. At the same time, he confessed to feeling a sense of exhilaration in his final years. â€œI donâ€™t care a damn about what happens when Iâ€™m dead, but I do have a sense of increased urgency,â€ he told The Guardian in 2001. â€œAnd I think itâ€™s made me more courageous. â€"

21145,"Donald Trump, Samsung, Chicago Cubs: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Karen Workman and Sandra Stevenson,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Hereâ€™s the  .) Good evening. Hereâ€™s the latest. 1. Some Republicans who deserted Donald Trump over his lewd comments about women in a recording that surfaced last week are now doubling back, and his campaign is keeping up the pressure on them to do so. Heâ€™s claimed that his crude words have never turned into actions, but we spoke with two women who said Mr. Trump touched them inappropriately. He denied the allegations. Mr. Trump may have fallen behind by double digits in some national surveys, but until today, he had held the lead in one poll. Now itâ€™s clear why: one    black man in Illinois who was supporting him. The unusual weight given to the manâ€™s response allowed him to distort national polling averages. ____ 2. Itâ€™s been eight years since Suleiman Abdullah Salim, above, was released from one of the C. I. A. â€™s secret prisons in Afghanistan, where he was held for five years without charges. But the beatings and other harsh tactics he was subjected to in what he calls â€œThe Darknessâ€ continue to haunt him. Exactly why he was detained remains murky, but he was eventually found not to be a terrorist threat. Now heâ€™s a plaintiff in a lawsuit against two C. I. A. contractors. â€œI want the people who did this to be judged,â€ he said. ____ 3. Wells Fargoâ€™s embattled chief executive, John Stumpf, above, has abruptly decided to step down. The announcement comes just over a month after the bank was handed a $185 million fine for a   scandal in which employees opened fake accounts in clientsâ€™ names. Complaints about the fraudulent accounts date back 2005. Mr. Stumpf will be immediately replaced by Timothy Sloan, the bankâ€™s president and chief operating officer. ____ 4. Samsung has not said what caused its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones to catch fire, but it is expecting a $2. 3 billion loss from its decision to kill the model. The full price the company will pay for the faulty phones may be harder to quantify, however. Its response to the crisis has drawn criticism for being overly â€œbureaucratic,â€ and the publicâ€™s frustration was starting to show. One research company estimated that Samsung could lose more than $10 billion because of the phoneâ€™s troubles. ____ 5. The Islamic State is using weaponized drones  â€”   including some models that you can buy on Amazon (without the weapons) which they attach explosives to. Two Kurdish fighters were killed in northern Iraq this month when a drone that they shot down blew up. The terror group had been known to use drones for surveillance, but that was believed to be the first time it successfully used one as a weapon to kill troops. American advisers fear the group will expand its use of drones in the fight for Mosul, and they say the Pentagon needs to do more to counter the threat. ____ 6. In Russia, the military appears to be increasing its arsenal of inflatable tanks, jets and missile launchers. The company that makes them also makes bouncy castles. Their use is part of a military strategy, called maskirovka, to mislead its enemies. The hope is that the decoys will draw attacks that might have otherwise hit real weapons systems. The inflatable tank costs about $16, 000. If youâ€™d also like fake tank tracks stamped in the ground, that device is sold separately. ____ 7. The parent of Snapchat has made its first big step toward making what may be the most eagerly awaited new internet stock offering since Twitter. It picked banks  â€”   Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs  â€”   to handle the offering, according to people briefed on the matter. Snap Inc. as the company recently renamed itself, was most recently valued by private investors at about $19 billion. ____ 8. One of our   stories is written by a woman who became addicted to Adderall as a college student and wasnâ€™t able to stop using it until she was 30. The drug is prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but is often taking by students without a prescription who believe it will help them study. Very little is known about the drugâ€™s   effects. â€œIn a sense, then, we are the walking experiment,â€ she writes. â€œSometimes I think of us as Generation Adderall. â€ ____ 9. Wonder Woman is about to embark on a new role, but itâ€™s not in the pages of a comic book. Sheâ€™s being made the United Nationsâ€™ new honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls. The new title will become official at an event in New York on Oct. 21, which is also the characterâ€™s 75th anniversary. ____ 10. Could the Chicago Cubs, contenders for the National League Championship, go all the way? The team last won the World Series when the last century was dawning, above, and tales of jinxes related to a dead goat that purported to explain those dark decades are floating around again. Jon Lester, the Cubsâ€™ veteran ace, isnâ€™t having any of it. â€œNobody really cares in there about a curse or a goat or anything else, you know what I mean?â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s almost better to play naÃ¯ve and just go out and worry about us and not anything else or, like I said, any animals. â€ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And donâ€™t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a. m. Sundays. Want to look back? Hereâ€™s last nightâ€™s briefing.

21150,Zen and the Art of Managing Smartphone Photos - The New York Times,Brian X. Chen,"If your digital photos are a mirror of your life, they may also serve as a reminder that there is only so much you can control and that at some point you just need to let things go. That was the lesson I learned after trying to create a    guide to organizing and storing smartphone photos, based on interviews with professional photographers and a week of testing multiple   services and gadgets. I spent days experimenting with neurotic tagging systems, tedious backup processes and album management, and finally turned to Brian Christian, a computer scientist and philosopher, for advice. The healthiest approach to managing photos, it turns out, is a Zen one: to not deal with them much at all. Mr. Christian said photo organization illustrates a   principle known as the    . If you spend tons of time rummaging for a specific photo, then sorting photos may be worthwhile. But if you hunt for a picture infrequently, sorting may be a waste of time. â€œIf it would take you eight hours to tag all your friends, you should not undertake that until youâ€™ve already wasted eight hours digging up photos of your friends,â€ said Mr. Christian,   of â€œAlgorithms to Live By,â€ a book about using algorithmic principles to improve your life. In other words, people need a   method that saves time  â€”   and that allows them to essentially throw out the need to sort and tag their enormous photo sprawl. So I tried several   services and devices to determine what that method might be. Over a week, I tested three backup services with my iPhone photo library of about 8, 000 images: Appleâ€™s iCloud photo library, Dropbox and Google Photos, which automatically take your photos and store them in the cloud. I also tested two data backup devices from SanDisk and Synology. My conclusion: For smartphone shooters, the secret to photo nirvana is to take a deep breath and let Google back up and organize everything. Appleâ€™s iCloud was straightforward. In the iPhoneâ€™s camera settings, flipping on iCloud Photo Library uploads all your photos to iCloud, which is accessible by Apple and Windows devices. Dropboxâ€™s   service uploads photos to your Dropbox folder, which is compatible with various devices like Windows PCs, iPhones and Android phones. For Google Photos, as soon as you set up the app, it starts backing everything up in Googleâ€™s cloud service called Drive, also accessible on various devices. All three services took several days to back up my entire library over a   connection while I was asleep. Google Photos quickly set itself apart with its smarter   features. It scans your photos and organizes them in several ways. For one, it can detect the face of a person and group all the photos of that person into an album, which you can name. With photos taken within a short time span, like your trip to a beach over the weekend, Google Photos might create a video montage or an album with a label like â€œA weekend in San Francisco. â€ The service also managed to identify pictures of items, like receipts and food, and group them into their own albums with labels. Dropbox and Appleâ€™s photo services had   features, but not the smarts of Googleâ€™s service. Appleâ€™s app groups photos into collections based on when and where photos were taken it can also organize photos by faces, similar to Google. Dropbox uploads photos into a folder labeled Camera Uploads and labels each file by the date and time it was taken. Another benefit of Google Photos is its free offering is the most generous  â€”   enough to let you try out the service thoroughly before deciding whether to pay. The service offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images at no cost. For   images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs. In contrast, Apple offers five gigabytes free and thereafter charges at least $1 a month for 50 gigs Dropbox offers two gigabytes of free storage before charging at least $10 a month for a terabyte. Anil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos, said the company built Google Photos to make it easy to keep, manage and share photos and videos. Apple and Dropbox did not immediately have comment. I also tested two physical devices for managing photos: the SanDisk iXpand, a small drive that plugs directly into the power port of an iPhone and automatically backs up photos, and Synologyâ€™s DS216+II, a new disk storage system that connects to your internet at home to create a personal cloud. The iXpand device was deeply flawed  â€”   it tried to back up all my photos for six hours before the iPhone ran out of battery and the backup failed entirely. Synologyâ€™s   software backed up my photos quickly and had some features like face and location tagging, but organizing photo albums still required lots of manual labor. SanDisk said the issue I experienced was a known problem affecting a small number of devices and that an app update would be released next week to fix the bug. A Synology spokeswoman said that with its   storage systems, customers could back up a broad array of media on a private cloud. In the end, Google Photos solves multiple problems: It handles organization, making the     minimal. It creates a backup of photos, so you can free up space on your smartphone while safeguarding pictures in case the device is lost or stolen. Once all your photos are on Google Photos, they need not live on the phone. Unfortunately, there is no quick way to delete thousands of photos. I plugged my iPhone into a Mac, imported my older photos and checked the box that says â€œDelete items after import. â€ Then I deleted them all from the computer. (In the future, it will be easier to delete smaller batches straight off the phone.) What about blurry, unwanted images? The most important lesson of Google Photos is to stop thinking of the digital photo album like a physical scrapbook. With a traditional photo album, you would spend time flipping through pages before landing on the right photo. With Google Photos, you can treat it like a giant searchable junk drawer: You can simply open the Google Photos app or Google Drive, type in a keyword for what you want to see, pull up that photo and ignore everything else. You can make some changes here and there  â€”   like renaming or adding photos to albums  â€”   but otherwise, why bother? One caveat: The Zen approach does not apply to those with professional cameras. For professional photographers, some organization is a plus and Google Photos and cloud services are not ideal because large photos would take too long to upload. Ben Long, a professional photographer in San Francisco, said he diligently tagged his photos with keywords using Adobeâ€™s Lightroom app to make them easy to find later. â€œI put tagging up there with flossing and stretching: things you know youâ€™re supposed to do and theyâ€™re really a drag to do, but you just get in the habit of it,â€ he said. For the rest of us, thereâ€™s another reason to not bother deleting photos in Google Photos: Google adds creative touches to images that you thought were previously unwanted. If you took multiple shots of a sun setting or your child smiling, for example, it stitches them into an animation. â€œThe lower the cost is of searching, then the more one should ask the question of, should I be organizing this at all?â€ Mr. Christian said. After migrating my entire photo library to Google Photos, my answer is a resounding no."
21151,One Wine Glass to Rule Them All - The New York Times,Eric Asimov,"At some point along every wine drinkerâ€™s arc of discovery, the time comes to invest in a set of glasses. Choosing the right one may seem complicated, confusing and occasionally overwhelming. The process can be fraught with anxiety, as many different glass styles are available, and points of view clash on what is proper and necessary. Corkscrew aside, a stemmed glass is the only indispensable piece of equipment needed to enjoy the best a bottle has to offer, and the least expensive, easiest way to invest in better drinking is to buy a good set. Not that wine canâ€™t be consumed without them. Tumblers can serve as informal wine glasses, and are perfectly appropriate for simple bottles in easygoing establishments. You could drink from a porrÃ³n, a traditional Spanish glass pitcher that was a modern adaptation of the leather wineskin, or bota bag, once carried by Spanish shepherds. You may even drink straight from the bottle, though I recommend reserving this method for   celebrations. While fitting for certain occasions, these primitive vessels do not enhance the   experience. Good stemmed glasses, on the other hand, are expressly designed to make an inherently delightful activity even better. Selecting a set is simple once you cut through the noise. Recently, I joined my colleagues at The Sweethome, a product review site owned by The New York Times Company, to test more than 50 different wine glasses. Among our recommendations was a   glass, the Libbey Kentfield Estate Signature   at $22. 99 for a set of four a more elegant set, the Riedel Vinum   glass, $55 to $90 for a set of four and a   glass, the Zalto Denkâ€™Art Universal glass, at $59 a glass. Depending on your budget, any of these glasses would be excellent for all types of wine. For some time now, glass producers have promoted the   idea that every sort of wine requires a distinctive glass to intensify the aromas and flavors of the particular variety. This is nonsense. Most households need only one set of   glasses, which is perfectly fine for whites, reds, sparkling wines, rosÃ©s and fortified wines. A good,   stemmed glass ought to be vertically shaped, with a tall bowl that opens wide at the stem and then tapers gently inward toward the lip. This taper channels aromas upward to the nose, amplifying them as you swirl and sniff. Over time, many wine lovers develop the habit of swirling the glass, believing that the action increases the wineâ€™s exposure to air and activates the aromas. I believe it. I am an inveterate swirler, to the point where I unconsciously do it even with my water glass. In order to avoid sloshing the wine onto yourself or, worse, someone else, good glasses should be tall and capacious enough to contain a decent amount of wine when filled a third of the way up. They should not be so big that a third of a glass holds an absurd amount. The rule of thirds allows for swirling without fear of consequences. This desirable vertical shape is often called a Bordeaux glass, which is generally contrasted with a Burgundy glass, which has a shorter, wider, more rounded bowl. These are traditional terms but in no way binding. You can certainly drink Bordeaux from a Burgundy glass, and vice versa. Burgundy glasses are not bad, but I find the Bordeaux shape to be more versatile. It works well with any sort of wine. Good wine glasses must be clear, so that nothing interferes with a transparent display of the wineâ€™s color. The glass should not be hued, beveled or decorated in any way that may interfere with its clarity. Nor should it flare outward like a martini glass. Many regions have used glasses that over generations became part of the areaâ€™s cultural tradition. The copita, for example, is a narrow, stubby glass that is used in the Andalusia region of Spain and elsewhere for sherry. Regardless of the tradition, it is a terrible glass for sherry. The   glass is a far better choice. Similarly, German riesling is often served in small, narrow glasses with a slight flare outward. These, too, are not in the best interest of the wine. The   glass is the better option. Even Champagne and sparkling wines, which have so often been consigned to    vessels like the flute or the coupe, are better served by the   glass. However, the aromas and flavors of the wine are not always the primary concern. Champagne served in a flute connotes elegance and festive celebration. At certain times, the occasion trumps everything else. No one should feel bad about using flutes for sparkling wines. My point is that special glasses like flutes are not a requirement. If the aim is to enhance the quality of the wine, the   glass is better. At times, you may see general references to white wine glasses and red wine glasses. Invariably, the red wine glass is larger than the white wine glass. This, too, is pointless tradition, derived from the days when, as the old saw has it, â€œthe first duty of wine is to be red. â€ Nowadays, nothing about white wine is subordinate to red, so there is no need for smaller glasses unless, for some reason, itâ€™s a preference. While having one set of   glasses is sufficient, it may be the beginning, depending on your budget and your inclinations. If you can afford it, owning an exquisite set of glasses like the Zalto Universals can be a joy, even if you only use them for special occasions. Just as great tools can improve any experience, whether woodworking or playing guitar, so can great craftsmanship enhance the sensual pleasure of holding a glass in your hand, to say nothing of drinking the wine. The better the quality, the thinner the glass. The best glasses can seem sheer and ethereal in the hand. Lesser glasses may have a discernible ridge where the bowl joins the stem, and a thick lip at the rim. Better examples are smooth and continuous. You may have other reasons for owning more than one set of glasses. If you like to have dinner parties where several wines are served, you may want enough glasses so that two different wines can be contrasted and enjoyed at the same time. If both wines are the same color, you will need sets that are distinct enough to avoid pouring the wrong wine into the wrong glass. A few words about stemless glasses: I donâ€™t like them. Sure, tumblers are fine for unremarkable wines in casual situations. But for good wines, stemmed glasses are ideal. They can be held by the stem so that the temperature of the wine wonâ€™t be altered by the warmth of the hands, and so fingerprints wonâ€™t smudge the glass. Stemless glasses intended for good wines seem to me the epitome of reverse snobbery. They were included in the Sweethome tests, and I found them unwieldy and unpleasant to use, even as I was asked to express preferences among them. I donâ€™t recommend them. That said, if you are drawn to stemless glasses, follow your desires. The most important thing of all is to please yourself. In the end, let your taste be your guide."
21152,Leonard Cohen dies after hearing the Trumphole won,nan,"Friday, 11 November 2016 RIP to truly great man - Leonard spent his life singing about the real issues of being human 
When one of Leonards friends told him about the Trumphole victory he had a heart attack and dropped dead on the spot. 
It was well known he was ill and had to go back on the road after his manager ripped him off, but it seems the rise of Neo-Nazism in the US was the final straw for his saddened heart. He had not long completed his final album written about the US election called 'You want it darker' which now will become historically famous as a work of astonishing prescience. 
He is best remembered for his magnificent song Hallelujah and his 60's 'tell it like it is sister' lyrics which inspired people to understand the voices in their own heart and not to project hatred upon others. 
Who could ever forget KD Lang singing that song at the Montreal Olympics, it was the highlight of the games. 
RIP to a great man, may his message that is needed ever more now resonate in the hearts of all, especially those that see pubescent hatred as a valid way of relating to the world. Make Jung in the Jungle's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)"

Donald Trump delivers POWERFUL policy speech on First 100 Days In Office By Debbie Menon on October 24, 2016 GROUNDBREAKING CONTRACT FOR THE AMERICAN VOTER 
Trump Presents 100-Day Plan To Make America Great Again â€“ For Everyone 
Gettysburg, PA: Today, in historic Gettysburg, PA, Donald J. Trump presented a game-changing plan for his first 100 days in office. This revolutionary â€œContract with the American Voterâ€ will ensure that Americaâ€™s economy is revitalized and citizens are protected. 
â€œIâ€™m not a politician, and have never wanted to be one. But when I saw the trouble our country was in, I knew I couldnâ€™t stand by and watch any longer. Our country has been so good to me, I love our country, I felt I had to act,â€ said Mr. Trump in his address. 
â€œChange has to come from outside this broken system. The fact that the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime,â€ he continued. 
â€œI am asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics, and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character. I am asking you to dream big. 
â€œWhat follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter â€“ and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington,â€ he concluded. 
DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER 
â€œTherefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: 
FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. 
On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers: 
FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollarsâ€™ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix Americaâ€™s water and environmental infrastructure 
Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: 
FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that wonâ€™t take them back FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. 
Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: 
1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. 
2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. 
3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. 
4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. 
5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. 
6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. 
7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. 
8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. 
9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values 
10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. 
On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. 
This is my pledge to you. 
And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.â€ Related Posts:"
21154,Brooklyn Man Charged With Killing Imam and Assistant Near Mosque - The New York Times,"Rick Rojas, Liz Robbins, Noah Remnick and William K. Rashbaum","Two days after an imam and his assistant were gunned down after afternoon prayers in Queens, the police said late Monday that a man they had in custody had been charged in the killings. The man, Oscar Morel of Brooklyn, 35, who was taken into custody late Sunday after the police connected him to a hit and run that occurred about a mile away from the fatal attack, faces two counts of   murder and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, the police said. A police official said investigators had found what they believe was the murder weapon in the manâ€™s home as well as clothes matching the description of what the gunman had been wearing during the shootings. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the gun was found inside a wall in his apartment, on Miller Avenue in the East New York neighborhood, in a cavity that had apparently been cut open and resealed. A man who answered a phone listed for Mr. Morelâ€™s family said that he was stunned by the arrest. â€œThat is our relative,â€ the man said, his voice soft and shaking with emotion. â€œWe are just finding out ourselves. Weâ€™re pulling together the pieces as well. â€ In Bangladesh, the oldest of the imamâ€™s seven children, Fayez Uddin Akonjee, 28, said he was relieved at the charges and expressed gratitude to the police. But in an interview in his native language, Bengali, he was still seething with anger. â€œWe want to know as victims why he killed my father,â€ he said. â€œWhat was his motive behind killing my father? Whether he was hired or appointed by someone else to kill my father or did he himself plan and kill my father?â€ Earlier Monday evening, New York City officials sought to reassure members of the Muslim community in New York, saying that a â€œstrong person of interestâ€ was in police custody. At a news conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged the fear that had spread among members of the cityâ€™s Bangladeshi community over concerns that the two men, who were dressed in religious garb at the time of the attack, had been targeted because of their faith. â€œItâ€™s a very rare thing to see a cleric killed, and the Muslim community has already been on edge,â€ Mr. de Blasio said. â€œI assured the members of the community the N. Y. P. D. would be out in force. â€ The killings of the imam, Alauddin Akonjee, 55, and his assistant, Thara Miah, 64, have shaken those in the Bangladeshi community, many of whom reside in the area around Ozone Park where the men lived, worshiped and were killed. In that neighborhood, some have been calling the attack a hate crime, even though police officials said the motivation for the killings remained unclear. Investigators believe the gunman followed the two men to the corner of Liberty Avenue and 79th Street and shot each in the back of the head, police officials said. In surveillance footage captured by cameras nearby, investigators were able to see the assailant get into his car, a black GMC sport utility vehicle, and drive away, soon blending into traffic, Robert K. Boyce, the Police Departmentâ€™s chief of detectives, told reporters on Monday. By tracking the make and model of the vehicle, he said, investigators found that the same kind of vehicle had been involved in a hit and run nearby, at the intersection of Pine Street and Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn. Investigators found the car parked on the street in East New York, where they waited for the driver to emerge. On Sunday night, officials said the man got into the car and rammed into a police vehicle as he tried to flee. The man was arrested in connection with the hit and run and hitting the police vehicle. Chief Boyce said investigators were searching his home on Monday night. â€œBecause of the evidence so far, we strongly believe this is the individual,â€ Chief Boyce said. Still, Chief Boyce said investigators had not determined the motivation for the attack, and that it was unclear if the man had any connection to the two murder victims. â€œWeâ€™re still drilling down on it,â€ Chief Boyce said of the motive, adding that it was â€œcertainly on the table that itâ€™s a hate crime. â€œRight now,â€ he said, â€œwe canâ€™t explain why that person was there. â€ Earlier in the day, the funeral prayers for Mr. Akonjee and Mr. Miah drew several hundred mourners along with Mr. de Blasio and other officials in a nondescript parking lot in East New York, bordering Ozone Park. The same people who had worshiped five times a day at Mr. Akonjeeâ€™s   Jame Masjid, a modest   house turned into a mosque, came to get a last look at their imamâ€™s closed coffin, draped in fabric of gold and green and resting in the back of a hearse. The imam came to the United States in 2011 and moved his family to New York a year later to provide a better education for his children. Now his wife and two of his children will fly back with his body to Bangladesh. .  At the funeral prayers, Mr. de Blasio said: â€œIn Islam, the loss of a person is regarded not just as a loss for their family, but for the entire community. Thatâ€™s something we as New Yorkers understand, again across all faiths, across all neighborhoods, when a loss is felt so deeply, when it affects us all. â€ Several speakers implored the police to increase security efforts in the neighborhood, placing security cameras and patrols outside the mosques. People held signs declaring, â€œWe Are Muslims, Not Terrorists,â€ â€œWe Want Peace,â€ â€œWe Want Justiceâ€ and â€œMuslim Lives Matter. â€ â€œYou will see in the Muslim communities in our city, the N. Y. P. D. will be there in support of this community,â€ Mr. de Blasio said. â€œYou will see today and in the days thereafter extra N. Y. P. D. presence protecting our mosques and protecting the people of our Muslim community. â€ Both Mr. Akonjee and Mr. Miah were known as quiet scholars, devoted to the mosque and to their families. Mr. Akonjeeâ€™s sermons on Friday attracted nearly 200 worshipers, who heard him speak about the role of Islam in a diverse society in the United States. â€œHe conveyed a message of peace and harmony and quietness with your neighbors despite their religion, culture and race,â€ said Kobir Chowdhury, the president of Masjid   a nearby mosque in Brooklyn. Mosharraft Hossain said: â€œThe imam was our spiritual leader we worshiped with him five times a day. You canâ€™t imagine what weâ€™ve lost. â€ Murders have been rare over the years within the Bangladeshi community in and around Ozone Park. In July 2014, an activist leader with ties to Bangladeshi politics, Nazmul Islam, 55, was beaten to death in a robbery at 76th Street and Atlantic Avenue. Nestor Rodriguez, 22, and Carlos Genno, 25, both of Queens, were indicted on charges of   murder and are still awaiting trial. In August 2002, a photojournalist from Bangladesh, Mizanur Rahman, 37, was beaten to death in a midnight attack just over the county line in Brooklyn that appeared to have been the result of   and   fights. Hardy Marston, 18, and Rafael Santos, 27, were charged with murder, gang assault and criminal possession of a weapon. On Monday, many mourners expressed concern about an increasing   climate in New York. â€œI donâ€™t feel safe anymore,â€ Mr. Hossain said. â€œAll of this hatred being propagated, especially by Donald Trump, it puts us at risk. People sometimes pass me on the street and call me Bin Laden. I just try to keep my head down and keep walking. â€"
21155,Tim Kaine: Clinton Email Announcement â€œVery Troublingâ€ 11 Days Before Election,Brian Thomas,"Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine reveals that he thinks itâ€™s â€œvery troublingâ€ that the FBI told the press that they are taking a look at some recently released Clinton emails to determine relevancy to her case. 
Kaine believes that to do so this close to the election is inappropriate. 
Breitbart reports: 
During a portion of an interview set to air on Fridayâ€™s â€œVICE News Tonightâ€ on HBO Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) reacted to the FBIâ€™s announcement that it is taking another look at his running mate Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails by saying that doing this 11 days before the election without â€œmany details, but details are apparently being given by the FBI to the press, this is very, very troubling.â€ 
Kaine said, â€œWhen you do this 11 days before a presidential election, and you donâ€™t provide many details, but details are apparently being given by the FBI to the press, this is very, very troubling, and we hope that the director, and we really think that he should, give a clearer accounting of exactly whatâ€™s going on.â€ 
So the FBI should have kept it a secret until after the election, if you want Kaineâ€™s opinion. Sounds EXACTLY like the type of guy we want one breath from the presidency, right? 
And what exactly does Kaine mean by saying that the FBI â€œisnâ€™t providing many details, but details are apparently being givenâ€? 
This may sound inappropriate to Kaine, because anything that isnâ€™t positive about Clinton is inappropriate. 
Of course, it would be another matter altogether if this was about Trump."
21156,Half Of Russians Fear Syria Could Spark WW3,Alex Ansary,"Half Of Russians Fear Syria Could Spark WW3 11/02/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Almost half of all respondents in a recent Russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West caused by the ongoing crisis in Syria could develop into a global military conflict. 
The share of those who see the probability of World War Three in the near future as high or very high is now at 48 percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise 42 percent of society, the privately-owned public opinion research center Levada reported on Monday. The remaining 10 percent of respondents said they couldnâ€™t give a simple answer to the question. 
When researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that Russia and the West would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis, 35 percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely. Thirty-nine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and 26 percent said that they couldnâ€™t answer the question. 
Just over half â€“ 52 percent â€“ of Russians said they approve of their countryâ€™s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Just under a quarter â€“ 23 percent â€“ couldnâ€™t answer the question about their personal view on the subject. Those who thought that Russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided 49 percent against 28 percent respectively, with 24 percent finding the question too difficult to answer. 
The level of awareness about the situation in Syria and the Russian Air Force operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists there remained fairly high. Eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in Syria and 64 percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue. Just under a fifth â€“ 17 percent â€“ said that they were not interested in news about Syria. 
A similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent Levada Center showed that over 70 percent of Russian citizens supported the air operations against IS terrorists in Syria, and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for Russia to support the government of Syriaâ€™s democratically-elected President Bashar Assad. 
A different poll conducted earlier this month by the state-run research center VTSIOM showed that 73 percent of Russians believed that Western criticism of the air forceâ€™s counter-terrorism operation in Aleppo, Syria, was ungrounded and prejudiced. Only 6 percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Russian military have some basis in reality. 
Russia first deployed an air force contingent in Syria in 2015, after receiving a request for military help from the Syrian government, which is currently battling Islamic State and affiliated groups. Russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in Syria on September 30, 2015. Their work has aided the Syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country."
21157,"Distracted by Election 2016, No One Resisted the Deep Stateâ€™s Patriot Act 2",Waking Times,"
By Nathaniel Mauka
Congress overwhelmingly voted for the Patriot Act nearly 16 years ago, and our civil liberties have never been the same since. As if this singular bill, passed by George W. Bush, wasnâ€™t invasive enough, allowing big banks to demand our internet data, and more â€” the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ( CISA ) makes cyber-spying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it, a forgone conclusion.
As with most shadow government legislation, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances. CISA was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will. It also allows companies to mine data, under the auspices of government-created urgency.
The mere fact that this act passed in late 2015 is monumental, since it has been before Congress in different forms for over a decade . The election seems to have offered the perfect cover, as Americans and activists were too busy arguing over Trump vs. Hillary. 
Scott Talbott, senior vice president of government relations at the Electronic Transactions Association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of â€˜cyber threatsâ€™ outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties. Talbott states ,
â€œThe value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread,â€ he said. â€œBefore CISA, corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage. CISA allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy.â€ 
Who exactly would be determining if someone is a â€˜threatâ€™ is the meat of the sandwich, though. CISA is ripe for abuse, just as the Patriot Act has been.
The Patriot Act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people, without probable cause â€“ to enter their homes, or even to strip search them before theyâ€™ve been to court, had the opportunity to argue a case, or given â€˜authoritiesâ€™ a motive for this type of interrogation.
The stated purpose of the Patriot Act was to deter terrorist acts in the United States, but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country? CISA simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law.
More importantly, who specifically is CISA targeting? After multiple hackers have infiltrated computer systems at the White House , the State Department , the Pentagon , and the Office of Personnel Management, along with the Democratic National Committee , and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal, is the shadow government simply trying to create a stop-gap before their most elusive, yet damning information is made public?
CISA certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the National Security Agency (NSA) before former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed it.
â€œI think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start,â€ said Justin Harvey, CSO of Fidelis Cybersecurity, adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill â€“ to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur â€“ will result.
Under the guise of â€˜sharing cyber threatsâ€™ CISA allows companies to wholesale-collect information that may not even be a threat â€“ and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is, indeed a threat. If this sounds like circular logic â€“ it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill. Itâ€™s justifications for entering every possible orifice for data-gathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket.
The government can already enter your personal property including your home, your body , your cell, and your computer , but now they will have a legal in-roads to declare you a cyber-threat, simply for sending an email . This begs the question â€“ who is the real cyber-bully? CISA seems to be nothing more than a prevarication, covering the acts of an elite few who donâ€™t want their secrets exposed.

[American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told the Florida   that the soda splashed on an unspecified electronic device in the main cabin.  Airline passenger Preston Wake, 43, said he was drenched after a flight attendant spilled a soda. â€œI canâ€™t really tell you how far it went, but I was soaked,â€ Wake told the paper. â€œI had to change my clothes and everything. â€ Wake praised the airport staff for their hospitality despite the inconvenience the incident caused. â€œTheyâ€™ve been taking care of everybody and Iâ€™m very pleased with that,â€ Wake said. About 150 were aboard the Boeing 737 that landed at Jacksonville International Airport at 4:45 p. m. the Orlando Sentinel reported. The incident left passengers stranded at the airport until about 10 p. m."
21159,Social Circles Collide on a Dance Floor. Then a Brawl Ends in Death. - The New York Times,"Benjamin Mueller, Ashley Southall and Al Baker","Someone cut the music, and then from the kitchen came the crash of a utensil drawer being yanked out of a wooden cabinet. Vernon Hubbard stepped over tiles strewed with spatulas, spoons, purple plates and an unopened liter of soda. His eyelids were droopy, witnesses said, and in each hand he carried a steak knife. â€œNobodyâ€™s getting out of here alive,â€ he said from the apartment doorway, according to a witness. Others remembered a more lurid phrase: People, he warned, would be â€œleaving out in body bags. â€ Some partygoers sat   wedged together on a few living room couches. Others untangled themselves from a brawl that had grown out of a dance in the middle of the room. A woman shouted, â€œAll I want to do is go home. â€ In a     polyester shirt and Nikes, with brandy and beer blurring his thinking, Mr. Hubbard seemed barely able to stand, let alone hold anyone hostage. Around 30 people were marooned inside Apartment 15E at 645 Westchester Avenue, a public housing   around East 152nd Street in the South Bronx. Only one elevator was working. Some neighbors, to blunt the weekend noise, had taken sleeping pills and wedged mats in their entryways. A few people grabbed at Mr. Hubbardâ€™s arms, trying to get him to drop the knives. Others hid in a back bedroom. One woman called the police. Everybody screamed. Mr. Hubbard started swinging, witnesses and the police said  â€”   flailing, really. His arms were locked at the elbow, and his body tipped as he sliced the air. People saw knives flash inside a knot of bodies. Moments later, Julian Washington, a    man in a fitted Yankees hat, staggered into the buildingâ€™s hallway, bleeding. He had pushed his best friend, Tawana Vargas, out the door as the fight heated up, and she had been pacing the hallway waiting for him. Now, she pulled his left hand away from his head, figuring  â€”   hoping  â€”   that he had been smashed with a beer bottle, nothing worse. Blood spurted out of his neck, a few inches below his left ear, and it ran in rivulets down the beige bricks of the hallway wall. Mr. Washington choked on a few words, and then collapsed. Partygoers rushed out behind him, leaving bloody footprints on the floor. Ms. Vargas ran downstairs to look for a police officer. Balloons in purple, gold and black lost their helium and floated to the apartmentâ€™s linoleum tile floor. Napkins, ribbons and plastic cups were cracked and torn. They were all in purple, to celebrate the first year the partyâ€™s host, Darshonna Willoughby, who is Mr. Hubbardâ€™s cousin, had survived with lupus. Mr. Hubbard waited at the elevator bank. His leather jacket, investigators said, was covered in blood, on its collar and elbows and pockets. The one working elevator arrived. He showed little of the panic of someone who had just stabbed a man, the police said. At the foot of the   part of the St. Maryâ€™s Park Houses, he tossed a knife into the parking lot, witnesses said, waved his arm in vain for a cab and then lumbered toward the subway. Witnesses said the crime was so senseless and the getaway so inept that they had been moved, against their instincts, to point him out to police officers, who stopped him near the subway. On the 15th floor, one person crouched by Mr. Washingtonâ€™s side: Mr. Hubbardâ€™s sister, Cassandra Newbold, who had been fighting with Mr. Washington, too. She used his clothes to try to stop the bleeding. â€œI was trying to plug and patch and scream for help,â€ she said. â€œEverybody else that was at that party decided to flee the scene. â€ That image of a stampede of partygoers racing past Mr. Washingtonâ€™s   body haunts his brother, Guy Miller. â€œFor everybody just to walk over him, to leave him in the hallway by himself, thatâ€™s the crushing part,â€ Mr. Miller said. â€œIt seemed like he just died by himself, suffering, with nobody there. â€ Mr. Washington was pronounced dead at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center almost an hour later, at 12:53 a. m. on April 10. He became the sixth of 10 homicides logged this year in the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx, making it the second deadliest in New York City, behind the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn. Some accounts of that night are almost unrecognizable, comparing one with the next. The stories, blurred by heavy drinking, have refracted through friendships and family ties, and through a kaleidoscope of vantage points. The night started more simply. Mr. Washington lived in the apartment in East Harlem where his grandmother had raised him, but the hillside towers of the St. Maryâ€™s Park Houses were his second home. It was there, in Ms. Vargasâ€™s apartment on the ninth floor, that he would play Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, smoke cigarettes and debate voting for Bernie Sanders. He and Ms. Vargas had met in high school and dated before she came out as gay and he as bisexual. He was witty and   with a natural talent for dance, and he made fast friends around the housing project, where people called him Peaches. On April 9, a Saturday, he walked there over the Harlem River, his long legs carrying him almost as quickly as the subway could. On the stove in his apartment, Mr. Washington had left half a pot of seafood gumbo, a favorite dish among his friends that he hoped to perfect in culinary school someday soon. He met Ms. Vargas in her sisterâ€™s apartment in the same complex, where Mr. Washington sometimes stayed the night on a tattered couch beneath the windows. Mr. Washington was unemployed, but his friends were unwinding from long weeks at work. They passed around big bottles of Corona, the communion cup of their gatherings. From there, they bounced around an archipelago of public housing apartments, corner spots and hallways where they could hang out free of charge and unbothered, for the most part, by the police. Mr. Washington drank beer, got some food and talked up a recent WWE wrestling event with a younger friend. At each spot, they picked up a few more people. Ms. Vargas said she recently warned Mr. Washington about the danger lurking in her corner of the vast public housing landscape in the South Bronx. â€œDonâ€™t hang out in this building,â€ she said she told him. â€œThis area is just bad, period. Just stay in Harlem where you live. â€ But, she added, â€œJulian was just that type of person always looking for something. â€ Mr. Washington used to party in the West Village and at the nearby piers with a ragtag group of gay people, many of them black and Hispanic. But as gentrification marched toward the water, his circle lost that spot on the margins of the city, where they could let loose among strangers they trusted. Mr. Washington started spending more time in Bronx parks and housing projects. Shortly after 11 p. m. Mr. Washington got curious about the party for Ms. Willoughby on the 15th floor. They had not been invited, and none of them were dressed in purple, the color of lupus awareness, as an invitation had asked, so Mr. Washington walked down a flight of stairs to ask if they could join. â€œSo then he came back, he was like, â€˜Yes, itâ€™s lit, she said we can come down,â€™â€ Ms. Vargas said. For much of the night, the party had been relaxed. Mr. Hubbard had arrived around 6 p. m. People were sitting and talking on couches around the living room. Reggae and   hits were playing over the speakers, among them Rihannaâ€™s single â€œWork,â€ Mr. Washingtonâ€™s favorite song of the moment. It had something of the feeling of a family reunion. Ms. Willoughby had invited a number of her cousins, among them Mr. Hubbard, with whom she had reconnected only a few months earlier through her grandfather. He had come halfheartedly, his mother said in an interview. His sister, Ms. Newbold, asked him to bring food she had cooked: pans of pork shoulder, fried chicken, collard greens, crab salad and macaroni and cheese. Ms. Willoughby, wearing all black, cut the cake, which had two photos: one when she was in the hospital being treated for lupus, and another from when she had started feeling better. Mr. Hubbard, 35, looked out of place. A   chef who had entered foster care when he was 12, he had been spending much of his time at home since being stabbed in the spine with an ice pick last summer during a robbery or possible gang assault, his mother, Venice Quinones, said. He was overheard complaining to his sister about wanting to go home until she persuaded him to stay. And he was getting drunk. He said in a jailhouse interview that he was downing EJ brandy and Miller beer. â€œHe just looked crazy in his eyes  â€”   he looked crazy to me,â€ said Natasha Hill, a partygoer. â€œThey were red, and he looked like he had evil in his eyes. â€ The staid mood swung when Mr. Washington and his friends entered. They started dancing right away, despite the quizzical looks they were getting from the other partygoers, whom they did not know. The living room, 11 feet by 17 feet, swelled with people, some spilling into the hallway. â€œI think they were kind of taken aback by the fact that we were so hype,â€ Ms. Vargas recalled. She and Mr. Washington went into the sliver of a kitchen to pour themselves Georgi vodka. Ms. Newbold, in Army fatigue pants, seemed to take offense. â€œShe was like, â€˜Who yâ€™all with?â€™ or something along those lines,â€ Ms. Vargas said. Mr. Washington, gently needling his interrogator, answered, â€œBoo Boo Kitty, we good,â€ using the nickname for a character on the nighttime soap opera â€œEmpire. â€ The music turned from radio hits to more aggressive dance beats. People started dancing so hard that one attendee jokingly said to a friend that she thought someoneâ€™s head was going to fall off. A circle formed, and a friend of Mr. Washingtonâ€™s, Raldy Sanchez, started dancing near Ms. Newbold. The throbbing music seemed, from the start, like a volatile addition to the blend of alcohol and suspicion. Out of the tangle of bodies, no two people emerged with the same memory of what went wrong. In Mr. Sanchezâ€™s telling, he was dancing in a tight space, with Ms. Newbold and others pressing up against him, when out of nowhere, Mr. Hubbard yanked on a beaded necklace he was wearing. Mr. Sanchez said he threw a punch and shoved Mr. Hubbard to try to get him to back off, before three or four people jumped on him and started pummeling him. Mr. Washington and Ms. Vargas were in the kitchen, and they came running when they heard the commotion. They both threw punches, too. Mr. Washington, his friends said, tried to break up the fight and pushed his friends out of the apartment. Though Mr. Hubbardâ€™s swings hit Mr. Washington, the only person who was hurt, the police believe Mr. Sanchez had been his target. â€œThey were aiming for him, and his friend jumped in,â€ said Detective Jesus Rodriguez of the 40th Precinct detective squad. â€œJulian jumped in and saved him. Julian took the brunt of it. â€ Mr. Hubbard, who has pleaded not guilty to   murder and other charges, said in the interview that the fight gave him flashbacks to when he was stabbed last summer. But he denied killing Mr. Washington and said an explanation for the blood on his jacket would wait until September, when he is due back in court. The authorities, after wading through the various stories, said they gave credence to the view that Ms. Newbold and Mr. Hubbard were the ones who had escalated the fight. But Ms. Newbold said the brawl had started when she was dancing with her back to Mr. Sanchez and, out of nowhere, felt a push and landed face down on a couch. All of a sudden, Ms. Newbold said, several people were raining punches on her. She also said she heard a man yell, â€œGo get the heat,â€ referring to a gun. The police piled as many witnesses as they could into patrol cars and vans to take down their stories at the station house on Alexander Avenue. Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the detective squad, said the witnesses were separated so differences in their stories could not be smoothed over. â€œEveryoneâ€™s in a different corner,â€ Sergeant LoPuzzo said. Others came forward in the days after  â€”   a rarity in the South Bronx, where it can be risky to witness things. In the station house, Mr. Hubbard, carrying the stench of liquor, could not speak at first. Then he gave nonsensical answers, and he fell asleep. A couple of weeks after he was killed, Mr. Washingtonâ€™s funeral was held in a small, plush chapel in Harlem. He was known as a stylish man, and his attire at the funeral was something of a compromise: the linen suit his grandmother would have wanted him to wear, and the more casual   and fitted cap that reflected his own tastes. (He had been increasingly attached to the hat, too, as a way of hiding his bald spot.) The observances in some ways resembled the family reunion that Mr. Washington had been trying to orchestrate in his last months. He had been separated from his siblings at age 5, when his mother put him and a younger brother into a cab by themselves, his older brother, Mr. Miller, said. When they arrived at a relativeâ€™s home with unexplained burns on their backs, someone called the cityâ€™s child welfare agency. The siblings soon were scattered across the city  â€”   some to foster homes, and others to relatives. Mr. Washington was taken in by his grandmother, a churchgoing woman who sent him to ballet classes and took him on trips to Europe. His mother became addicted to drugs, and though Mr. Washington still struggled with feelings of resentment, he had been trying in recent months to find a few lost siblings and bring everyone together for a gathering. He was also still, seven years after his grandmotherâ€™s death, trying to climb out of the depression that had started after her passing. When Mr. Miller went into his brotherâ€™s apartment after his death, he discovered that Mr. Washington had gotten rid of all of her old furniture. Eviction notices were piling up. After the funeral, Mr. Washingtonâ€™s family held a repast in the basement of the Storefront Academy Harlem, a grade school he attended. Over plates of fried chicken prepared by his mother, peopleâ€™s tears gave way to happier recollections. Rihanna blared out of a few speakers. Everyone was dressed in white. Without anyone seeming to mean to, a circle of friends and family formed around an open stretch of floor. Into the middle burst Mr. Miller, in immaculate white   and Mr. Washingtonâ€™s uncle, Dasean Miller, who wore a heavy,   jacket. Before anyone could process it, their bodies were a whirl of white cloth, top hats and gold chains. â€œItâ€™s crazy because this is what we were doing that night,â€ Ms. Vargas whispered. â€œAnd thatâ€™s Julian,â€ she said, pointing to Guy Miller. â€œHe dances just like Julian. â€"
21160,One of the Most Undervalued Storable Survival Foods,Ryan Banister,"23 Preparedness is more than a method of planning, it is a lifestyle. Long-term survival strategies are most effective when they are incorporated into oneâ€™s daily life. Anybody who seeks to be prepared for the future should be prepared to live out their plans in the present, even if the only purpose is to understand the efficacy of their plans. Food preparedness stands paramount as the most fundamental element of any long-term survival plan, and it is important that your preparations for long-term food storage are efficacious and simple.
Food Preparedness As impending socioeconomic collapse fast approaches, many of the commercially available storable foods have risen in popularity, and for good reason, but many of these so-called foods are pre-packaged freeze-dried meals , powders or just plain mush that are intended to sit in storage for up to 2 years. Consequently, these foods contain a high amount of sodium and/or preservatives to maintain their shelf life; they are designed only â€œfor emergencyâ€ and not as a nutritional food that could be eaten in oneâ€™s daily regimen today. Over time, many of the storable foods that people rely on, especially canned foods, contain meat which will putrefy and cause all other food in the package to spoil. How likely is it that these foods will sustain your survival and nutritional needs when the time comes?
The food you choose to store should be something that you are comfortable eating today, and it should be providing what you need to stay healthy.
What You Need These are the basic requirements that a food should have for long-term survival:
It must be inexpensive. It must have the capacity for long-term storage (Check out these 25 must-have survival foods ) It must be a calorie-dense food that yields significant nutritional benefits. It must have a number of uses so that it can be incorporated into your diet today. When searching for the best long-term survival food, the one food that seems to match every basic quality mentioned above is seeds. There are various seeds which are substantially inexpensive as compared with many of the other commercially available long-term food storage products on the market, and they are perfect for long-term storage if they are stored correctly. Here we will discuss two highly nutritious and widely available seeds and give you a number of ideas as to how you can use them in your diet now.
Chia Seeds 
Salvia hispanica, also known as chia, is a member of the mint family and is native to Southern Mexico and Guatemala. The seed of this plant was once a staple food for Inca, Maya and Aztec civilizations. Chia seeds are considered a complete protein because they contain all 9 essential amino acids: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, and histadine. They are also a great source of omega-3 ALA fatty acids, which have been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease when converted to omega-3 EPA and DHA in the body. One tablespoon of chia seeds provides approximately 2.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids. They are also a good source of cholesterol-lowering soluble fiber and lignans which have shown a potential role in cancer prevention . These seeds provide 80 calories per tablespoon, and they would serve as a highly efficacious way to obtain sufficient calories if there is ever a food supply shortage as a result of a natural or unnatural disaster.
Chia seeds are highly absorbent; they will absorb up to 12 times their weight in water. They are best eaten after being soaked in a liquid of some kind, where they will soak up moisture and form a gel-like consistency. Once soaked, they could be added to a number of beverages or foods. They are commonly added to fruit drinks. Another easy way to consume eat chia seeds is to add them to cereal or to add them to a fruit jam and spread them on toast. They do not have a very strong taste, so they will tend to taste like whatever you mix them with.
Hemp Seeds 
The hemp plant, also known as cannabis sativa, has been used by humans for over 10,000 years for industrial and commercial uses, such as the creation of clothing, rope, paper, fabric, biofuel, biodegradable plastic, paint, and food. The seed of the hemp plant is full of nutrition , and it could possibly be the ultimate survival food. In addition, to be a complete protein source, hemp seeds are a particularly good source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, but hemp seeds actually have almost twice the omega-3 content as chia. Hemp provides 4.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids and 90 calories per tablespoon.
Hemp seeds have a subtle, nutty flavor, and they taste great when added to a shake. Similarly to chia, they can be added to a cereal or spread on toast with jam. They also taste great when added to a salad.
Storage 
Both chia and hemp seeds can last up to two years if stored properly. Preparing a cool, dry place will be necessary for any long-term storage strategy. A cellar would make an ideal location, because it is underground and undisturbed by household heating systems, however, for those who do not have underground storage available, a refrigerator will do just fine. The amount you need to store will be dependent on how many people are in your home and how much space you have. The best idea is to store at least two-weeks-worth of seeds at any given time to ensure long-term survival.

21161,"â€˜As Blacks, We Were Born as We Areâ€™: Our Top 10 Comments - The New York Times",Lela Moore and Sona Patel,"Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. 1. As an   female, I understand the plight for equality. However, I am severely offended by the continual comparison of a sexual preference, a gender preference, to the plight of an enslaved, raped, lynched, brutalized, oppressed people. Dare anyone compare choice of bathroom to the plight of blacks for the past 400 years? Isnâ€™t that a bit ridiculous? First of all, itâ€™s insulting to every black person in America. As blacks we were born as we are. No choice involved. Transgenders have to make a conscious choice to become a transgender. There is no comparison. People say that Christians force their beliefs on others. Well, people who take these actions and measures are forcing their beliefs on those who donâ€™t agree. There is nothing wrong with a person who prefers to use the bathroom with people of the same gender by birth. Stop making it seem like it is. Thatâ€™s judgmental and degrading.  â€”   Lovesâ€™ Redemption in Washington, reacting to an article about the Obama administration telling public schools to allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identities. 2. Itâ€™s past time to admit that when it comes to upholding federal law, and even civil rights, many states have pretty much just flipped off the U. S. government, many federal rulings, and even the U. S. Constitution. Itâ€™s now necessary for the U. S. government to bring the hammer down and start insisting that civil rights rulings are not optional, nor are they open to debate, overruling, or corruption by any state. Either we are a nation with universal civil rights that are enforceable or we are not. Itâ€™s time to make them stick.  â€”   GWBear in Florida. This comment received over 200 reader recommendations.  3. As I listen to Mr. Sanders speak tonight  â€”   completely caught up in his own hubris  â€”   I am fascinated and repulsed by his angry entitlement to the Democratic nomination. As he was shouting about momentum and that he is the best candidate  â€”   despite the fact that three million more voters preferred Mrs. Clinton  â€”   I feel increasingly concerned that he is a huge liability to the party he adopted for his own convenience.  â€”   Dana in Santa Monica, Calif. reacting to an article about Senator Bernie Sandersâ€™s victory in the West Virginia primary. This comment received over 1, 090 reader recommendations and 127 reader responses. 4. I am absolutely astounded at the way these analyses ignore the obvious: The Trump phenomenon is the backlash against our first black president. Come on! You go back decades dissecting American conservatism, and you somehow manage not to mention that Donald Trump headed the â€œBirtherâ€ movement, which gave racists the okay to assert that Barack Obama was not a real American  â€”   explicitly because he was alleged (falsely) to have been born in Africa? HELLO? Are we ever going to be allowed to discuss this elephant in the living room? Are we supposed to pretend FOREVER that the origins of this outburst of hatred are totally mysterious?  â€”   DW in Philadelphia, reacting to an article about the Republican Partyâ€™s failure to unite behind its presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump. This comment received over 1, 680 reader recommendations and 33 reader responses.  5. Keep writing away. It doesnâ€™t matter what you say, I am still going to vote for him. The more I read against him, the more I want to vote for him.  â€”   Chris in Louisville, Ky. reacting to a post about Mr. Trump refusing to release his tax returns. 6. How many of us believe that the Olympics and every other competition actually award medals for achievement, rather than for who cheats most successfully? Of course, athletes also train. For strength and skill and endurance. But who does it without drugs? Itâ€™s not just the cheating that bothers me, but the effect on young people who do it. The effect of that lifelong secrecy. The effect of knowing that their medal was gained by cheating. Itâ€™s very discouraging.  â€”   TheraP in the Midwest, reacting to an article about the former chief of Russiaâ€™s antidoping lab detailing a   doping effort  in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. 7. Great, another special interest group to pander to.  â€”   MKM in New York, reacting to an article about Hillary Clinton vowing that as president she would unseal the government records about Area 51, reputed to contain classified information about aliens and U. F. O. s. 8. Colonialism was pretty rude too, Your Majesty.  â€”   Viraj Vaidya on The Timesâ€™s Facebook page, responding to an article about Queen Elizabeth IIâ€™s criticism of a visiting Chinese delegation, which was caught on a video.  This comment received over 1, 700 likes. 9. I find it so ironic that people do these things to their body in the name of â€œindividuality. â€ The inked and pierced masses are the real sheep.  â€”   Lena in Ontario, Canada, reacting to an article about body modifications like tattoos, piercings and ear gauging becoming de rigueur on fashion runways.  10. Brazil will not change. The problem with our country and economy is not the president herself, but our senators and everyone else whoâ€™s been stealing, and ruining our country for their personal gain. Iâ€™m sad to say that, even though I donâ€™t support Dilma and never voted for her, whatâ€™s coming is much, much worse than her. I fear for the future of my country.  â€”   VitÃ³ria Fernandes on The Timesâ€™s Facebook page, responding to an article about impeachment proceedings against Brazilâ€™s president, Dilma Rousseff."
21162,(((Smithsonian))) Refuses to Include Judge in Black Museum Because He has Normal People Opinions,Eric Striker,"(((Smithsonian))) Refuses to Include Judge in Black Museum Because He has Normal People Opinions 
Eric Striker October 27, 2016 Dat nigga ainâ€™t even smoke crack. 
The Smithsonian Museum, run by American Jewish Committee award-winning mankind harasser (((David J. Skorton))), has decided to exclude Supreme Court Justice Judge Clarence Thomas from its African-American Museum, showing that Jews only want to empower certain kinds of blacks that advance Jew-specific agendas. This Jew gets to decide who gets into the black museum and who doesnâ€™t. 
While I donâ€™t agree with Thomasâ€™ conservative philosophy, he has long been a constitution-respecting thorn in the side of the Jewish activist judge bloc of Ginsburg, Breyer and Kagan. Whenever these Jews (and Sotomayor, along with the Jew Merrick Garland if he gets confirmed) vote to get something insane through, Thomas has been a reliable voice of reason tempering and often downvoting them in defense of free speech, freedom of association, etc. 
Coming from a background of poverty and homelessness, Thomas has genuinely worked hard and shown remarkable aptitude in the art of jurisprudence, he wasnâ€™t appointed to fill an Affirmative Action quota. He is a member of the â€œtalented tenthâ€ of the black race and if thereâ€™s going to be an African-American museum, he has certainly earned his place in it, yet wonâ€™t be included , because he has refused to abuse his gavel in pursuit of violent anti-White discord. Rather than commending him for his legal ethic, Jews are punishing him by obliterating his memory as soon as he dies to serve as an example to any other unusually intelligent blacks out there. 
Itâ€™s not a secret that Jews filter just who and what Negroes in America should aspire to, from founding the pro-race mixing NAACP and sabotaging black nationalist Marcus Garvey, to running virtually all media intended for black people (BET-owned by Sumner Redstoneâ€™s Viacom, or The Root Ã‚ â€“Ã‚ run by Israeli citizen Haim Sabanâ€™s Univision), and now picking and choosing what individuals blacks should exemplary members of their race. 
So who is being included? 
Well, the African-American Museum has an entire section dedicated to the Jewish-financed and extreme anti-white Black Panthers , Black Lives Matter, convicted Cultural Marxist terrorist Angela Davis. Examples of some of the ideological indoctrination featured at this Jewseum. Is (((Gloria Steinem))) â€œAfrican-Americanâ€? So why is she there? 
Cracked out James Brown, famous for shuckinâ€™ and jivinâ€™ while smoking crack and not much else, is according to reports treated by the Smithsonian as the second coming of Christ. 
Is that appropriate? 
I wonâ€™t go as far as to claim that blacks would be astrophysicists if all Jews vanished tomorrow, but I will say that blacks would not only be far better off according to every metric, they also would instinctively respect and emulate the White man as Booker T. Washington believed they should, rather than lash out at us for no reason as Jews instruct them to. 
Blacks in the 1930â€™s once had a crime rate lower than urban Italian and Irish in the law and order South, along with their own small businesses, farms, fairly in-tact families. But because the Jew capitalizes on dysfunctional societies full of dysfunctional people, James Brown is made immortal while they pretend Clarence Thomas ainâ€™t a REAL nigga . 
Jewish cultural mandate socializes some Whites into acting like low-lives as well. While the manifestations are different depending on natural temperament and abilities of race, one thing we can all agree on is that neither the White man nor the black man are living up to their full potential in this age of decline and decay."
21163,One Treaty Could Change the Fight to Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline,Yessenia Funes,"Tweet Widget by Yessenia Funes 
The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline isnâ€™t only about water rights and sacred sites; itâ€™s also about the U.S. governmentâ€™s historical refusal to honor treatiesâ€”when â€œthey interfered with Manifest Destiny.â€ Washington violated its treaty with the Sioux in 1877, and later declared its power to void all Native treaties. â€œThere are now talks of using the treaty to legally regain land rights to end the pipeline's construction.â€ One Treaty Could Change the Fight to Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline by Yessenia Funes 
This article previously appeared in ColorLines and Portside . 
â€œ Highway 1806 has become the no surrender line.â€ 
When activists talk about the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline [1] and the Native uprising surrounding its construction, they often frame it with regard to the environment. Water. Sacred burial grounds. Grandmother Earth. 
Opponents site potential environmental risks to water resources like the Missouri and Mississippi rivers to defend their stance against the 1,172-mile long pipeline, which would have the capacity to transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Bakken oilfields of North Dakota to markets across the U.S. 
What many ignore, however, is another facet of the #NoDAPL [2] movement: Native sovereignty. 
Most of the confrontations between water protectors and law enforcement are occurring near the Standing Rock Reservation. The reservation currently takes up roughly 3,625 square miles [3] across southeastern North Dakota and into South Dakota. More than 8,000 people [4] live in scattered communities, all connected by a common historyâ€”one which includes land theft and treaty violations. 
The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline has brought this history to the current day. â€œOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours,â€ says Cody Hall, a Lakota civil rights activist with the Cheyenne River Tribe who has spent time on the frontlines in North Dakota. 
When he speaks of â€œtreaty land,â€ heâ€™s referring to land allotted to the Great Sioux Nation by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 and 1868. 
â€œOur standoff is on treaty land, so we have every right to defend what is rightfully ours.â€ 
The revised treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation in 1868, which the federal governement would eventually shrink to what became the Standing Rock Reservation. The treaty land crisscrossed between seven present-day statesâ€”North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Montanaâ€”including the reservation and unceded territories reserved for hunting. 
These boundaries were created to ensure peace between Native people and colonizers. The temptations of gold, however, meant that travelers were soon in tribal territory. Almost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens' entry onto Native land. 
For Native Americans, treaties function as the law of the land. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution clearly states: 
This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. 
The U.S. government would honor treatiesâ€”until they interfered with Manifest Destiny. â€œIt was all about colonial expansion,â€ says Frank Pommersheim, a professor at the University of South Dakota School of Law who specializes in Indian law. In 1877, without consent from the Sioux, the United States stole their sacred Black Hills. The land was the center of their world, their birthplace. 
This act set in stone U.S.-tribal relations. From then on, the United States slowly diminished the land it left for tribal peoples. By 1889, the Great Sioux Reservation became what it is today: 3,625 square miles tucked between North and South Dakota, stripped of ancestral burial grounds and lush buffalo populations with which the Sioux used to coexist. 
In 1903, fewer than 30 years after the Black Hills seizement, the Supreme Court ruled in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock [5] that Congress may unilaterally break treaties between the U.S. and Native Americans using its plenary power. â€œIt is unfortunately a part of American law. That basic precept is totally unacceptable to Native people in the context of treaties,â€ Pommersheim explains. ""It is just a collision between cultures and different understandings and interpretation of what treaties actually mean."" 
â€œAlmost immediately after its conception in 1851, the U.S. violated the treaty by not policing its citizens' entry onto Native land.â€ 
He is correct that a vast number of Native Americans find this unacceptable. 
â€œTo us [these treaties] are very much still alive and a part of our everyday life,â€ says Remi Bald Eagle, the intergovernmental affairs coordinator for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. â€œWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.â€ 
And while the U.S. has violated said treaties over the past century, itâ€™s never declared the treaties null or void, Bald Eagle adds. 
With the Treaty of Fort Laramie in mind, water protectors opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline have tried to take action. On October 23, pipeline opponents declared eminent domain [6] over land owned by Energy Transfer, the company behind the pipeline, by citing the treaty. Joye Braun, an Indigenous Environmental Network organizer, said in a statement: 
We have never ceded this land. If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland. We are here to protect the burial sites here. Highway 1806 has become the no surrender line. 
The Sacred Ground Camp had already existed for over a month with about 300 people camped out, but occupiers extended the camp on October 23 by creating three road blockades to prevent militarized law enforcement from entering. (This came just a day after police arrested roughly 127 water protectors [7] directly across the road from where private security for Energy Transfer had unleashed dogs [8] on activists one month earlier.) The camp also intended to halt construction where the remaining proposed pipeline route would connect with the Missouri River. 
Four days after declaring eminent domain for the camp, on October 27, law enforcement from seven states arrived there fully equipped with riot gear, all-terrain vehicles, armored vehicles and helicopters. They arrested 141 water protectors [9]â€”after beating them with batons and issuing pepper spray. Law enforcement ultimately destroyed the camp, along with its tipis and sweat lodges. 
â€œWe did everything in our power that we could do to defend our camp in a nonviolent approach,â€ says Cody Hall of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. â€œBecause the only way to really defend it would have became a violent approach because you're meeting officers with a force of weaponry.â€ 
â€œWe still honor those treaties, and I know the chairman has said that he expects America to do the same.â€ 
There are now talks of using the treaty to legally regain land rights to end the pipeline's construction, according to Hall and others on-site. There is a precedent for taking this approach: In May, the Lummi in Washington state called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a coal terminal permit on the premise that it would harm Lummi fishing grounds, which the federal government is legally mandated to protect per an 1855 treaty. The Lummi won [10]. No terminal was built, fishing grounds were not harmed and the treaty was honored. 
â€œ[DAPL] brings to the surface all the issues dealing with treaties,"" says Bald Eagle. ""It brings up all the wrongdoings that have been happening in the past. The American government has repeatedly shoved all of their wrongdoings underneath the rug, and the issue with the Dakota Access Pipeline has pulled that rug off, and now we have to look at everything thatâ€™s been done wrong.â€ 
He lays out three choices for the U.S. government: correct its wrongs, put the rug back or commit another wrong. 
President Barack Obama [11], when interviewed by social media news site NowThis, stated that the Corps is figuring out [12] how to reroute the pipeline over the next several weeks, saying, ""There is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans."" But construction has nearly reached the Missouri River, sacred water for the Sioux. Several more weeks may be too late. Yessenia Funes is the climate justice reporter for Colorlines.

21164,The FBI's Clinton Investigation Is Wider Than Assumed,b,"The FBI's Clinton Investigation Is Wider Than Assumed 
The Washington Post editors today added to their hypocrisy with three additional anti-Comey op-eds: Comeyâ€™s mistaken quest for transparency 
I interpret that as naked fear that their candidate Hillary Clinton may now loose. That fear is justified. 
The Wall Street Journal today added to its so far excellent reporting on the Clinton issues by revealing the much bigger story behind it: FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe - Laptop may contain thousands of messages sent to or from Mrs. Clintonâ€™s private server (open copy here ). 
According to the reporting, based on FBI sources, FBI agents in New York and elsewhere have been looking into the Clinton Foundation for several months. They suspect that this ""charity"" was selling political favors by then Secretary of State Clinton in exchange for donations that personally benefited the Clinton family. 
The Justice Department blocked further aggressive investigations into the issue, allegedly because of the ongoing election. A high FBI official, Andrew McCabe, also showed disinterest in a further pursuit of the issue. McCabe's wife had just tried to get elected as state senator and had receive a campaign donation of nearly $500,000 from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton friend and at times board member of the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents pursuing the investigation into the Clinton Foundation were not amused. 
The separate investigation into former Congressman Weiner for sexual contacts with minors was looking for pedophile stuff on Weiner's electronic devices. It didn't find any as far as we can tell, but found some 650,000 emails archived on a laptop. Several thousand of these emails were sent or received by Weiner's spouse, the intimate Clinton aide Huma Abedin. They came through Clinton's private email server. At least some of these thousands of emails are likely copies of those that were deleted from Clinton's server when the (separate) investigation into it started. They may be evidence that Clinton sent and received classified documents through her unsecured system. Some of these emails may also contain serious dirt related to the Clinton Foundation. 
Thus we have three ongoing FBI investigations: into Clinton's private email-server used illegally for official State Department business; into the Clinton Foundation and its role in peddling political influence in exchange for donations; into the personal conduct of Anthony Weiner. 
Additional investigations that may come up are on: the mixing of donations to the Clinton Foundation and personal compensation for Bill Clinton for holding highly paid speeches; for profit activities by the group of people running Bill Clinton's businesses as well as the Clinton Foundation financing; inappropriate hindering of the FBI investigations by the Justice Department and/or by McCabe. 
With such a list of potentially very serious scandals pending it is highly understandable that FBI director Comey went public and did not follow the advice from the Justice Department to pursue these issues only on a reduced level. It would have been political suicide to try to keep this silent. Way too many FBI agents eager to pursue these case were in the known and would have talked, as they do now, to the media. 
If Clinton gets elected she will be hampered by these scandals for the next two years. The Republicans in Congress will jump on these issues as soon as possible. There will be endless hearings with large media coverage. The only question is when the first attempts at an impeachment process will be made - before or after she moves back into the White House. She and her family may be better off with her losing the campaign. Posted by b on October 31, 2016 at 03:19 PM | Permalink"
21165,Theranosâ€™s Fate Rests With a Founder Who Answers Only to Herself - The New York Times,Reed Abelson,"Itâ€™s all up to Elizabeth Holmes. Theranos, a   lab started and led by Ms. Holmes that promised to revolutionize the industry, is now under criminal investigation and faces increasing skepticism about whether its core technology works. Several federal agencies are looking into the companyâ€™s operations. Ms. Holmes herself may have to answer to federal regulators about what she told investors. Just last year, Theranos was a Silicon Valley favorite with a $9 billion valuation. Now, depending on the outcome of the investigations, including the threat of crippling sanctions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the company could be forced out of business and Ms. Holmes could lose her position as chief executive. The troubles have led to a cascade of questions about what changes Theranos might make to rebuild its reputation and business prospects. Some have even said that Ms. Holmes should step aside. After more than six months of intense questions, though, changes have been limited. And whatever future moves the company makes are up to Ms. Holmes. She  â€”   not the investors, and not even the board  â€”   controls the switches. Ms. Holmes, a    Stanford University dropout, owns a majority interest in Theranos, a privately held company she founded in 2003. She is also the companyâ€™s chairwoman and chief executive. What she wants done at her company, she can demand. Ms. Holmes declined to be interviewed. But in an extended interview, David Boies, a heavyweight lawyer who is one of three outside directors on the Theranos board, hinted that some management changes may be coming soon. â€œThe board is right now in the process, and Elizabeth Holmes is in the process, of adding significant talent to the company,â€ he said. But an adviser to the company, Richard Kovacevich, a former chief executive at Wells Fargo, acknowledged the limited role played by anyone other than Ms. Holmes. â€œShe doesnâ€™t have to answer anything she doesnâ€™t want to,â€ he said. The situation at Theranos offers a stark reminder of the perils of investing in Silicon Valley, where it is common for founders to control a company, leaving boards with little real power, including over who should be chief executive. The examples are legion, including huge success stories like Google and Facebook. The upside for venture capitalists is that betting on an individual and getting in early can lead to riches. But if trouble brews, it is nearly impossible for a board or anyone but the founder to make any changes  â€”   a risk that, for now at least, investors remain willing to make. â€œFor every Theranos, thereâ€™s a Facebook,â€ said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock, a leading venture capital firm. Even in a case like Zenefits, where its founder, Parker Conrad, stepped down as chief executive in February after regulatory problems emerged, the decision to resign was ultimately his. Theranosâ€™s board, which in its early years included some of its large investors, was later composed of an array of diplomatic, military and political leaders, including former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and former Senator Bill Frist. Last year, the company divided the directors into advisers and an actual governing board, which includes Mr. Boies, whose law firm represents Theranos. While critics have pointed to the boardâ€™s lack of industry expertise and the advanced age of some advisers, Mr. Boies defended it as â€œextraordinarily qualified. â€ But legal experts say that while the directors are responsible for representing the interests of all investors, Ms. Holmes does not have to listen. A founder with controlling interest can replace the board, so directors are ultimately left with the choice of being fired or resigning if they strongly disagree with the executive. Supervoting shares, another common practice among   grant founders like Ms. Holmes even more power. â€œYouâ€™re practically a paper tiger and have fiduciary responsibility,â€ said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. Mr. Boies says Ms. Holmes has the boardâ€™s backing. â€œI think the board has complete confidence in Elizabeth Holmes as a founder of the company, as a scientist and as an administrator,â€ he said. The board is represented by an independent law firm, Mr. Boies said, which is answering queries from the United States attorneyâ€™s office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as conducting an independent investigation into whether Theranos made proper disclosures to investors. No formal accusations have been made. While Theranos is privately held, its investors still have protections, said Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford. â€œThe federal securities laws have very strict   provisions, and they apply to sophisticated investors, not just unsophisticated ones. â€ But Mr. Kovacevich, who is also an investor, emphasized that Theranos was not a publicly held company with the same responsibilities and that the shareholders understood this. â€œNot only is this a private company, but it has also been stated to the world, to the board and stockholders, that she has no intentions of ever going public,â€ he said of Ms. Holmes. â€œThe intention, and a strong intention, is that this company is going to be private forever. â€ The Medicare investigation is the most pressing threat, and Mr. Boies is largely mum about what Theranos is planning and how the board is reacting. Theranos has been the subject of scathing coverage in The Wall Street Journal, which has relentlessly questioned the reliability and safety of its blood tests, and it is under intense regulatory scrutiny. â€œThe exact focus of what needs to be done keeps changing,â€ Mr. Boies said. Medicare, concerned about the companyâ€™s California operations, has said Theranos could face severe sanctions if the company does not adequately address the deficiencies uncovered last year. Theranosâ€™s California lab certification could be revoked, and Ms. Holmes and the companyâ€™s chief operating officer could be barred from the industry for two years. The lab and its procedures have been overhauled, Mr. Boies said. Ms. Holmes has hired new management to run the lab, and because the people who ran it previously did not report directly to her, he said he hoped the agency would not take punitive action against her. The companyâ€™s other lab, in Arizona, which performs more traditional tests, continues to draw customers, he noted. But Theranos still faces extraordinary skepticism about whether its main technology works, especially given its history of secretiveness, and Mr. Boies said Theranos was taking steps to address the doubts. He pointed to plans to finally publish its results in   journals and the addition of some   individuals to its scientific advisory board. â€œWeâ€™ve got to reveal much more about the proprietary technology than is desirable,â€ given the risk of companiesâ€™ and countriesâ€™ copying what Theranos does, Mr. Boies said. The companyâ€™s intellectual property is essentially its main asset, and if the technology works, some observers say, the company could remain a viable business. â€œI donâ€™t think theyâ€™re beyond salvage, beyond redemption,â€ said Lakshman Ramamurthy, an industry consultant with extensive regulatory experience. But while he did not rule out a sale, Mr. Boies dismissed the idea of handing Theranos over to the highest bidder. â€œThis technology is not going to be sold to somebody who wants to just make more profits from it and charge what is charged today,â€ he said. And, as Mr. Kovacevich emphasized, Ms. Holmes will ultimately determine what happens next. â€œYou have to ask Ms. Holmes what the steps are,â€ he said."
21166,UN vote calling for end to Cuban embargo adopted with US and Israel abstaining,nan,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:23 UTC Â© Carlos Barria / Reuters The US government abstained from the UN vote on a resolution calling for an end to the US economic embargo against Cuba, for the first time in 24 years. The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution with 191 votes in favor on Wednesday. The only other abstention, besides the US, was Israel. The vote is non-binding but it can have political weight. Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez described the abstention as a ""positive step for the future of improving relations between the United States and Cuba,"" according to Reuters. Rodriguez said in September that the embargo cost Cuba $4.6 billion last year, and the full damage over the length of the 50-year embargo was estimated at $125.9 billion. When it was first announced that the US government would abstain from the vote, the entire General Assembly applauded. ""Abstaining on this resolution does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government. We do not,"" Samantha Power the US Ambassador to the United Nations told the General Assembly on Tuesday. ""We are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people,"" she said, according to AP. The Obama administration began normalizing relations with the Communist-run country in at the end of 2014, easing trade and travel restrictions. On July 20, 2015, diplomatic relations were restored, and embassies in the two countries were reopened. Lifting the full embargo will take the support of the Republican-run Congress, which remains critical of the administration's efforts, arguing it offered too many concessions to Cuba and accepted little in return, especially on human rights and the restoration of expropriated property. Obama made the first visit to Havana by a US president in 88 years in March."
21167,Hillary: â€œWe Did Not Lose A Single Important Person In Libyaâ€,nan,"Email 

Hillary Clinton declared during NBC Newsâ€™s Commander-in-Chief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans â€“ including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens â€“ were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. 
â€œThat was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we donâ€™t make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it,â€ Clinton argued. â€œAs with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As Iâ€™ve said, the operation was a success.â€ 
She continued, â€œSo much so, in fact, that Iâ€™m proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties; however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy.â€ 
â€œPolitics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while weâ€™re on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly,â€ she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. 
She said, â€œBut all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agentsâ€™ work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadnâ€™t been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA.â€ 
â€œIâ€™m sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal. Because, in the words of a personal friend of mine, who is a former CIA spook â€“ shutting down arms dealers is easy; finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part,â€ she concluded."
21168,Ben Sasse Thinks Biden Would Have Won - The New York Times,Ana Marie Cox,"Weâ€™re 11 weeks into the Trump administration. Whatâ€™s the Senate like these days? I think that the institution  â€”   and I do mean all 535 people, but particularly the hundred in the Senate  â€”   is filled with really nice and   people. Iâ€™ve been there 27 months. But whoâ€™s counting? My average duration in a job is more like six months, because Iâ€™ve done crisis and turnaround stuff for two decades. Iâ€™ve been in a lot of companies and    and institutions that were really on fire in a lot of ways, the Senate is the least urgent, least serious institution Iâ€™ve ever worked in. Thereâ€™s this constant fighting. You should agree on what youâ€™re arguing about before you argue: We are either going to work at our house tonight or weâ€™re going to make dinner together and play music in the living room or weâ€™re going to go out to eat and go to a movie. But the problem is that, at this particular juncture, thereâ€™s also a question of whether this hypothetical movie theater even exists. Why are you playing to this outdated, modernist idea that there are objective facts? [Laughs.] What is wrong with you? We do have to agree on some basic facts, despite this general reluctance to grant them legitimacy. Yeah, itâ€™s a huge problem. I sit in the late Daniel Patrick Moynihanâ€™s seat on the Senate floor. Heâ€™s the author of the saying, Everyoneâ€™s entitled to their own opinion, but youâ€™re not entitled to your own facts. Look at trade and automation: two competing but slightly overlapping forces in the shrinking of the duration of jobs right now. We have to be able to talk honestly about how disrupted this world is going to be, and it is crazy to mislead people and say weâ€™re going to bring back all of the big factory jobs by creating a protectionist regime. That isnâ€™t true. Do you think that infighting creates a situation in which everyday Americans write off all politicians as cheaters and liars? It might explain how Donald Trump won, because it didnâ€™t make any difference to anybody that he seemed immoral  â€”   they thought of him as no worse than every other politician. I would argue pretty vociferously that itâ€™s also because of who his opponent was. If Joe Biden would have run against Donald Trump, Biden would have won in a landslide. You have been a constant critic of Trump, even during the primaries. I campaigned with pretty much anybody not named Trump or Huckabee. Including Ted Cruz. Your book, which argues that Americaâ€™s youths are largely coddled and ill equipped to compete in the global economy, is full of references to ancient history and philosophy. Are you trying to unseat Cruz as the intellectual of the Senate? I donâ€™t see what Iâ€™m trying to do as trying to be the intellectual in the Senate. What is it that youâ€™re trying to do? Iâ€™m the third or fourth most conservative guy by voting record in the institution, and yet most of the stuff I care about is not really partisan. We have had no foreign policy for the past 28 years for dealing with a   War world. And now you layer on nonstate actors, like jihadis, who have a presence in a quarter to a third of all the countries in the world, and the governments in those countries arenâ€™t the main source of power anymore. But that isnâ€™t anywhere near what keeps the spies and generals up at night, about how cyberattacks will transform war and create all these gray areas that arenâ€™t quite war but are warlike. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine what the obvious    answer looks like, with the divide between the two parties in trying to figure out a   strategy in this new age."
21169,Ann Patchettâ€™s Guide for Bookstore Lovers - The New York Times,Ann Patchett,"The pilgrims have been coming to Nashville for as long as the Grand Ole Opry has been on the radio. They come for Fan Fair and Taylor Swift concerts or just to walk down Lower Broad in cowboy boots. Parents visit their children in college. Conventioneers deplane by the thousands. Nashville is a hip city now, with a food scene, an art scene and two poorly performing professional sports teams. With all the reasons to travel to Nashville, one might be surprised to learn that some people come just to see a small independent bookstore. Itâ€™s true. The Book Faithful journey to Music City because they still like their novels printed on paper. They come because theyâ€™ve heard about the shop dogs, or because someone told them years ago that bookstores were moving onto the endangered species list and they wanted to see one that was thriving in its natural habitat: in a strip mall, behind Foxâ€™s Donut Den, beside   Paint Store. Some come in hopes of seeing a favorite author read, or catching a glimpse of the author who   the store. That would be me. Karen Hayes and I opened Parnassus Books in November 2011. This summer, when Pickles and Ice Cream Maternity went out of business, we took down the adjoining wall and doubled our space. Business is good, which, by bookstore standards, means we spring for employee health insurance and pay the rent. Karen and I are vocal supporters of the Shop Local movement, while at the same time benefiting from the Destination Bookstore travelers. It seems as if every time Iâ€™m in the back room signing special orders or meeting with staffers to pick a book for our First Editions Club, Bill, the tall Englishman who works the front, comes to tell me a book club has just arrived from Omaha or Bangor or Sweden. I go out and pose for group pictures, recommend books, give an impromptu tour. I always ask the same question, â€œWhat made you think Iâ€™d be here?â€ because seriously, Iâ€™m gone a lot. They always give me the same answer: Iâ€™m not why they came. They came to see the store. With its high wooden shelves and rolling ladders and dangling stars, Parnassus is  â€”   if I may say so myself  â€”   worth a visit, a reminder that a strip mall need not be judged by its parking lot. But there are many bookstores that could stand as the centerpiece of a vacation. Here are some categories to consider when searching for one. Before we opened Parnassus, I made a   tour of American bookstores. The best advice I got was this: If you want customers, you have to raise them yourself. That means a strong childrenâ€™s section. If   have taken a bite out of the adult market, theyâ€™ve done very little damage to childrenâ€™s books, maybe because even the most   parents understand that reading â€œGoodnight Moonâ€ off your phone doesnâ€™t create the same occasion for bonding. There are some knockout stores that sell nothing but childrenâ€™s books, including the Curious George Store in Cambridge, Mass. Wild Rumpus in Minneapolis, Books of Wonder in New York, and Tree House Books in Ashland, Ore. as well as loads of general interest stores that do a particularly great job with their childrenâ€™s section, like Women  Children First in Chicago and Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn. For many of us, childrenâ€™s books are the foundation of bookselling, the cornerstone, the rock on which this church is built. Before going, be sure to check the bookstoresâ€™ events calendars for visiting authors. If I may make a sweeping generalization, childrenâ€™s book authors  â€”   from those who write board books suitable for teething to those who write young adult fiction full of vampires and angst  â€”   are the nicest people on the planet. Not only will they talk to your child or young adult, they will relate to them, they will draw pictures for them, they will create an indelible link between reading and joy. Iâ€™m not sure why youâ€™d be going to Greenwood, Miss. except for a mad desire to see TurnRow Book Company. Itâ€™s one of the most beautiful bookstores I know, and the sheer unlikelihood of its presence makes a traveler feel sheâ€™s stumbled into an oasis in the Mississippi Delta. Thanks to the Viking Range plant, the town also has a few   restaurants and a very pretty inn, but the bookstore is the reason to go. And since youâ€™re in Greenwood, youâ€™ve got to go to Oxford, a town defined by its writers. You can visit Faulknerâ€™s home as well as the bookstore, or make that bookstores. Richard Howorth, the former mayor of Oxford, has three locations on the downtown square: the original Square Books Square Books, Jr. the childrenâ€™s store and Off Square, which sells discount books and provides space for author events. Despite the enormousness of Ole Miss, these three stores are the backbone of Oxford. When was the last time you strolled around downtown Los Angeles near Skid Row? Never? Iâ€™m from Los Angeles and it took the Last Bookstore to get me there. The storeâ€™s tagline, â€œWhat are you waiting for? We wonâ€™t be here forever,â€ has a suitably apocalyptic ring to it, but the place is so monumental that itâ€™s hard to imagine it going anywhere: 22, 000 square feet on three floors with new and used books, vinyl records and gallery space. The whole thing appears to have been made out of books, books that are folded and fanned and stacked into towering sculptures. The clientele is as eclectic and fascinating as the reading selection. It did my heart good to see so many tattooed kids with black nail polish and nose rings sprawled out in chairs reading books. As long as youâ€™re going to places you never thought youâ€™d go, head to Plainville, Mass. to see An Unlikely Story Bookstore  CafÃ©, which I hope will soon replace Disney World as the place all parents feel   to take their children. Jeff Kinney took part of the proceeds from his juggernaut series â€œDiary of a Wimpy Kidâ€ and built his hometown a   bookstore  â€”   the ultimate fulfillment of literary civic duty. The building contains a dazzling bookshop, event space and cafe, and the top floor will soon be a Wimpy Kid museum, complete with movie props and the model for the Wimpy Kid Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day parade balloon. (How do you know that your character is reaching the heights of Snoopy? You get your own parade balloon.) Iâ€™m a sucker for a little bookstore. In the right hands, the limited space can set off an explosion of personality and innovation. Itâ€™s like going to a French bistro with five tables and five things on the menu: You discover theyâ€™re exactly the right five things. New York City, land of skyrocketing rents and ubiquitous nail salons, has some of the best tiny bookstores in the world, including the Corner Bookstore, 192 Books and my favorite, Three Lives  Company. Sometimes whatâ€™s lost in square footage is made up for by a brilliant staff, or maybe itâ€™s just that the people who work in tiny stores really do know exactly where every book is located. And theyâ€™ve read them. Little bookstores give off that same warm, snug feeling one gets from reading a novel in a comfy chair. Go look at the light in Newtonville Books outside Boston, or drive down the cape to Provincetown Bookshop, that essential last stop before hitting the beach. The novelist Louise Erdrich owns the tiny Birchbark Books in Minneapolis, a store that uses a chunk of its limited space to display an elaborately carved confessional box. Youâ€™ll wish every bookstore had one. In Washington you see the Vietnam Memorial, the new National Museum of African American History  Culture and Politics  Prose Bookstore. Itâ€™s where the Obamas shop, and itâ€™s where the movers and shakers of our nationâ€™s capital come to see whatâ€™s really going on. It also happens to be where I eat lunch, as they have the best bookstore cafe I know. Doesnâ€™t everyone who visits Harvard go across the street to the Harvard Book Store, a shop as esteemed as the university? When youâ€™re finished there (it will take all day) walk down Plympton Street to Grolier Poetry Book Shop. In Cambridge a store that sells nothing but poetry seems indispensable. But if youâ€™re interested in Grolierâ€™s aesthetic opposite, go to the fabulous Books  Books. Itâ€™s everything I love about Miami without any of the things I donâ€™t love about Miami, a store where books are elevated to new heights of gorgeousness. Just walking in the door of either the Coral Gables or South Beach location makes me feel like an automatic hipster, a book hipster. I always leave with armloads of art books and travel books, things I never knew I needed but I do need desperately. And then, of course, thereâ€™s Powellâ€™s: an entire block, a dizzying,   City of Books. The fact that Portland, Ore. celebrates being defined by its independent bookstore is really all you need to know about Portland. I went on my first book tour in 1992 when I was 28, and I have been going on book tours ever since. I have made it a point to go to bookstores in every town Iâ€™ve ever driven through. I go both as a writer and a reader, for business and for pleasure, and I have been in love with too many to make a comprehensive list here. Still, I have to call out some of my favorites, like Boswell Book Company in Milwaukee, lit by the internal fire of one Daniel Goldin, a stupendously great bookseller. And since youâ€™re in Milwaukee, you wonâ€™t be that far from McLean  Eakin Booksellers in Petoskey, Mich. a personal favorite that proves Northern Michigan has a lot more to offer than cherries and apples. Malapropâ€™s was the heart and soul of Asheville, N. C. when Asheville was a sleepy little hippie town, and itâ€™s still its heart and soul now that the city is cool and overcrowded, a position Malapropâ€™s maintained by being unabashedly true to itself. No bookstore ever made a strip mall look better than Book Passage in Corte Madera, Calif. Every author you could hope to see comes to read at Book Passage. And then thereâ€™s Explore Booksellers in Aspen, Colo. a town thatâ€™s gotten so expensive that the bookstore would have to sell Chanel bags alongside Michael Chabon novels in order to make the rent, so a group of people got together and bought it so that the town could have a bookstore All these bookstores will welcome you, as will those I failed to mention. Theyâ€™re delicate little ecosystems based on a passion for books and a belief in community. Theyâ€™re here for you, but they need your attention and support to thrive. Of course weâ€™d love to see you at Parnassus. The shop dogs are lazy. They pile up in the office and sleep beneath the desks, but if you ask, weâ€™ll wake them up and send them out on the floor. When youâ€™ve gotten your recommendations from our brilliant staff, and listened to story time in the childrenâ€™s section, and seen a couple of authors (and country music stars) shopping themselves, weâ€™ll give you advice on where to go to dinner and hear music. Or maybe you just want to sit in a quiet chair and read your new book. Go ahead, thatâ€™s what weâ€™re here for."
21170,"Law-Abiding but Illegal, and Fearing the New Trump Rules - The New York Times",Jim Dwyer,"Delfin Polanco waits on Thursday morning for a lawyer to help him stay in the country where he raised his son and has lived for 22 years. Like about 40 others, he arrived by 5 a. m. in Lower Manhattan for a legal clinic offered for immigrants by Catholic Charities. It will be hours before he is seen. To pass the time, Mr. Polanco thumbs through pictures on his phone and cards in his wallet. There he is outside the old Yankee Stadium in 2008, behind two men carrying championship trophies, part of the crew that was moving the team into its new home down the block. Here he is on the Teamsters union card that he got in 1999, which lets him work as a mover. And there is his medical card, listing him as a patient of a clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he goes for treatment of the breathing ailments that he got after working on the cleanup of the World Trade Center site. â€œLook,â€ Mr. Polanco says. â€œI had hair. â€ Now he is 47 and not much is left. Mr. Polanco moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1995 when he married an American citizen. Along the way, they divorced. â€œThey stamped â€˜deportâ€™ on my work paper seven years ago and tell me to come back every year for the inspection,â€ he said. More people live in New York City in 2017 than at any time in its history nearly half were born outside the United States. The cityâ€™s white population has declined by 3. 5 million since 1950. They have been replaced by immigrants. A tribe of people from all over the world saved the city by moving here and going to work. The Trump family made fortunes in New York, thanks to them. With or without permission to be in the country, immigrants drove pistons in the city and national economy  â€”   in the service industry, in agriculture, in universities and in   jobs. Inevitably, some large, uncountable number are here without permission. The enforcement of immigration laws depends on a catâ€™s cradle of rules and policies strung together by successive presidential administrations. Over time, the population of   people in the United States who do not have citizenship, working papers or other visas is thought to have grown to 11 million. Many national Republicans once advocated comprehensive immigration reform, but such views became heresy with the rise of the Tea Party after the 2008 financial crisis. The political stalemate meant the continued growth of a   system that allowed tacit acceptance of people who were   apart from their immigration status. Like, for instance, Mr. Polanco. This week, President Trumpâ€™s administration announced plans to enforce the laws aggressively by deporting people who are in the country illegally, regardless of their behavior. Those plans may be limited by the sheer logistics, and in public statements the administration has said it will use its resources to find and deport the most dangerous criminals, which was the practice of the Obama administration. Nevertheless, worries about expanded enforcement are driving throngs to clinics like the one held by Catholic Charities every Thursday in the financial district beginning at 8 a. m. according to Mario Russell, the director of immigrant and refugee services for the archdiocese. Many people were turned away, advised to call a hotline,   . The first people arrived at the clinic this week at 4:30 a. m. to make sure they could see one of the five lawyers and three counselors. Dionne Raymon, 42, a mother of three who was born in Jamaica and has been in the United States for 24 years, was there by 5. â€œLast week, I couldnâ€™t see anyone because I didnâ€™t get here until 8:30,â€ Ms. Raymon said. â€œI had to get the kids out to school. They are off this week. â€ Others spoke about boarding subways at 4 a. m. of getting waylaid in the unfamiliar canyons of Lower Manhattan on previous trips. Ms. Raymon said she had never had a minuteâ€™s trouble with the police. Studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States. â€œBut to live outside the law, you must be honest,â€ Bob Dylan wrote. â€œIâ€™ve never been to jail,â€ Mr. Polanco said. â€œTickets, nothing. â€ His son, born in the United States, is about to start college, but is still too young to â€œclaimâ€ his father under kinship citizenship eligibility. Mr. Polanco frets that returning to the Dominican Republic will put medical care for his lung problems beyond his means. â€œI came here, I was young,â€ Mr. Polanco said. â€œNow I am old. Old and sick. â€"
21171,Bernie Sanders Could Replace President Trump With Little-Known Loophole,nan,"Bernie Sanders Could Replace President Trump With Little-Known Loophole Read this article and then share with your friends. By Matt Masur / huffingtonpost.com 
Here is exactly what we need to do to save our great society. The information here is what weâ€™ve all been waiting for. By doing this we can make Bernie the president on Inauguration day rather than President-elect Donald Trump . 
Actually, no we canâ€™t. There is no loophole that allows a random person to assume the office of president. Thatâ€™s pretty basic common sense but yet you clicked or even shared this article anyway. Now that right there is the real point of this postâ€¦ 
Our social media sites have been flooded with misinformation in the past few months. While this has always been a problem, it now appears to have exploded over this election season. We are seeing post after post stating just plain illogical things and this is not a problem unique to any one side. 
Even more dangerous are the posts that donâ€™t appear to be far-fetched until you dig into the details. The big problem with thatâ€¦ People donâ€™t dig for the details. 
There will be many people who clicked share on this post because of its headline. They may not even click to open the story. They will never actually read these words. Ironically these are the folks who need to hear it the most. 
As John Oliver correctly pointed out Sunday night, folks are being fed what they want to hear and theyâ€™re eating it up like a starving person. The most important thing in a functional society is a well-informed public. What we have now is not only uninformed but misinformed masses. Thatâ€™s something that should scare us all. The most important thing in a functional society is a well-informed public. What we have now is not only uninformed but misinformed masses. 
How do we combat this problem? Easy, we have to do some work. While I could give a long dissertation on what exactly that means, no one has the patience to read it all, so here are five quick steps thatâ€™ll fit in a memeâ€¦ 
1. Read first. Then share. I myself am guilty of basing comments or even clicking share based on the headline. This is the worst thing any of us could do. Stop being lazy. 
2. Check the source (and their sources). In the age of new media true and valid information comes from non-traditional sources but so does a lot of garbage. Any article that posts facts, figures or quotes should provide a source for that information. If there is no backup for their claims, move on. 
3. Watch out for recycled stories. One thing that seems to be feeding into the misinformation problem is when old stories are being presented as happening now. Check the date on the story before you read on. Youâ€™ll be shocked to see how many are from another time and arenâ€™t applicable to the current event you thought they were talking about. 
4. If you care about facts, ignore the blatantly slanted. Having a slant or taking a position on a story is not wrong in itself. What is wrong is when these ideas are taken as unbiased fact. You can avoid all of this by simply avoiding those sites to start with. Any website with the words: Conservative, Liberal, Democrat, Republican, etc. in the title are just advertising how slanted they are. Thatâ€™s ok if you choose to live in your sideâ€™s bubble but please donâ€™t have any delusions that these stories reflect the whole picture. 
5. Google it. God (and Sergey ) gave us Google for a reason. If you see a story thatâ€™s unbelievable or has no sources or even if it does, verify. See if the same facts are reported across multiple outlets. See if anyone disputes these facts. Read these pieces and then make up your mind. 
If we could all take these simple steps our society would be a better place. We all have opinions and leanings. There is nothing wrong with that but could we at least all come from a starting point based on facts and reality? 
The truth is, sharing illogical things begins to erode YOUR credibility and it makes you look foolish. Trust me, I speak from experience. 
Now go share this, please. 0.0 Â·"

[The university, already embroiled in a free speech controversy, reportedly plans to offer a   course inspired by the fictional Dothraki and High Valyrian languages used by characters on the HBO series Game of Thrones.   David J. Peterson, who was hired to create the showâ€™s languages, will teach the course titled â€œThe Linguistics of Game of Thrones and the Art of Language Invention. â€ Peterson told Berkeley News that the Game of Thrones world created by author George R. R. Martin â€œwill serve as a kind of framing device for the course so students can focus on the linguistic details of their creations, not the fictional side. â€ Peterson will teach the     course, which is being offered during the May 22 to June 30 summer session. No stranger to the Hollywood language scene, Peterson has helped develop languages for such shows as the Syfy channelâ€™s Defiance series, Marvelâ€™s Thor, and NBCâ€™s Emerald City. The UC Berkeley fight song â€œSons of Californiaâ€ has already been remixed in the Dothraki language.  The Game of Thrones language course announcement comes on the heels of conservative commentator Ann Coulterâ€™s decision to cancel her speech at UC Berkley, after law enforcement sources told Fox News that there was a â€œ99% chanceâ€ of violent attacks on campus by   activists if the speech went ahead. The university had initially canceled Coulterâ€™s speech and then rescheduled it for a week later, when the majority of its students did not have class. The two student groups who invited Coulter filed a lawsuit against the school on Monday, alleging its initial cancelation of the event was discriminatory and a violation of First Amendment rights. The seventh season of Game of Thrones returns to HBO on July 16.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson"

21174,Gamechanger: Russia successfully tests its first-ever hypersonic weapon,Ian Greenhalgh,"Time for FBI director Comey to go â€¹ â€º Ian Greenhalgh is a photographer and historian with a particular interest in military history and the real causes of conflicts. His studies in history and background in the media industry have given him a keen insight into the use of mass media as a creator of conflict in the modern world. His favored areas of study include state sponsored terrorism, media manufactured reality and the role of intelligence services in manipulation of populations and the perception of events. Gamechanger: Russia successfully tests its first-ever hypersonic weapon By Ian Greenhalgh on October 30, 2016 Russia successfully tests its first-ever hypersonic weapon 
The hypersonic aircraft, known as â€œarticle 4202â€ or â€œ15U71â€ was successfully tested on October 25 for the first time. All avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system of the vehicle are entirely of Russian production. 
The weapon is capable of speeding up to 15 Max, or 7 km/sec. The vehicle was designed to be installed at prospective intercontinental ballistic missiles, instead of conventional warheads. The â€œ4202â€ vehicle starts working at an altitude of about 100 km and flies to the target at the speed of 5-7 km/s. Before entering dense layers of the atmosphere, directly above the target, the hypersonic aircraft performs a complex maneuver that makes it difficult to interception by missile defense systems of the enemy. 
Noteworthy, the project of hypersonic warheads called â€œAlbatrossâ€ appeared in the USSR in the mid-1980s, as a response to USAâ€™s attempts to create a missile defense system within the concept of â€œstar wars.â€ However, due to the technical difficulties, the project was shut down. In the mid-1990s, the Scientific and Production Association (NPO) resumed the development of the new weapon under the number â€œ4202.â€ 
According to sources at Roscosmos state corporation, the successful tests of the new hypersonic aircraft were made possible with the help of the intensive import substitution program. For instance, Russian engineers had to get rid of the control system, previously manufactured by Ukrainian company Hartron. The successfully implemented program provided an opportunity to resume the tests. As a result, all the avionics and electronic systems, as well as the control system now completely consist of Russian components. 
The Russian Army is to receive new hypersonic weapons by 2020. The development of high-speed anti-aircraft missiles has made it possible to intercept and destroy any modern aircraft or missile at any altitude. The way out is to create the aircraft capable of flying faster than interceptor missiles. 
For this particular reason, major powers of the world, such as the USA, Russia and China, rushed to develop hypersonic flight vehicles of different types and purposes. 
China, for example, tested the hypersonic WU-14 glider on 9 January 2015. The Chinese aircraft is launched into outer space with the help of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Then, the vehicle develops the speed of 10M, that is, more than 12,300 km/h, and dives onto the target. State-of-the-art air defense systems are unable to detect and intercept a target flying at this speed. 
China has thus become the third country in the world, after Russia and the United States, which has the technology of hypersonic vehicles for both nuclear and conventional weapons. In fact, the Chinese have created a warhead with control surfaces that can maneuver in flight thus becoming practically invulnerable. However, this vehicle does not have its own engine, so the Chinese creation has become another weapon for â€œthe poorest.â€ 
Russia currently works on different types of hypersonic scramjet missiles, which can be launched from land, ships or aircraft. 
Pravda.Ru requested an expert opinion from chief editor of â€œArms Exportâ€ magazine, Andrey Frolov. 
â€œHow competitive is Russia in the development of hypersonic aircraft?â€ 
â€œRussia is at the forefront. This is not the first test, I think that in the near future these systems will be passed into service at the army. The Americans do not have such weapons yet, the Chinese are in the development process.â€ 
â€œAre there any other details available?â€ 
â€œThis is a secret subject. We know that such weapons have been created â€“ and this is a lot to know already.â€ Related Posts: No Related Posts The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

21175,Susie Breitbart Gives Rare Interview: Andrew Was â€™Good Friend to So Many People Who Disagreed with Himâ€™ - Breitbart,John Hayward,"Susie Breitbart, the widow of Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart, talked to Greg Gutfeld of Fox News on â€œThe One with Greg Gutfeldâ€ about her husbandâ€™s storied career in an interview last week. [Gutfeld began with a story of his own: how he met first met Andrew Breitbart while writing for the Huffington Post, which Andrew helped launch and edit. It was when Andrew encouraged Gutfeld to follow his own instincts (as opposed to micromanaging his talent) that the Fox News personality realized that Breitbart had â€œmajor balls. â€  â€œI remember that, and I remember hearing about you long before I met you because he was fascinated with what you were doing, and what you were writing,â€ Susie Breitbart said with a chuckle. â€œHe loved your style, he loved your humor and your insight. He was, I think at that time, also really trying to own who he was, and become his own person, and no longer be in the shadows of people like Matt Drudge and Arianna Huffington. â€  â€œThe way you described him saying â€˜Can you change that?â€™ and then calling you back and saying â€˜no, wait, keep it the way it is,â€™ I think that was him sort of coming into his own at the same time and going, â€˜Letâ€™s own this, letâ€™s be who we are,â€™â€ she told Gutfeld. Gutfeld credited Andrew Breitbart with writing half of his best jokes. â€œI would send a piece that would be like, letâ€™s say 1500 words. It would come back 3000 words because he added so many jokes, and some of them were so absurd and surreal and like from another planet that it would take a while to understand what he was doing. Then I would edit it out and I would go, â€˜No, wait, I canâ€™t edit this out, itâ€™s too good!â€ Gutfeld reminisced. â€œHe used to call those your double secret blog posts,â€ Susie Breitbart said. â€œYou were kind of sneaking in through a back door of the Huffington Post and writing things you werenâ€™t really supposed to. â€ Gutfeld compared the â€œunusual group of friendsâ€ around Andrew and Susie to the eclectic cast of a â€œ1970s talk show. â€ â€œThat was a really interesting group,â€ Susie agreed. â€œI canâ€™t remember who initially formed that group. I want to say I think it was Dale Launer, a screenwriter. He wrote My Cousin Vinny, among other things. That group was just an eclectic group of writers and journalists, and not necessarily politically   people. Andrew was always just fascinated with storytellers, loved being around all types of people. â€ Gutfeld recalled his surprise at learning Susieâ€™s father is prolific actor Orson Bean, â€œwho was for me kind of a Sixties and Seventies legend because he was on everything. â€ â€œHe was!â€ she agreed. â€œTo some people my dad was a household name, and some people had never heard of him. Heâ€™s so many things to so many different people, because he has done so much. Heâ€™s a raconteur, most notably. He hosted The Tonight Show over a hundred times when Johnny Carson was absent, or he was a guest on The Tonight Show within those appearances. Heâ€™s been on Broadway, television, movies. He often gets recognized, and it kind of spans across various generations. â€ â€œWhen we were growing up, game shows were huge, and theyâ€™re making a comeback, a lot of them,â€ she said, remembering her fatherâ€™s many appearances on classic shows. â€œThe Match Game, Tattletales  â€”   which he did with my mom, Caroline, which was like a couplesâ€™ game show. He did To Tell the Truth, and I think Hollywood Squares, all of those were a huge part of my growing up too. â€ Gutfeld recalled visiting Orson Beanâ€™s house and discovering he kept a news clipping about the   terror attack pinned to his refrigerator door, because he said it was something that should be remembered every day. Susie Bean Breitbart said she believes the clipping holds that position on her fatherâ€™s refrigerator to this very day. She hastened to add that her father is hardly a brooding man. â€œHe just finished doing a   show about his life. His life was very heavy and tragic as a child. Throughout the show, he would tell some really, really tragic story  â€”   and then follow it up immediately with a magic trick and a joke, to sort of lighten the mood,â€ she said. â€œYou can watch his   show, itâ€™s on YouTube. Thatâ€™s his style. â€ Susie said she was never a political person herself, although her father and later her husband became major political presences. â€œI always had my opinions, of course, but I was a registered independent from the first time I was old enough to vote. The first time I did vote was for H. Ross Perot, because Andrew and I were just kind of fascinated, and amused, and just trying to figure it all out,â€ she recalled. â€œAt that time Andrew was becoming increasingly obsessed with the Clarence Thomas hearings, and politics became more prominent in his life. He became more interested in all of that,â€ she said.  â€œI was never political in the way he was. He started to be aware of the effect it was having. He would think, â€˜Susie never signed up for this,â€™ because as he became more of a public figure people would approach us and say things at dinner parties, and at schools. Itâ€™s not something I had really been prepared for,â€ said Susie Breitbart.  â€œI think I always knew that Andrew was going to make a name for himself. When we met and started dating, he was a waiter. I looked at him and I said, â€˜This guyâ€™s going to do something.â€™ He wanted to be a comedy writer, so I figured it was going to be that. He always was very funny. I never figured it would be this, but actually it doesnâ€™t surprise me. It was only a matter of, â€˜Whatâ€™s he going to do next? Whatâ€™s he going to be?â€™ Because it was going to be something,â€ she said. Gutfeld recalled that politics was almost never the topic of discussion when he hung around with the   Andrew Breitbart. â€œHe wasnâ€™t angry,â€ he said. â€œI remember we all went on the National Review cruise together, and you and Andrew were both panelists, but other than the work you were doing there and the reason we were there, it was really just a vacation with friends. He was a lighthearted person. He could talk to anyone about anything. It didnâ€™t have to be politics,â€ she said.  â€œAt some point that became difficult to navigate sometimes. I came home to our first apartment, when we first started dating, to find Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses trying to get out, because they were literally trapped in there. He was so fascinated with exploring people, and stories, and ideas. He could talk to anyone about anything, and he knew something about everything,â€ she said. Of course, politics came to dominate Andrew Breitbartâ€™s later career, becoming â€œthe reason people wanted to talk to him in some instances. â€ Gutfeld remembered Andrewâ€™s particularly strong feelings about 80s New Wave music. â€œHe had this Friday night Twitter DJ thing that he would do with 80s music,â€ Susie said. â€œIâ€™m still not on Twitter, so I wasnâ€™t able to really follow it when it was happening, but he loved it. He was obsessed with New Wave, British pop. â€ Gutfeld asked for Susieâ€™s take on the most   facet of Andrewâ€™s personality. â€œI think because he considered himself to be somewhat of a warrior, people assume that he was an instigator,â€ she observed. â€œHe really wasnâ€™t a  . He liked people to a fault. It was pretty easy to ingratiate yourself to Andrew. He was someone who felt that he needed to stand up for what was right, and stand up to bullies. There was this very intense   side of him, but the side that people didnâ€™t really get to see when he became more of a public figure was that he was such a lighthearted, funny, crazy, smart, sensitive guy. â€ â€œThere is some of that out there,â€ she added. â€œHe went on your show Red Eye, and I think tweaked his nipples after snorting a powdered form of red wine or something. â€  â€œThatâ€™s true!â€ Gutfeld laughed.  â€œThatâ€™s out there, but I donâ€™t think most people are Googling â€˜Breitbartâ€™ along with the terms â€˜goofy, lighthearted, silly.â€™ Theyâ€™re more Googling â€˜controversy, Trump,â€™ you know,â€ said Susie. Gutfeld recalled how Andrew was once thrown off his game before a Red Eye appearance because he was worried his daughter was mad at him for leaving a slumber party early. â€œThat was a bigger deal to him than anything,â€ Gutfeld said. â€œAnd he always used to say that he was so lucky he was married to you. He would say to me, â€˜I canâ€™t believe she married me.â€™ Because we would sit and commiserate over stuff, and he would say that. He would just laugh and go, â€˜How did I get this lucky? â€™â€ Gutfeld laughed as he recalled the great downside to Andrewâ€™s easy affection for people: â€œHe would introduce you to somebody that is not a good person, but he was so forgiving  â€¦     he took in stray dogs, you know what I mean?â€ â€œHe did,â€ Susie agreed. â€œMy dad always says about his wife Alley when heâ€™s ready to leave a party, he says, â€˜She has a character flaw: She likes people.â€™ Andrew and I had to develop a kind of shorthand at some point that meant  â€”   me looking at him which said, â€˜I love you, but Iâ€™m ready to go home. Iâ€™ll be taking the car, and you can take a taxi in three hours when youâ€™re done talking to this guy. â€™â€ â€œAnd sometimes that guy would come home with him, and he would stay at our house for a weekend,â€ she added. â€œIâ€™m not kidding. He would bring people home, and just the way he opens my dadâ€™s guest house to you  â€¦    â€ â€œYes! I was one of those stray dogs!â€ Gutfeld cried. â€œSometimes we got lucky and the stray dog was Greg Gutfeld. Sometimes it wasnâ€™t so lucky,â€ said Susie. â€œHe was really interested in just exploring peopleâ€™s character and personalities. Sometimes he would delve in without really vetting the situation, I would say. He was a nice person, too. He didnâ€™t want to turn people away, I suppose,â€ she said. Susie Breitbart said writing has been part of her healing process. â€œInitially I started writing for my kids, because I want them to remember who he was as a person. Itâ€™s so easy, I think of my own childhood so I can conjure up stories when Iâ€™m asked, like what was it like growing up with my dad, or whatever,â€ she recalled.  â€œReally I feel like most of the time Iâ€™m just culling through like a shoebox full of Polaroid pictures, and I have to really make myself remember. So I want to put down these stories on paper for my kids, and I want to collect stories from other people who had personal interactions with Andrew, because I donâ€™t want them to just see the biased tidbits that are out there on the Internet, that really only capture his persona,â€ she said.  â€œThey donâ€™t necessarily capture who he was, this whole other side of him,â€ she maintained. â€œHe was this intense, and thoughtful, and intelligent person  â€”   but he was also, like you said, a goofball. I think you referred to him recently as just a big hairy dad. And he was that! He was so many things. He was such a good friend to so many people, and so many people who disagreed with him. He was all of those things. I want them to remember that. â€"
21176,Canada and EU sign â€˜thoroughly undemocraticâ€™ CETA trade deal,Nadia Prupis,"Canada and EU sign â€˜thoroughly undemocraticâ€™ CETA trade deal Opposition groups note that the deal could still fail legal scrutiny and ratification in Europe By Nadia Prupis 
Canada and the European Union signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on Sunday amid widespread protests against the controversial deal that came back to life after negotiations stalled over objections from Wallonia, Belgium. 
Environmental and democracy groups who opposed the agreement issued cautious statements condemning the signing but noting that CETA was not a done deal. 
â€œThis agreement will probably not survive the democratic and legal scrutiny of the ratification process over the coming months. Itâ€™s time for our governments to break rank with corporate lobbyists and redesign a trade policy that respects democracy and promotes the public interest,â€ said Shira Stanton, trade policy adviser at Greenpeace EU. 
CETA now faces a vote in the European Parliament and ratification by the parliaments of the EUâ€™s 28 countries. 
If it passes, CETA would create a legal system that allows corporations to sue governments for perceived loss of profit. That framework will also be put to scrutiny by the European Court of Justice and the German constitutional court, and if it fails to stand up would invalidate CETA. 
The deal has long been opposed on the grounds that it would harm human rights, democracy, and the climate, among other risks. 
Alfred de Zayas, the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, said in a statement Saturday that each country should hold a referendum on signing the deal before doing so, warning that it was a â€œcorporate-driven, fundamentally flawed treaty.â€ 
â€œThere is a legitimate fear that CETA will dilute environmental standards, food security, and health and labor protection,â€ he said. â€œA treaty that strengthens the position of investors, transnational corporations, and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats.â€ 
Global Justice Now (GJN) trade and migration campaigner Guido Tallman tweeted a picture of the massive deal and wrote, â€œHereâ€™s CETA. Any MEP planning to vote for it, should be sure to read it first. All of it. So they know what theyâ€™re voting for.â€ 
Throughout Europe this weekend, CETA opponents took to the streets to protest the signing. In London on Saturday, many posed outside the European Commission office dressed as zombies to symbolize CETAâ€™s seeming resurrection, urging commissioners to â€œstop CETA rising from the dead.â€ 
In Brussels, some protesters broke through a barricade and attempted to storm the European Commission building before being dragged away by police. 
GJN executive director Nick Dearden said Saturday , â€œThe signing ceremony . . . means that CETA has been brought back from the dead for nowâ€”but it is a ticking time bomb. The Wallonia parliament has a promise that they will be able to stop the ratification of CETA when they get a formal vote on it, and unless there are substantial changes, theyâ€”and hopefully other parliamentsâ€”will use that veto.â€ 
â€œCETA would open up our government to a deluge of court cases by North American multinational corporations and investors,â€ Dearden continued. â€œIt presents a threat to our ability to protect the environment, to protect the public and to limit the power of big banks. Itâ€™s thoroughly undemocratic and must be stopped.â€

21177,The Toronto Star Published An â€˜Unauthorized Databaseâ€™ Of Things That Will INFURIATE Trump | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave,nan,"on November 6, 2016 3:40 pm Â· 
Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnâ€™t hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star â€˜s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trumpâ€™s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . 
There are literally hundreds of lies in Trumpâ€™s speeches. Theyâ€™re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. 
Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, sheâ€™s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. 
The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clintonâ€™s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clintonâ€™s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintonsâ€™ corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trumpâ€™s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obamaâ€™s record, The campaign, Russia, Trumpâ€™s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clintonâ€™s health and Government corruption. 
They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, â€œThe electoral system is rigged.â€ Of course, itâ€™s rigged against him: 
â€œAfter plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. â€˜Riggedâ€™ became his catchword. 
He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired â€˜thugsâ€™ to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis â€” cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. 
In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they donâ€™t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.â€ 
Nobodyâ€™s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. 
Another is, â€œMuslims are risky.â€ This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: 
â€œHis claims that Syrian refugees â€” 99 per cent are Muslim â€” are terrorists plays to the fears of the â€œother,â€ even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trumpâ€™s claims â€” about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.â€ 
â€œThe polls favour Trump.â€ Har de har har â€“ Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and theyâ€™re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: 
â€œIt seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This â€˜poll denialismâ€™ gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. 
His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling â€” and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. 
On Oct. 24, he said â€˜I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.â€™ In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. 
Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote â€” and exaggerate â€” those numbers.â€ 
But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, â€œThe failing NYTimes reporters donâ€™t even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!â€ Falsely said, â€œBy â€˜open borders,â€™ [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.â€ Falsely said, â€œHillaryâ€™s plan includes an open border with the Middle East.â€ Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, â€œa Democrat.â€ Falsely said, â€œWow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.â€ Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran â€œ$150 billionâ€ as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, â€œIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many peopleâ€¦Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.â€ Falsely asserted that Clinton has â€œbeen fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.â€ Falsely said, â€œAll together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.â€ Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO â€œobsolete because it doesnâ€™t cover terror;â€ falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didnâ€™t release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him â€œhave been largely debunked.â€ Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, â€œThe one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.â€ Falsely said â€œI did not. I did notâ€ to Clintonâ€™s charge that he thinks Climate change is a â€œhoax perpetrated by the Chinese.â€ Falsely said, â€œI was against going into Iraq. And itâ€™s so well-documented.â€ Falsely said, â€œOur taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.â€ 
And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, heâ€™ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paperâ€™s lying, and continue to sell the myth that heâ€™s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

21178,"Duterte, Mosul, Calais Jungle: Your Thursday Briefing - The New York Times",Charles McDermid,"Good morning.  Weâ€™re trying something new for our readers in Asia and Australia: a morning briefing to   your day.  What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Hereâ€™s what you need to know: â€¢ The contentious American presidential race is fracturing the Republican Party. Donald J. Trump and his allies are turning on Republican leaders in Congress with an intensity that sometimes matches their battle against Hillary Clinton. The latest hacked emails from WikiLeaks reveal worries about Clinton Foundation donations hurting Mrs. Clintonâ€™s political future. (The Clinton and Trump foundations are vastly different.) Mr. Trump has begun engaging in barely veiled promotions of his business brand, pulling reporters to his marquee properties between his campaign events. On Wednesday, he held a   at his   hotel near the White House. And Mr. Trump inaugurated a   talk show that is helping stoke speculation that he is planning to start his own network after the election. â€¢ President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines used his state visit to Japan to ratchet up his   remarks. â€œI want them out,â€ Mr. Duterte said of the United States troops in his country, adding that he was willing to â€œrevise or abrogate agreementsâ€ on military bases. But deep cultural, economic and military ties make upending the alliance unlikely. â€¢ Russia abruptly withdrew its application to dock three warships for refueling at a Spanish port in the Mediterranean, after NATO members urged Spain to turn the vessels away. The ships are en route to support Russian military operations in Syria. â€¢ The Islamic State is under siege in Syria and Iraq, but its influence is still felt around the world. Fighters linked to the terror group seized a port town in Somalia, and a group of gunmen who claimed allegiance to the group executed 23 civilian hostages in western Afghanistan. â€¢ â€œIncredibly lucky. â€ That was our photographer, who was covering Iraqi forcesâ€™ push toward Mosul when his convoy was hit by a suicide car bomb. This is his account, with photos and videos.  â€¢ Australia will suffer from drought, more extremely hot days and a longer and fiercer fire season, the countyâ€™s top weather scientists say. The report offers a snapshot to countries around the world of the challenges of climate change. â€¢ ZTO Express, the Chinese delivery service, is coming to Wall Street in what many expect to be the biggest initial public offering of the year. ZTOâ€™s top customer is the   giant Alibaba. â€¢ Samsung Electronicsâ€™ Galaxy Note 7 debacle virtually wiped out   profit at its mobile division. The company said it expected the division to recover in the coming quarter. â€¢ Recalled Takata airbags are still circulating freely in used cars in the United States, especially at auctions, the   rung of the market. â€¢ A glut of cash in Europe and Asia that is being pumped into the U. S. bond market has many economists warning of a looming crisis. They say the situation echoes a wave of investment in the years before last decadeâ€™s financial meltdown. â€¢ U. S. markets were lower, led by real estate shares. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of global markets. â€¢ China is holding military drills in an area of the South China Sea today and has ordered all other shipping to avoid the zone. [Reuters] â€¢ Dreamworld, the Australian theme park, said it would reopen this week with a â€œMemorial Dayâ€ for the four adults who were killed on a ride. [BBC] â€¢ The Afghan woman whose photograph as a young refugee was published on the cover of National Geographic in 1985 was arrested in Pakistan for trying to obtain illegal identity cards. [The New York Times] â€¢ Hong Kongâ€™s legislative council was thrown into chaos and adjourned again as two barred lawmakers stormed into the chamber with supporters. [South China Morning Post] â€¢ China instituted the   policy on this day in 1982 and suspended it a year ago. A new study in a British medical journal predicts no baby boom and a peak population of 1. 45 billion in 2029. [CCTV] â€¢ Five officials with the environmental protection agency in Xian, China, have been detained for tampering with   devices and falsifying data. [The Straits Times] â€¢ Mount Fuji tied a record for the latest date it has ever been capped by snow. Japan began keeping track of the event in 1894 the record was set in 1956. [Asahi Shimbun] â€¢ AIDS arrived in the U. S. long before â€œPatient Zero. â€ [The New York Times] â€¢ Relocating the 6, 000 or more people who had been living in â€œThe Jungleâ€ encampment in Calais has exposed Franceâ€™s divided view of migrants. [The New York Times] â€¢ The original set of 176 emojis, created by the Japanese mobile provider NTT DoCoMo and released in 1999, is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. â€¢ Weâ€™ve all lied once or twice to spare someoneâ€™s feelings, but a new study looks at how fibbing could turn into serial dishonesty. â€¢ The surfing world knew John John Florence was the best. Now itâ€™s official. How much is a ratâ€™s life worth? The universally loathed rodent is a frequent target of eradication programs in cities worldwide. Jakarta is the latest metropolis attempting to eliminate the urban pest to prevent outbreaks of diseases. Officials say they will offer a bounty of about $1. 50 a rat. Thatâ€™s a bump from Parisâ€™s offer of a nickel in 1920 (about 60 cents today) during its war on the animal. The Times reported then about a hunter using explosives who handed in about 250 tails. But it was a hoax. The police learned they were made of string and rubber. About 20 years later, the going rate for rat was just 2 cents in Chongqing, China. Humans were enlisted to help after it was said the rodents used their whiskers to poison the dogs sent to exterminate them. There are twists on the financial incentives to wipe out invasive species. Fishermen in Jamaica have reaped the benefits of a demand for lionfish on dinner plates. And prize money is offered in a Florida contest aimed at culling the stateâ€™s Burmese python population. Contestants there are allowed to use guns, but thatâ€™s something Jakartaâ€™s deputy governor hopes to avoid. â€œIf you miss your shot,â€ he warned, â€œthe bullets could hit other people. â€ Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.

21179,Omar Abdel Rahmanâ€™s Death Stirs Memories of 1993 Attack - The New York Times,Sarah Maslin Nir and Nikita Stewart,"It was a stunning act of terror, an assault on the World Trade Center that shook New York City. The long wake of its memory still slices through those who were there and the families of those who died. That was 1993. Roughly eight years before the twin towers were destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks, the buildings were badly damaged on a snowy afternoon by a truck bomb in a basement garage that killed six people. On Saturday, Omar Abdel Rahman  â€”   a blind cleric whose fiery speech exhorted   violence and galvanized those who executed the attack, according to prosecutors  â€”   died at 78 in a federal prison in North Carolina. He was serving a life sentence for plotting a series of assaults never carried out: bombs to be set in tunnels and buildings in an attack designed to bring New York to its knees. In the city, news of his death, from complications of diabetes and coronary artery disease, has caused many who experienced the bombing, whether as rescuers, government officials or witnesses, to recall the smoke and the gaping crater. They have also been led to consider something more existential: a February afternoon when, in an instant, the city experienced a sensation now all too familiar but then quite new  â€”   vulnerability. â€œThose who went through the â€™93 experience remember it as the beginning of the loss of innocence,â€ said Anthony E. Shorris, then the first deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. After the blast, Mr. Shorris spent a month inside the   crater in the garage beneath the World Trade Center plaza as teams shored it up and the police dug for bodies. â€œRemembering a time when we didnâ€™t think things like this could happen, and now we think about it all the time,â€ Mr. Shorris, now the deputy mayor of New York City, said. He paused. â€œAll the time. â€ The explosion, on Feb. 26, 1993, injured about 1, 000 people and could be heard on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The percussion was felt, some said, even farther north than Harlem. But New Yorkers thought of vehicle bombings as something that happened elsewhere. At first, the city sought more innocent explanations. Stanley Brezenoff, then the executive director of the Port Authority, which owned the World Trade Center property and had offices on the 65th floor, said: â€œPeople walked out of their offices and looked at each other. â€˜Did something happen? Did a generator go out? Was there some kind of a storm that we werenâ€™t aware of? â€™â€ He made the call to evacuate, and staff members carried a colleague in a wheelchair down more than 20 flights. â€œI donâ€™t think we stopped to reflect on the enormity of what happened,â€ said Mr. Brezenoff, now the interim head of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. The Port Authority launched an   effort to repair the stricken tower, reopening it in a month. â€œA lot of the response was, â€˜They canâ€™t do that to us,â€™â€ Mr. Brezenoff said. â€œIt sounds almost quaint now. â€ Raymond W. Kelly, who was then at the start of the first of his two stints as police commissioner, said, â€œIn terms of modern terrorism, the threat was there, but I donâ€™t think it was seen as a threat to this country. â€ The sense was, he said, â€œit was going on in other places. â€ It took about a day to definitively determine the blast was terrorism, and even then, the city was unsure who its enemies were, Mr. Kelly said. Speculation about their origin included the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East. The office of the governor at the time, Mario M. Cuomo, was on the 57th floor of 2 World Trade Center. After the boom, no one there panicked, mostly because it â€œnever occurred to us that it would be a bomb,â€ said Deborah Sale, who was chief of staff to Stan Lundine, then the lieutenant governor. Using their limited knowledge from infrequent fire drills and holding on to handrails, employees gingerly crept down the stairs, Ms. Sale said. â€œThere was no power at all, and it was pitch black,â€ she said, recalling that she had used a scarf to cover her nose and mouth in the smoky stairwell. The new reality of terrorism led to changes in the towers themselves. Afterward, emergency lights were installed, and screenings were added for people entering the building. Norman Steisel, who was first deputy mayor at the time, said the safety improvements saved lives on Sept. 11. â€œThose buildings were evacuated pretty quickly,â€ he said, referring to the floors below where the planes had hit. â€œJust imagine if more and more people were trapped downstairs. â€ In 1995, Mr. Abdel Rahman was convicted, along with nine others, on charges of seditious conspiracy in Federal District Court in Manhattan for a plot to bomb landmarks and infrastructure hubs, although the plans were never carried out. While prosecutors asserted he had been involved in the 1993 attack, six other men  were convicted after the vehicle identification number from a rental van linked to the perpetrators was found in the rubble. Mr. Kelly said he believed the conspiratorsâ€™ web of connections to groups like Al Qaeda had not been fully mined, even though data was discovered linking some to a somewhat obscure leader. His name was Osama bin Laden. â€œIt should have been a huge   call for the federal government and the city, and it wasnâ€™t,â€ he said. â€œAnd we paid the price on Sept. 11. â€ Although Mr. Abdel Rahmanâ€™s name has over time become linked in many minds to the 1993 attack, it has not for Lynne F. Stewart, his defense lawyer in his 1995 trial. She believes he is innocent. Ms. Stewart was convicted in 2005 of smuggling messages on behalf of the imprisoned sheikh and sentenced to a decade in prison, which she began serving about seven years ago. She was released in 2014 when a judge reduced her sentence after a diagnosis of terminal cancer. Speaking from her hospital bed in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan a few days after the sheikhâ€™s death, Ms. Stewart expressed the view that Mr. Abdel Rahmanâ€™s fiery rhetoric was a matter of free speech, a belief shared by many in the Arab world. â€œWe can name a lot of names in American history where people were convicted of not doing anything, and he is just the latest in a long line of American heroes who were convicted wrongfully,â€ she said."
21180,For Sale: CondÃ© Nast Treasures - The New York Times,Laura M. Holson,"CondÃ© Nast Publications might be sitting on a gold mine: its archive of some eight million photographs and illustrations from Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Vogue, Architectural Digest and other magazines. Now, given the tenuous state of the media industry, the company has plans to exploit it. The archive is housed on the 15th floor of a building not far from CondÃ© Nastâ€™s headquarters at One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Photographs and magazines, some going back more than 100 years, are stored in plastic slips and stacked in folders or tucked away in cabinets. Down the hall from the main room is a   locker, where original slides and transparencies are cataloged out of harmâ€™s way. Here you will find the first cover of Vogue, from Dec. 17, 1892, a sketch of a debutante clad in a ball gown and floating on what appears to be a cloud pillow. And here is a photograph of Coco Chanel lounging on a sofa, taken by the Vogue photographer Horst P. Horst, who died in 1999. Binders stand on metal shelves, packed with transparencies from   runway shows in New York and Paris, a chronicle of shifting necklines, hems and bejeweled bodices. â€œThis is the history of fashion,â€ said Ivan Shaw, 48, the former executive photo director of Vogue, who was named CondÃ© Nastâ€™s photography director for the archive in June. If all goes according to plan, much of this material will soon be the stuff of   prints,      coffee mugs, tote bags, pillows and such. Further, the company will invite the   known as influencers to explore the archive  â€”   videographers in tow  â€”   to discuss their favorite pieces and grab the interest of their   audiences. Mr. Shaw is part of a team charged with expanding sales of the archival goods. Since his appointment, as a major part of the initiative, he has been readying an online store, to be called CondÃ© Nast Editions. Until recently, the archive teamâ€™s priority was preservation. But given the industrywide losses in print advertising, CondÃ© Nast and other media companies are turning to new sources of revenue. â€œThese images have unprecedented value,â€ said Cathy Hoffman Glosser, who was hired as the companyâ€™s senior vice president for licensing in 2015. â€œAnd we want these assets to become more accessible. â€ Mr. Shaw calls the trove a time machine. â€œThere is a story about every picture from an artist, what he or she has taken,â€ he said. He mentioned Edward Steichen, who worked for Vogue and Vanity Fair for 15 years beginning in the 1920s. â€œWhen Iâ€™m holding a photograph by Edward Steichen, for that moment, I am there. â€ One of the photographers whose work has gained new attention since the opening of the archive is Horst, a favorite of Mr. Shawâ€™s, whose Vogue career flourished under the editor Diana Vreeland in the 1960s. In October, CondÃ© Nast published a Horst volume, â€œAround That Time: Horst at Home in Vogue,â€ edited by Hamish Bowles. In addition to producing the book, Mr. Shaw curated exhibitions of Horstâ€™s work at SOCO Gallery in Charlotte, N. C. and Venus Over Los Angeles in California. Others of note whose work sits in the archive and may soon be available to the wider world include Arthur Elgort, Robert Frank, George   Herbert Matter, Helmut Newton, Irving Penn, John Rawlings and Bert Stern, and the illustrators Miguel Covarrubias and Bob Staake. CondÃ© Nast is not free to make commercial use of all its artistsâ€™ works, however Annie Leibovitz, who shoots for Vanity Fair and Vogue, owns the rights to her photographs. In a   of the archiveâ€™s appeal, Paddle8 recently offered three limited editions of The New Yorkerâ€™s May 2, 2016, â€œPurple Rainâ€ cover illustration, a tribute to Prince by the artist Bob Staake, for $2, 700 apiece. (One has sold thus far.) Buyers with lighter wallets paid $95 for prints of the same cover at The New Yorker online store (189 were sold, Mr. Shaw said) or $325 for a signed,   version of the magazine cover (fans bought 121 of those). Mr. Shaw said he had two exhibitions and book projects in development on 1970s fashion photography, drawing on Vogueâ€™s library, and a documentary in the works on Mr. Elgort, 76, the   Vogue photographer. Camilla Nickerson, a fashion editor at Vogue who worked with Mr. Shaw, said, â€œHe has had to deal with a lot personalities and egos and he is good at being able to cope with their enormous needs. â€ But Mr. Shaw seems most interested in the images themselves. While flipping through a 1957 copy of Architectural Digest, he lingered over a picture by Julius Shulman, whose photographs of Southern California architecture captured midcentury style. â€œYou really feel like what the room would be like,â€ Mr. Shaw said, gazing at a Shulman photograph of a chic living room. â€œItâ€™s not just a document. Look at the reproduction quality. I could look at these pictures all day long. â€"
21181,"Here, On The Other Side",Bill White,"Bill White November 10, 2016 Here, On The Other Side 
I donâ€™t know about you, but I feel like Iâ€™ve just stepped out of H. G. Wellsâ€™ famous time machine and Iâ€™m standing on the other side of a great gulf in time. 
After over a year of grueling, divisive political campaigning, Donald Trump has finally won the election to become the 45th president of these United States. 
If anything, this election has divided this country even more than the last eight years of Obamaâ€™s presidency. 
Democrats and Republicans have always been opposites, but since the makeup of these two parties has split along liberal/conservative lines, their opposition to one another has become even more obvious. No longer is it just that they support opposite sides of the same issue, now they donâ€™t even see it as the same issue. 
What I mean by this is well illustrated by the recent controversy over transgender bathroom rights . 
To liberals, the issue is fair treatment for what is clearly a minority group. They apparently canâ€™t even see that giving that fair treatment puts women and girls at risk. But to the conservatives, the issue is all about protecting those girls and women. If the transgenders feel slighted by that, sorry, but safety has to come before their feelings. 
So now we have a new president elect, who somehow has to unite this divided nation and govern for all. That will be a monumental task, even without Obama having spent the last eight years trying to create division along whatever lines he could. 
The question is, is Trump up to the challenge? For that matter, is anyone capable of uniting us once again? 
The White House? 
Of course, I have to say that winning the election doesnâ€™t guarantee much of anything, right now. While Trump is the president elect, Obama is still in office. With all the election fraud thatâ€™s been going on this election, I have to wonder if the Democrats have some plan to keep him out of office, even if they have to break the law to do so. 
George Soros, the Democrat sugar daddy and puppet master all but said that they do. In a televised interview, he said that Trump would win the popular election, but that Hillary would ultimately occupy the White House. How can that be? What did he mean by that remark? 
Until inauguration day in January, things are still at risk. The Democrats could try to raise legal issues, saying that the count was inaccurate, as they did in the 2000 presidential elections. This seems to have become standard policy for the Dems, who seem to think that thereâ€™s no way that they could lose an election. After all, theyâ€™re the â€œelect.â€ 
Thereâ€™s also the possibility of something happening with the Electoral College vote on December 19th, or for that matter, when they deliver their votes to the Senate President, Joe Biden on December 28th. 
There could even be problems when Congress meets to do their official count of the votes on January 6th. With all the election fraud thatâ€™s come to light in the primaries and general election, the possibility of fraud in the Electoral College canâ€™t be ignored. 
Then thereâ€™s Obama himself. Someone wrote an article about how Obama will stay in office, â€œimpeachingâ€ the citizens of the United States for not voting in Hillary Clinton. While Iâ€™m fairly sure that the article in question was a gag piece, it has made its way around social media a couple of times. 
But there is something that Obama could do, and Iâ€™ve written about it before. That is, he could declare martial law, suspending the Constitution. All he would need is a good enough excuse to pass scrutiny. 
That excuse could come from widespread violence or social unrest; and heâ€™s got the means to make that happen. The police in Los Angeles and other major cities are preparing for mass riots (which liberals call â€œdemonstrationsâ€) in the wake of the election. 
ISIS has also called for violence, specifically on election day. While I havenâ€™t heard any reports of terrorist incidents happening, thatâ€™s not to say that they still canâ€™t. They have already shown their ability to infiltrate the United States and their capability to operate here. The big question is how many people there are here who claim an affiliation with ISIS and how well they can organize themselves to sweep the country with violence. 
Should either of these groups rise up and fulfill their promises, we could see a bloodbath in the streets. That would be all the excuse that Obama would need, in order to declare martial law and keep Trump out of office. 
Whether he could get away with that, or whether he would be forcibly removed from the White House in such an event is yet to be seen. At that point, it would be up to the military and the Secret Service to remember their vows and decide to take action. 
The President Elect 
But letâ€™s assume for a moment that none of this happens and the transition of governmental power goes through smoothly, as it has so many times before. What then can we expect? 
The first big question thatâ€™s in everyoneâ€™s mind is whether Trump will live up to his campaign promises or not. The mainstream media has been calling him a liar for months now, even if that required them lying to do so. Theyâ€™ve painted him with the same brush used on any politician, that of bending the truth to meet their needs and telling the people what they want to hear, just so that they can garner votes. 
The real question is whether Trump is just another politician or if heâ€™s who he claims to be; and the kicker is that nobody truly knows. Since the mainstream media has done everything they can to paint him in a negative light, the picture of Trump that weâ€™ve seen is a clouded one, at best. 
But Trump has been a public figure for more than just his campaign. For years, heâ€™s been one of Americaâ€™s most-recognized citizens. While that has not always been good, it has given us some insight into who the man is, what he believes and how he operates. 
Throughout the campaign, there have been people coming forth who have known Trump through the years. Some were employees who praised him as a boss. Others were ordinary citizens who talked about kind deeds that he did for them. But other than the attempts to paint him as a sexual abuser right before the elections, few have come forth to say anything negative about their dealings with the Trump. 
Considering how much of a public figure he has been, I would think that if he was anything like what the mainstream media has tried to paint him to be, we would have all seen it by now. 
The one truly worrying thing about Trump is that for most of his life heâ€™s been a Democrat. Heâ€™s supported the Democrat Party and Democrat candidates; heâ€™s even reportedly friends with the Clintons. So itâ€™s a bit hard to accept that he is now a staunch conservative, committed to conservative ideals. 
Yet, heâ€™s making all the right noises and all the right moves to show himself as a conservative. The list of Supreme Court Justice candidates that heâ€™s put together is impressively conservative. He also came forth with the most conservative platform that the Republican Party has seen in 20 years. 
Then thereâ€™s his â€œcontractâ€ with the American People. The actions heâ€™s promised to undertake in his first 100 days in office are clearly conservative, hitting on all the high points of his campaign and many of the silent majorityâ€™s biggest concerns. 
The Transition 
Over the next several weeks, we will be able to see Trump in action as a leader. His first big job is to select his cabinet, something that is traditionally announced by Thanksgiving. This should be interesting. One of the ways that Trump has been successful in business is in his selection of managers. He has always sought out the most qualified and competent, giving them the authority and responsibility to do whatever was necessary. 
This even came through in his hit television show, â€œThe Apprentice.â€ At its core, that show was about picking the best possible person to run a business. The various tests and challenges the candidates faced were all about testing their ability to effectively run a business. Who cares about theory; Trump wanted people who could think outside the box and get things done. 
So we can expect the same out of his cabinet selections. No, Iâ€™m not saying that heâ€™s going to run it like a game show. What Iâ€™m saying is that heâ€™s going to look for competence. For people who can think outside the box, and for people who can get things done. 
The country is in need of such people. We are a country in crisis, and itâ€™s going to take some new ideas and some out of box thinking to straighten it out. We canâ€™t expect Trump to do it all himself, heâ€™s going to have to select the right people and let them do their jobs. So the people he selects in the next few weeks are critical to the effectiveness of his presidency. 
From the few positions that have been announced so far, it looks like Trump is going to be putting together a dream team. Trey Goudy has been mentioned for Attorney General, Ben Carson as the Surgeon General and Newt Gingrich as a possibility for the Secretary of State. 
While none of these is definite yet, they show the caliber of people who Trump is looking at. He wants the best, not just some political figure whoâ€™s looking to get their ticket punched. 
While Iâ€™m sure that some top spots will go to political figures, especially those who have hopped aboard Trumpâ€™s bandwagon, heâ€™s looking more to the business sector, than he is to the normal pool of politicians only. This fits with the whole tone of his campaign, which has been about the American people taking our government back from the political class. 
The Election 
If anything, this election has shown how sick and tired the average American is with what has become the political ruling class. The Founding Fathers never envisioned such a group for our country and did everything in their power to prevent it. Yet, even with the constraints of the Constitution to guide us, we have drifted that way more and more for over a century. 
The American people are a fiercely independent people, and this election has shown that we havenâ€™t lost that independence. This isnâ€™t a partisan move, but one that has been clearly shown in both major political parties. 
Millions of Democrats abandoned the partyâ€™s chosen candidate and followed Bernie Sanders, who came close to winning, even with all the voter fraud that was used to defeat him. On the Republican side, the electorate has abandoned a wide-ranging field of establishment candidates, in favor of Trump, a political outsider. 
But the truly amazing thing was that both Democrats and Republicans voted for Trump, many abandoning their lifelong party affiliation to do so. 
This is a clear mandate to Washington that We the People are tired of business as normal. We are tired of a political ruling class. We are tired of our elected leaders treating us like nothing more than peasants. We are tired of being lied to, and we are tired of being mistreated by those who are supposed to serve us. 
This election has been a breakwater; leaving behind the old system and its corruption, in favor of a new order. 
One that returns back to the values this country was founded upon and back to running the country according to the Constitution. Not an adulterated version of the Constitution; not a modified version; not even a version thatâ€™s been twisted and tortured by the various laws passed through the years; but the Constitution itself. 
Itâ€™s up to Trump to ensure that he follows through on his promises and doesnâ€™t let things go back to the old way. But itâ€™s up to you and I as well. We have our part in this presidency; that of keeping an eye on our President Elect and making sure that he does what he said heâ€™d do. If not, we need to get rid of him. 
Hopefully, Washington will get the message, and the political class will stop acting like our masters and start acting like public servants once again. If that doesnâ€™t happen, then the breakwater has been nothing more than a symbol; and a worthless symbol at that. 
If change is going to happen in Washington, it canâ€™t just happen in the White House, it has to happen in both houses of Congress as well. But it needs to go farther than that; it needs to permeate every department of the federal government as well. 
We the People have spoken. Weâ€™ve used our voice in the voting booth, selecting an outsider to take control of our government and give it back to the people. But we canâ€™t stop now. 
That message needs to keep going forth, to make sure that the politicians and bureaucrats hear it, and that they fear us and the power we wield over them. Until they do, it is we who fear them.

21182,Are The Polls Rigged Against Trump? All Of These Wildly Divergent Surveys Cannot Possibly Be Correct,Michael Snyder,"Reuters/Ipsos: Clinton +4 Monmouth: Clinton +12 There is a 14 point swing between the polls that show Trump up by 2 points and the polls that show Clinton up by 12 points. This should not be happening. There is no way in the world that there should be a 14 point difference between scientific polls at this stage in the game. On November 8th the polling organizations that were way off are going to be exposed, and it will be exceedingly difficult for them to regain their credibility afterwards. At this point, some of the largest news organizations in the country are openly projecting a Clinton landslide. For example, Reuters says that Clinton now has a 95 percent chance of winning â€¦ Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is on a definite path to the White House, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll. The survey, released Saturday, found that Clinton is on track to win more than 300 votes in the Electoral College, which would solidly secure her the presidency. If the election were held this week, Clinton would win 326 Electoral College votes while Trump would win only 212, the poll said. According to Reuters, Clinton currently has a 95 percent chance of winning the White House . If Reuters isnâ€™t right about this they are going to end up looking awfully foolish. An analysis by the Associated Press also has Clinton as the overwhelming favorite. And it is true that the poll results coming out of individual states seem to show Clinton with a seemingly insurmountable lead on the electoral map . But once again, can we trust those polls? Trump has regularly dismissed the national polls, but on Sunday his campaign manager did admit on national television that they are losing. The following comes from the New York Post â€¦ Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign manager on Sunday acknowledged something her boss hates to do â€” losing. â€œWe are behind,â€ Kellyanne Conway admitted on NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€ The GOP nominee routinely brushes off negative polling as untrustworthy but Conway said Democrat Hillary Clinton does have an edge. However, it is important to remember that the big national polls have been very wrong in the past. Back in 1980, a Gallup survey that was released on October 26th showed Ronald Reagan trailing Jimmy Carter by 8 points, but of course Reagan went on to win the election by a landslide â€¦ â€œFor weeks before the presidential election, the gurus of public opinion polling were nearly unanimous in their findings,â€ wrote John F. Stacks for TIME in April 1980. â€œIn survey after survey, they agreed that the coming choice between President Jimmy Carter and challenger Ronald Reagan was â€˜too close to call.â€™ A few points at most, they said, separated the two major contenders. â€œBut when the votes were counted, the former California Governor had defeated Carter by a margin of 51% to 41% in the popular vote â€” a rout for a U.S. presidential race. In the electoral college, the Reagan victory was a 10-to-1 avalanche that left the President holding only six states and the District of Columbia.â€ Could a similar thing happen on November 8th? Without a doubt, Trump supporters are far more enthusiastic than Clinton supporters are, and that matters. The key on election day is to get your voters to turn out in large numbers, and the fact that Donald Trump is drawing record crowds to his rallies is a very good sign. But even if Donald Trump legitimately wins the election, it could still be stolen from him via election fraud. In recent days Democrats have been playing down the idea that this could possibly happen, but the truth is that even Barack Obama has admitted that election fraud is a major problem in the past. For instance, just consider what he said about this back in 2008 â€¦ â€œWell, I tell you what it helps in Ohio, that we got Democrats in charge of the machines,â€ Obama said regarding the threat of election-rigging. He continued, â€œWhenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to tilt things in their direction. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve got to have, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is nonpartisan, and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud.â€ â€œThatâ€™s why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after youâ€™ve punched that letterâ€”make sure it hasnâ€™t been hacked into,â€ he added, admitting that even Democrats have â€œmonkeyed aroundâ€ with election results: â€œI want to be honest, itâ€™s not as if itâ€™s just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes, Democrats have, too.â€ I know that these comments almost sound too good to be true, but you can actually watch video of Obama making these comments right here . And it is odd that he specifically mentioned Democrats having control of the voting machines in Ohio, because I documented extreme voting irregularities in Ohio in the last election during a recent visit to Morningside . And an increasing number of Americans are starting to become concerned about election fraud. In fact, a brand new Reuters survey found that 70 percent of Republicans believe that if Hillary Clinton wins the election it will be â€œ because of illegal voting or vote riggingâ€. So even if Hillary Clinton gets into the White House, she may find that she has an exceedingly difficult time trying to govern the nation. A lot of people have made a lot of predictions about the outcome of this election, and we donâ€™t have very long until we find out who was right and who was wrong. At this point, voting has already begun in many states, and the early results in Nevada donâ€™t look encouraging for the Trump campaign â€¦ According to the estimable Nevada journalist Jon Ralston , Democrats have a 20-percentage-point turnout edge so far based on early and absentee voting in Clark County (home to Las Vegas), Nevada. And they have a 10-point edge in Washoe County (home to Reno). But in the key swing state of Florida, so far 498,153 Republicans have voted compared to just 478,175 Democrats . So that would seem to be some very good news for the Trump campaign, because Trump cannot win without carrying the state of Florida . To me it seems as though Americans are more emotionally invested in this campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign in decades. The stakes are incredibly high, and in just over two weeks we will find out what happens. Let us just hope and pray that America makes the right choice. Submit your review"
21183,Iraqi Forces Take Eastern Mosul From Islamic State - The New York Times,Rick Gladstone,"Iraqâ€™s government forces said on Wednesday that they had gained control of the eastern half of Mosul, three months after they began an assault to retake the northern city from Islamic State militants. The Iraqi advance  â€”   the biggest military operation in the years since the United States ended its occupation of the country in 2011  â€”   was aided by American air support and military advisers. But after weeks of heavy fighting and high casualties in areas of Mosul east of the Tigris River, the older and more densely populated western neighborhoods of the city remain in Islamic State hands. Mosul, which was Iraqâ€™s   city when the Islamic State seized it in 2014, has become a focal point in the broader battle to crush the Islamic State, the Sunni extremist group that claimed to have established a new Islamic caliphate in areas of Iraq and Syria. Tens of thousands of Mosul residents have fled since the Iraqi military began the recapturing operation in October, beginning with sparsely populated outer districts. Roughly a million civilians are believed to still be in the city. Members of Iraqâ€™s counterterrorism service were the lead fighters in seizing eastern Mosul, and they faced ferocious resistance from Islamic State defenders who had planted booby traps and sent suicide bombers to stop them. American warplanes sought to block the Islamic State from reinforcing fighters in the east by bombing the Tigris bridges linking it to the western side. Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati of the Iraqi Army said on Wednesday that his forces had effectively taken control of the eastern side, declaring that â€œimportant lines and important areas are finished. â€ He spoke at a news conference in Bartella, a town east of Mosul. Prime Minister Haider   of Iraq, in a statement posted on his Twitter account, extolled what he described as â€œthe efforts of our brave forcesâ€ to retake Mosul. It remains unclear how long it may take to clear the western half, which is characterized by narrow streets that could make the fight against entrenched Islamic State fighters even more treacherous. The triumphal moment on Wednesday was tempered by growing exasperation in the western city of Falluja, where Iraqi forces and allied militias routed Islamic State fighters more than six months ago. Many neighborhoods were destroyed in that battle, and residents have increasingly complained that much of the city remains uninhabitable. In a dispatch from the   Falluja, Agence   quoted civilians as saying the lack of reconstruction, services and jobs threatened to rekindle the resentment toward the   government in Baghdad that had helped incubate support for the Islamic State among some members of the Sunni Arab minority. Iraqi officials have said they lack money for reconstruction, hobbled by the countryâ€™s overreliance on its oil industry, which has been repeatedly disrupted by war and depressed by low prices."

21186,Geller: MILO to Speak at AFDI #CancelSarsour Protest at CUNY - Breitbart,Pamela Geller,"Join us May 25 at CUNY offices on 42nd street to protest the invitation to BDS leader Linda Sarsour to keynote CUNYâ€™s Commencement ceremony. Sarsour was invited by Ayman   the dean of CUNYâ€™s Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. CUNY is standing by its decision to honor the Muslim activist. Such sanction is so malignant and so evil, it cannot be ignored. There is a responsibility for the time we are living in. [We had to reschedule the protest from June 1 (the day of Sarsourâ€™s keynote speech at CUNY) because it is the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, and so many proud Jews wanted to attend. It was wrong for CUNY to schedule the commencement ceremonies on Shavuot  â€”   the day that the Torah was given by Gâ€‘d to the Jewish people. Over 25% of the student body is Jewish. The fact that the commencement address is on Shavuot is another reason CUNY should cancel Sarsour and   the commencement. What are Jewish students supposed to do? They either violate their holiday or miss their graduation.  JUST ANNOUNCED: MILO WILL BE SPEAKING. Speakers at our event include: Universities have disinvited Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Nonie Darwish, Ann Coulter, Milo, and legions of conservative thinkers and voices in defense of freedom, but a   and   activist they will defend to the death. We will be there. We will protest  â€”   this will not stand. Be there  â€”  MAY 25TH, CUNY Center, 217 E 42nd St, New York, NY   United States, from 12 â€”   2:00pm. RSVP on Facebook.  An outspoken critic of Israel, Sarsour avidly supports the Boycott, Divestment  Sanctions (BDS) movement, a   initiative that uses various forms of public protest, economic pressure, and lawsuits to advance the Hamas agenda of permanently destroying Israel as a Jewish  .    the ongoing   conflict, Sarsour favors a   solution where an Arab majority and a Jewish minority would live together within the borders of a single country. In October 2012 she tweeted  that â€œnothing is creepier than Zionism. â€ In 2004, Sarsour acknowledged that a friend of hers, as well as a cousin, were both serving long sentences in Israeli jails because of their efforts to recruit jihadists to murder Jews. Moreover, she revealed that her    was serving a   prison term because of his affiliation with Hamas. In October 2011, Linda Sarsour, who holds   economics in low regard, expressed, on behalf of â€œMuslim New Yorkers,â€ â€œsolidarity and supportâ€ for the   Occupy Wall Street movement. In 2011 as well, the Obama Administration honored Sarsour as a â€œchampion of change. â€ Not surprisingly, Sarsour visited the White House on at least seven different occasions during Obamaâ€™s tenure. In May 2012 Sarsour tweeted that the   â€œunderwear bomber,â€ an   operative who in 2009 had tried to blow up a   passenger jet in   was actually a CIA agent participating in Americaâ€™s â€œwar on Islam. â€ In November 2012 in Baltimore, Sarsour â€”  ever eager to peddle her woeful tale of Islamic victimhood â€”  spoke at a Muslim Public Affairs Council conference titled â€œFacing Race: Xenophobic Hate Crimes. â€ This is the same Council that views the murderous   of Hezbollah as members of â€œa liberation movementâ€ that is â€œfighting for freedom. â€ Sarsour was outraged when a police officer and an FBI agent shot and killed a young black Muslim named Usaama Rahim in Boston on June 2, 2015, when Rahim lunged at them with a   knife as they attempted to question him about suspected   activities. Naturally, Sarsourâ€™s assessment of the incident confidently traced everything back to race: â€œAt the end of the day, a Black man was shot on a bus stop on his way to work and we should treat this like any other case of police violence. â€ In August 2015 Sarsour spoke out in support of the incarcerated Palestinian Islamic Jihad member Muhammad Allan, a known recruiter of suicide bombers. According to CounterJihad. com, Sarsour has attended and spoken at numerous rallies sponsored by   a group that views Israel as a terrorist, genocidal state whose very creation was a â€œcatastropheâ€ for Arab peoples. Sarsour has also solicited donations for the Palestine Childrenâ€™s Relief Fund, which had worked with the   Holy Land Foundation. Thereâ€™s more. She also initially portrayed the killing of Shaima Alawadi by her husband as a     killing instead. The leftâ€™s chokehold on the nationâ€™s most powerful institutions continues, despite a Trump presidency and a Republican Congress, but this is a step too far. Sarsour being given the honor of commencement speaker is so malignant and so evil, it cannot be ignored. There is a responsibility for the time we are living in.

21187,"Make Pakistan Free Afghan/Pashtun National Hero, Shabat Gula",Kadir A. Mohmand,"By Kadir A. Mohmand on October 30, 2016 
â€œSEARCH FOR THE AFGHAN GIRLâ€Â© Steve McCurry 
I am writing on behalf of the Afghan villagers like Sharbat Gula because the U. S. installed Afghan administration only works on behalf of the occupiers and war profiteers. The Afghan administration does not care about Sharbat Gula. 
Shame on you Pakistan for imprisoning the national Afghan war hero, Sharbat Gula , who is again suffering because of the foreign occupierâ€™s and its Afghan puppetsâ€™ bombardment of her village in Afghanistan. Sharbat Gula is now suffering at the greedy hands of Pakistan, who financially benefits from the U.S. war against the Afghans/Pashtun. 
In the 1980s, her young face on the cover of National Geographic embodied the strength, dignity and honor of the Afghan Pashtun women, who suffered for a decade at the hands of the Soviet invaders and Afghan communist puppets. 
During both wars, Pakistan has profited from the Afghansâ€™ suffering. After 9/11, the National Geographic editor/photographer located Sharbat Gula. He told her a lot of money had been made from the edition with her cover and what did she want. She did not want money. Sharbat Gula only wanted an education for her children and no bombardment of her village. She wanted education and peace without foreign invasion. 
Her village has been bombarded by the U.S. and its puppets, her villageâ€™s water poisoned and her family has had to flee to Pakistan. Instead of honoring her, Pakistan imprisons her for not having the right papers. Also Pakistan punishes the Afghan Pashtun refugees because the Afghan Freedom fighters do not want Pakistan involved in peace negotiations. . The Afghan Freedom Fighters d o not want a repeat of the mistakes that occurred in the 1980s when Pakistan was involved in the peace talks between the Soviet Union and the Afghan Resistance. 
Sharbat Gula is again the face of the Afghan Pashtun women,. Despite the indignities of war, she keeps her honor and dignity. 
Pakistan needs to release her immediately. Perpetrators of war crimes committed against the Afghan Pashtun women need to be prosecuted and stopped. She is a victim. Sharbat Gula has human rights. The illegal war in Afghanistan must end now. Sharbat Gula has the right to live with dignity and security in her village in Afghanistan. She does not want to be forced to live in Pakistan. Enough of these greedy profiteers and this ugly war scape goating honorable Afghan Pashtun women like Sharbat Gula, who are the true national heroes. Sharbat Gula is an Afghan National Hero and not a criminal. The war criminals and war profiteers need to be imprisoned and not her. Free her now.

21188,"Newsweek Publishes Robert Reich Conspiracy Theory, Claims Berkeley Rioters Were Paid by Breitbart - Breitbart",Charlie Nash,"Newsweek have published a conspiracy theory written by UC Berkeleyâ€™s Professor of Public Policy and former Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, questioning whether the   rioters at Berkeley last week were paid by Breitbart News. [â€œThursday night, Yiannopoulos had a friendly interview on Fox Newsâ€™s â€˜Tucker Carlson Tonightâ€™  â€”   a show that, according to the Washington Post, has ridden anger at   activism into    prime time ratings,â€ wrote Reich on Saturday. â€œYiannopoulos wasnâ€™t asked about the content of the speech that was shut down. The conversation focused instead on how Berkeley proved the point that the Left was ceding its right to federal grants by cracking down on free speech. Which raises the possibility that Yiannopoulos and Brietbart were in cahoots with the agitators, in order to lay the groundwork for a Trump crackdown on universities and their federal funding. â€  After repeatedly misspelling â€œBreitbart,â€ Reich then asked his readers to â€œconnect these dots,â€ in typical conspiracy theory form, before adding â€œI donâ€™t want to add to the conspiratorial musings of so many about this very conspiratorial administration, but it strikes me there may be something worrying going on here. â€ Reich, who works directly for the college administration at Berkeley, has repeatedly floated this conspiracy theory since the riot last week. He first suggested it in a CNN segment with host Don Lemon. In addition to not shutting down Reich when he made his baseless allegation, CNNâ€™s Lemon egged him on from the start, opening his segment by saying that the violence at Berkeley â€œplayed right into the hands of the   white supremacist   â€¦     someone like Milo Yiannopoulos. â€ Then, instead of challenging Reichâ€™s allegations, Lemon asked him to expand on them. â€œYou think this was a strategy by Yiannopoulos or  ? They put this on in an effort to show that thereâ€™s no free speech on a college campus like UC Berkeley?â€ Reich went on to say that he â€œwouldnâ€™t bet against it. â€ â€œDespite admitting explicitly that the claim was not based on facts, Reich charged ahead in claiming that Breitbart News had an affiliation with the violent rioters that lit fires around campus and beat and pepper sprayed the MILO supporters who were waiting to get into the venue,â€ reported Breitbart Newsâ€™ Tom Ciccotta last week, after Reich initially pitched the conspiracy. Rush Limbaugh also mocked Reichâ€™s claims on his own show. The riot started at UC Berkeley on Wednesday after protesters against Breitbart Senior Editor MILO became increasingly violent outside of his show. â€œ â€ started several fires, smashed windows and ATMs, looted downtown stores, attacked cars, and assaulted dozens of MILO fans, male and female, who they falsely accused of being â€œNazis. â€ Despite the large amount of violence, numerous reports indicate that police officers refused to intervene, and only one suspect was arrested. On Sunday, Breitbart News reported that one of the groups behind the riot, Refuse Fascism, had received $50, 000 from a group backed by socialist billionaire George Soros.

21189,"After â€˜The Biggest Loser,â€™ Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight - The New York Times",Gina Kolata,"Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of NBCâ€™s reality television show â€œThe Biggest Loser,â€ shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  â€”   an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months. When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec. 8, 2009, he weighed just 191 pounds, down from 430. Dressed in a   and   shorts, he was lean, athletic and as handsome as a model. â€œIâ€™ve got my life back,â€ he declared. â€œI mean, I feel like a million bucks. â€ Mr. Cahill left the showâ€™s stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar. As he heard from fans all over the world, his elation knew no bounds. But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts. In fact, most of that seasonâ€™s 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now. Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8â€™s contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose. Kevin Hall, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the â€œBiggest Loserâ€ contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise. The results, the researchers said, were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss. â€œIt is frightening and amazing,â€ said Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. â€œI am just blown away. â€ It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  â€”   even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  â€”   will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that â€œThe Biggest Loserâ€ contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended. What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestantsâ€™ metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight. Mr. Cahill was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat. The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nationâ€™s obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology. Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is â€œnew and important. â€ â€œThe key point is that you can be on TV, you can lose enormous amounts of weight, you can go on for six years, but you canâ€™t get away from a basic biological reality,â€ said Dr. Schwartz, who was not involved in the study. â€œAs long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back. â€ The showâ€™s doctor, Robert Huizenga, says he expected the contestantsâ€™ metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned, though, whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off. â€œUnfortunately, many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors, psychologists, sleep specialists, and trainers  â€”   and thatâ€™s something we all need to work hard to change,â€ he said in an email. The studyâ€™s findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions, and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people. The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life. Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies, which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights, whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off. There is always a weight a personâ€™s body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  â€”   it may be an effect of aging  â€”   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail. Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, who was not involved in the research, said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But, he added, the findings made sense. â€œThis is a subset of the most successfulâ€ dieters, he said. â€œIf they donâ€™t show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?â€ Still, he added, â€œthat shouldnâ€™t be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches. â€ Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved, they say, can progress truly be made against obesity. â€œThere is a lot of basic research we still need to do,â€ said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer. Her group is testing a drug that, in animals at least, acts like leptin, a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin. While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active, the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: Erinn Egbert, a   caregiver for her mother in Versailles, Ky. And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size. â€œWhat people donâ€™t understand is that a treat is like a drug,â€ said Ms. Egbert, who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show, and now weighs between 152 and 157. â€œTwo treats can turn into a binge over a   period. That is what I struggle with. â€ Six years after Season 8 ended, 14 of the 16 contestants went to the N. I. H. last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked, but on further reflection, decided the numbers explained a lot. â€œAll my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,â€ Mr. Cahill said. â€œThe moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, â€˜This is not right. Something is wrong with my body. â€™â€ Sean Algaier, 36, a pastor from Charlotte, N. C. feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again, and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size. â€œItâ€™s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence,â€ he said. Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though. They constantly battled hunger, cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the seasonâ€™s finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned, their leptin levels drifted up again, but only to about half of what they had been when the season began, the researchers found, thus helping to explain their urges to eat. Leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger, and although Dr. Hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them, another group of researchers, in a different project, did. In a   study funded by Australiaâ€™s National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds, but over the next year, the pounds started coming back. Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose. â€œWhat was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is,â€ Dr. Proietto said. â€œThe body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use. â€ Mr. Cahill, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat, then fatter. He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward, he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with shame. Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485. â€œI used to look at myself and think, â€˜I am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman,â€™â€ he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating. â€œI remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought, â€˜I should just run out in front of a car. â€™â€ He eventually seized on â€œThe Biggest Loserâ€ as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected. Before the show began, the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the â€œBiggest Loserâ€ ranch with the other contestants, Mr. Cahill exercised seven hours a day, burning 8, 000 to 9, 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating, consuming many fewer calories than before. Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own. Mr. Cahill set a goal of a   deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it. His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a. m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  â€”   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower, ride home, eat lunch  â€”   typically a grilled skinless chicken breast, a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise. If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times, he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his   indicator reset to zero at midnight. On the day of the   on the showâ€™s finale, Mr. Cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained, to their surprise and horror, after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in. Mr. Cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever, and for the next four years, he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago, he went back to his job as a surveyor, and the pounds started coming back. Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. Cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again, to 275, then 295. His slow metabolism is part of the problem, and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few. â€œIâ€™d eat five bites. Then Iâ€™d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, â€˜What did I do? â€™â€ Dr. Lee Kaplan, an obesity researcher at Harvard, says the brain sets the number of calories we consume, and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories. Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the bodyâ€™s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still, pounds can insidiously creep on. â€œWe eat about 900, 000 to a million calories a year, and burn them all except those annoying 3, 000 to 5, 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds,â€ he said. â€œThese very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  â€”   less than one Starburst candy  â€”   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating. â€ â€œIt is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging,â€ Dr. Rosenbaum added. The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. Hall said. Yes, there are signals to regain weight, but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out. He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain, and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost, they were, without realizing it, eating an additional 200 calories a day. Those extra calories, Dr. Hall said, were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry. â€œUnless they continue to fight it constantly, they will regain the weight,â€ he said. All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  â€”     or   diets, for example  â€”   and to exercise and   drugs, among other interventions. But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. â€œThere are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories,â€ he said, but he added that â€œfor most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  â€”   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months. â€ Dr. Rosenbaum agreed. â€œThe difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ,â€ he said. Mr. Cahill knows that now. And with his report from Dr. Hallâ€™s group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain. â€œThat shame that was on my shoulders went off,â€ he said."
21190,"American Nightmare: Tyranny Under the FBI, an American Reality (Part III)","Gordon Duff, Senior Editor","By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 3, 2016 Hoover and Tolson 
When Supreme Court Justice John Scalia died, under mysterious circumstances, FBI officials were there. It was the FBI that blocked the autopsy of a Supreme Court Justice, required by law to be supervised by the Surgeon General of the United States. 
The organization Scalia belonged to and was with when he died, or was murdered as some assert, includes top leaders of all American business sectors along with government officials, both elected and â€œcareer,â€ who regularly meet and plan the overthrow of the American government. 
The Trump team includes the public persona of Rudy Guiliani, tasked with organizing the FBI revolt, wielding bushels of cash from the Saudis and the Adelson gambling/trafficking empire. Guiliani and his friends control most post-retirement employment for FBI agents, all of which filters through firms connected to or represented by his law firm. The FBI is, in fact, controlled by Rudy Guiliani, according to some sources. 
We saw the tip of that this week when Rudy Guiliani, according to the Daily Beast , reached inside the FBI and moved them clearly into the Trump campaign. Illegal though these acts are, as you may read below, they openly bragged about it. You see, with Congress and the FBI under control, investigations are a tool of punishment and intimidation only: 
â€œTwo days before FBI director James Comey rocked the world last week, Rudy Giuliani was on Fox, where he volunteered, un-prodded by any question: â€œI think heâ€™s [Donald Trump] got a surprise or two that youâ€™re going to hear about in the next few days. I mean, Iâ€™m talking about some pretty big surprises.â€ Pressed for specifics, he said: â€œWeâ€™ve got a couple of things up our sleeve that should turn this thing around.â€ 
The man who now leads â€œlock-her-upâ€ chants at Trump rallies spent decades of his life as a federal prosecutor and then mayor working closely with the FBI, and especially its New York office. One of Giulianiâ€™s security firms employed a former head of the New York FBI office, and other alumni of it. It was agents of that office, probing Anthony Weinerâ€™s alleged sexting of a minor, who pressed Comey to authorize the review of possible Hillary Clinton-related emails on a Weiner device that led to the explosive letter the director wrote Congress. 
Hours after Comeyâ€™s letter about the renewed probe was leaked on Friday, Giuliani went on a radio show and attributed the directorâ€™s surprise action to â€œthe pressure of a group of FBI agents who donâ€™t look at it politically.â€ 
â€˜The other rumor that I get is that thereâ€™s a kind of revolution going on inside the FBI about the original conclusion [not to charge Clinton] being completely unjustified and almost a slap in the face to the FBIâ€™s integrity,â€ said Giuliani. â€œI know that from former agents. I know that even from a few active agents.'â€ 
Key to understanding the problem is understanding the nature of the â€œindependenceâ€ of the FBI. Established at a time when organized crime ran rampant across the nation, the FBI, operating outside any constitutional authority and in direct contravention of constitutional law, grew from small number of unarmed legal consultants to a government within the government. 
With the advent of World War II, the FBI grew to massive strength and began operating around the world. They were given broad powers to mete out justice, unlimited powers of search and arrest, of surveillance and even summary execution when they deemed in the national interest. 
With the Cold War, the FBI rode the Red Menace scare to infinite power while partnering with organized crime. J. Edgar Hoover often denied that organized crime existed and was later to have been discovered a victim of blackmail at the hands of Meyer Lansky. From VT: 
â€œNo provision was established within the constitution to regulate or oversee a national police force, it didnâ€™t take long for the FBI to become the Cheka within a short period after itâ€™s creation, J. Edgar Hoover, turned â€˜the bureauâ€™ into a monstrosity blackmailing politicians and cozying up to crime figures while Hooverâ€™s FBI chased â€˜commiesâ€™ both real and imaginary, it protected not only the mafia but powerful international crime cartels as well, becoming the real â€˜Murder Inc.â€™ Taxpayer financed strong-arm thugs supported by a disinformation campaign. 
Hoover gained control of the press almost immediately, keeping files on his press enemies, threatening and blackmailing; some of this was to protect his own secrets â€“ mob ties and his notorious penchant for sexual deviance, now long in the public domain, but it went further â€“ it was all about power. 
â€˜Maryâ€™ Hoover liked to dress as a woman and was infamously covertly photographed along with his longtime companion and lover Clyde Tolson in flagrante delicto; those photographs came into the possession of mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, thus ensnaring Hoover, and by extension the entire FBI in a dangerous marriage with the mob. There is no evidence they ever got divorced, though from time to time the relationship may have been somewhat rocky.â€ 
With the Watergate scandals, the FBI made the case for being made â€œunanswerableâ€ to executive authority, even the President or Attorney General. Instead, their only oversight is within the House of Representatives. 
However, with the Tea Party takeover of the House, financed by gambling boss Sheldon Adelson, and based on illegal reapportionment of the House districts, defended by a radicalized Supreme Court in continual 5/4 deadlock, the House got out of control, running continual investigations based on internet rumors and conspiracy theories. 
Too offset their zeal and insanity, a well run FBI might well have investigated the House itself, finding drug and gambling/human trafficking funds filling its coffers, opened and placed above the law by the 5/4 Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that legalized unlimited unaccounted offshore funds used to bribe officials. 
According to informants, this cabal, including FBI and Pentagon officials, has discussed assassinations of American leaders, military and intelligence support for terror groups and maintains strong ties, through Cuba, with the drug cartels of Mexico and Columbia. 
When the Oregon â€œStandoffâ€ defendants were found â€œnot guilty,â€ it was the FBI that scuttled the case because it was the FBI, through informants that run the majority of the violent anti-government supremacist/anti-Semitic groups, that planned the takeover of Federal land at gunpoint. 
From a Spencer Ackerman article in the UK Guardian, November 3, 2016 
One agent called the bureau â€˜Trumplandia,â€™ with some colleagues openly discussing voting for the Republican nominee. 
Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comeyâ€™s July public decision not to recommend indictment over Clintonâ€™s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. 
â€œThe FBI is Trumpland,â€ said one current agent. 
This atmosphere raises major questions about how Comey and the bureau he is slated to run for the next seven years can work with Clinton should she win the White House. 
The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is â€œthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,â€ and that â€œthe reason why theyâ€™re leaking is theyâ€™re pro-Trump.â€ 
The agent called the bureau â€œTrumplandia,â€ with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the partyâ€™s national-security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected. 
On the other side is the Pentagon. The conspiracy theories and rumors are still flying about â€œBarksdale/Minot.â€ Back in 2006, a B52 took off from Minot Air Force Base with a full load of hydrogen bombs. They were â€œillegallyâ€ or â€œimproperlyâ€ authorized and were being flown out of the United States, we are told, to Diego Garcia. 
Since that time, hundreds of officers, including the entire American nuclear command, have been replaced. We have it on reliable authority, at the highest levels, that officers inside the Pentagon, many recruited into religious extremist organizations operating at the service academies, West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, had been channeled into positions of authority by a religious cult that sprung up in the early 1980s at the Presidio, a one time Army base in San Francisco, California. 
Among the founders of that movement were General Paul Vallely, who along with Michael Aquino (rank unknown at this time), founded Americaâ€™s psychological warfare capability but also founded the Temple of Set, a Satanic cult that spread through the American military. Remember, it was the FBI that in 1992 declared that the ritual satanic killings of the 1970s and 80s including the alleged abuses on 15 military bases tied to the Temple of Set, were only â€œconspiracy theories.â€ 
It is Vallelyâ€™s group, Stand Up America, that has attracted so many pro-Trump FBI agents. This is one of the paths that tie the FBI to the Pentagon, through Montanaâ€™s â€œpatriot elites,â€ many military and intelligence contractors, all right wing, many anti-government and all closet militia backers. 
Before that, it was the FBIâ€™s SSAIC (Supervising Special Agent In Charge) from the FBIâ€™s massive Los Angeles office, Ted Gunderson, that the fight against ritual abuse and human trafficking that led to a series of quashed investigations that led into the highest levels of Washington. After his retirement,Gunderson went on a personal crusade against the FBI for covering up ritual child abuse. Gunderson was approached by a number of informants and volunteers, who turned out to be his undoing. Two came to live with him, Tim XXXX and Stew XXXX, who looted his files and turned them over to the FBI. 
These individuals, who still work with the InfoWars organization run by Alex Jones, a Trump advisor and confidant, who also helped organize the Oregon Standoff. 
Conclusion 
We are told that we have at least 100 FBI agents who have submitted resignations if Hillary Clinton is not arrested. They claim, we are told by former Representative Tom Delay, they have extensive knowledge of her case and a coverup within the FBI. 
Only a few short years ago, the same story of FBI resignations was based on another assertion, that the FBI was involved in a criminal coverup of President Obamaâ€™s foreign birth. 
What we do know is this, the FBI is not just politicized. They are working hand in hand with obstructionists in congress, adding to the legislative abuses of separation of powers something far more sinister. The FBI is abusing the justice system as well, fabricating evidence, planting emails, intimidating witnesses, quashing investigations and openly involving themselves in the political process. 
There is currently NO public confidence in the FBI, in its director and, similarly, there is no public confidence in rank and file agents as well. The barrel is all rotten apples, there is nothing else but. 
President Obama has cited the FBI for politically oriented leaks. We fear that Obama, who should be obligated to act, with do nothing out of fear of being accused of â€œleadership.â€ 
We wonder what he has to lose."

21192,EU Officials Increasingly Fear a Marine Le Pen Upset in France,John J. Xenakis,"This morningâ€™s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics. com,    politicians: Marine Le Pen of France, and Brexit champion Nigel Farage of Britain (AFP) Marine Le Pen, leader of Franceâ€™s   Front National party is still considered to be a very long shot to become the next president of France, but it is no longer considered an impossibility, mainly because of three factors: the unexpected passage of the Brexit referendum in Britain last year, the unexpected election of Donald Trump in the US last year, and a trend of rising nationalistic political parties in countries across Europe in recent years. The first round of the presidential elections will be held on Sunday, April 23. There are 11 candidates, so it is almost impossible for anyone to win by getting over 50% of the vote. The top two candidates will then take part in a runoff election on May 7, to determine the final winner. President FranÃ§ois Hollande, a Socialist, has had abysmal popularity ratings and so has chosen not to run for a second term, a decision unprecedented in modern times. The polls put the top four candidates at around 20% each. Emmanuel Macron is the youngest, a    former investment banker, and former economy minister under Hollande. He is considered to be the favorite among the mainstream â€œglobalistâ€ European politicians. The early favorite was Republican FranÃ§ois Fillon, but his support has crashed because of a scandal where he allegedly arranged for his wife to receive a large salary for a job that required little or no work.   MÃ©lenchon is the   candidate, a kind of political mirror image of Marine Le Pen, though not entirely. Le Pen is   while MÃ©lenchon is   but the two candidates do agree on one important issue: Neither of them likes the euro currency. Although Le Pen could flame out in the first round, it is widely expected that she will be one of the two leading candidates. Mainstream politicians are hoping a second round matching Le Pen with Macron. In that case, it is expected that Macron pick up voters from the candidates that have dropped out, while Le Penâ€™s core group of supporters would stay the same, with the result that Macron would defeat Le Pen by a wide margin. The scenario that most fear is that in the first round on Sunday, the two winners would be the two extremes, the   Le Pen and the   MÃ©lenchon. This would be considered a disaster for the eurozone, as either one would like to return to the original French franc currency. After last yearâ€™s unexpected Brexit and Trump victories, thereâ€™s a great deal of anxiety among European politicians who fear that anything could happened. BBC and Market Pulse and Foreign Policy and Euro News and Daily Signal, Marine Le Pen is the current leader of the Front National party, which had a strong history of   under its previous leader and founder, Marine Le Penâ€™s father,   Le Pen, a Holocaust denier. At some point, she came to the conclusion that she and the Front National party could not become successful without completely breaking its   past. She did so by breaking with her father and banning him from the party. She has not repeated any of her fatherâ€™s   remarks and has even condemned them. But in interviews, she is always asked about Jewish issues, and her answers are always heavily scrutinized by a mainstream press that is as consumed with hostility to her as with Donald Trump. One of the most controversial examples occurred in a recent interview where she insisted that France was not responsible for a July 1942 atrocity known as â€œVel dâ€™Hiv,â€ where French officials rounded up 13, 000 Jews and turned them over to the Nazis to be deported to Auschwitz. She had scrambled to explain that the â€œrealâ€ French government at that time was in exile, while the perpetrators of the atrocity were the puppet government in Paris under Nazi control. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, there are two important things to be noted here, things that Iâ€™ve written about many times. First, nationalism and xenophobia do not come from the politicians. They come from the people. If Marine Le Pen had not stepped forward to represent   and possibly   voters, then someone else would have done so, because the people were demanding it. What a politician can do is represent nationalistic and xenophobic voters, but then do everything possible to ameliorate the worst abuses of those attitudes. As Iâ€™ve noted in the past, Donald Trump has backed off from his early remarks Mexicans and Muslims, and appears to have adopted a course that takes into account the anxieties of his supporters, while preventing any abuses from taking place. Theresa May in Britain is similarly trying to chart a course that accommodates Brexit supporters, while avoiding total disaster for Britainâ€™s economy. The second important point is that nationalism and xenophobia are growing around the world. Whether itâ€™s Chinese vs Japanese, Chinese vs Vietnamese, Buddhists vs Rohingyas in Myanmar, Hindus vs Muslims in Kashmir, or Sunnis vs Shias in the Mideast, nationalism and xenophobia have been growing around the world, in one country after another. This is what always happens in a generational Crisis era, and it always leads to major wars or world wars. The Local (France) and Books and Ideas and Atlantic and News Max, The phrase â€œEuropean Projectâ€ refers to the efforts, begun in the 1950s, to take steps to prevent another massive war in Europe. Itâ€™s hard today to remember the mood of the public in those days. Hereâ€™s what Hannah Arendt wrote in her 1950 book, The Origins of Totalitarianism: Two world wars in one generation, separated by an uninterrupted chain of local wars and revolutions, followed by no peace treaty for the vanquished and no respite for the victor, have ended in the anticipation of a third World War between the two remaining world powers [America and the Soviet Union]. This moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles after all hopes have died. We no longer hope for an eventual restoration of the old world order with all its traditions, or for the reintegration of the masses of five continents who have been thrown into a chaos produced by the violence of wars and revolutions and the growing decay of all that has still been spared. Under the most diverse conditions and disparate circumstances, we watch the development of the same phenomena  â€”   homelessness on an unprecedented scale, rootlessness to an unprecedented depth. Never has our future been more unpredictable, never have we depended so much on political forces that cannot be trusted to follow the rules of common sense and    â€”   forces that look like sheer insanity, if judged by the standards of other centuries. It is as though mankind had divided itself between those who believe in human omnipotence (who think that everything is possible if one knows how to organize masses for it) and those for whom powerlessness has become the major experience of their lives. The purpose of the European Project was to prove that mankind was not completely powerless after all. If Europe could set up a new world order that would prevent the â€œsheer insanityâ€ of another world war, then the European Project would succeed. This lead to the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and eventually to the formation of the European Union. What we see today is huge centrifugal forces pulling the European Project apart. Whether it is the Brexit referendum in Britain, Marine Le Pen in France, the â€œTrue Finnsâ€ in Finland, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany, the Golden Dawn party in Greece, the Jobbik party in Hungary, or any of the nationalistic movements in other European countries, whatâ€™s become clear is that people, particularly young people, have no fear or concerns about the lessons learned in World War II. This is what Generational Dynamics tells us always happens. In the last century, there were two world wars that destroyed Europe. The first World War was also devastating for Russia and the Mideast, while the second World War was also devastating for Japan and the Pacific. However, there were other massive wars in the last century, in Asia, in Africa, in the Americas. These wars of the last century are not well remembered by Americans, since Americans were not as heavily involved, but theyâ€™re well remembered by the people of the countries that fought in them. And that is just the last century. If you look at the earlier centuries  â€”   the 1800s, the 1700s, the 1600s, the 1500s, and so forth  â€”   there were also massive wars in Asia, Europe, the Mideast, Africa and the Americas in those centuries as well. No century has ever escaped this. The point is that these huge, massive wars have not yet begun to occur in this century, and so people, especially young people, have come to believe that they never will. And yet, there is absolutely no hope of avoiding them. Anyone can see that the world has become increasingly unstable in the last 10 or 15 years and that countries around the world have become increasingly nationalistic and xenophobic. Itâ€™s like the world is a pressure cooker, ready to explode. France enjoyed â€œLa Belle Ã‰poqueâ€ starting in 1871, with advances in the arts rather than wars. That was the â€œOld World Orderâ€ that Hannah Arendt was talking about in the quote above. And yet, World War I exploded in 1914 completely without warning, when a high school student decided to shoot an Archduke of another country. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, Hannah Arendt was right  â€”   that powerlessness is the major experience of our lives. Politicians are powerless to stop the flow of generations, as young, foolish generations displace older, traumatized, experienced generations, and repeat all the mistakes of the past, once again, over and over.

21193,Why FBI Director James Comey did the wrong thing ... again,nan,"License DMCA 
The New York Times headline article sums up Comey's dilemma aptly enough. 
""Mr. Comey could immediately inform Congress about the emails, which were found in an investigation into former Representative Anthony D. Weiner. That unusual step, months after Mr. Comey had cleared Mrs. Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing in the email case, would risk accusations that he was unfairly harming her presidential campaign less than two weeks before the election. 
""Or he could delay any announcement and examine the new emails more closely, risking criticism that he had suppressed important new information if it came out after the election, despite his pledges of ""transparency"" in the investigation."" 
And with that, the choice should have been obvious -- Comey shouldn't have made any announcement. There shouldn't have been a decision to make. - Advertisement - 
That there was even a choice in Comey's mind comes back to the same thing that's caused the FBI Director to err at every single stage of this investigation. It's not that ""Jim Comey is an apolitical straight shooter,"" as every talking head is eager to tell you. It's that Jim Comey is very concerned that he be seen as an apolitical straight shooter. Because of that, he has, repeatedly, put preservation of his own reputation ahead of both justice and the good of the nation. 
From his ludicrous, finger-wagging press gaggle in announcing Clinton's innocence, to his ham-fisted intrusion into the final act of the election, Comey has felt compelled to insert Jim Comey, straight-shooter, into every moment. 
As a result he's caused serious harm to the FBI, to the election, and to the nation. And, just incidentally, he's ruined his reputation in the process. 
Across the nation, prosecuting attorneys are not exactly the most modest or retiring of public servants. It's a position of unique power, and often engages the most vaunting egos. And yet, Comey has managed to shock those people whose responsibilities are most like his own. 
""'It is not the function of the FBI director to be making public pronouncements about an investigation, never mind about an investigation based on evidence that he acknowledges may not be significant,' [former assistant U.S. attorney] Akerman added. 'The job of the FBI is simply to investigate and to provide the results of its investigation to the prosecutorial arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. His job is not to give a running commentary about any investigation or his opinion about any investigation. This is particularly egregious since Secretary Clinton has no way to respond to what amounts to nebulous and speculative innuendo.'"" - Advertisement - 
It's not enough for Comey to do his job. He wants to be seen doing his job. He worries about the eyes of history, the verdict of time. Which is exactly where, and why, Comey failed. 
Doing the right thing means doing what you believe is proper even if the verdict of history comes against you. It means being willing to be seen as biased, or not transparent, or simply wrong. Doing the right thing risks finding that what you did was actually wrong. You must act on what you know, and do the best regardless. 
But Comey was more concerned that he be seen as doing the right thing. And that's ... a completely different thing. 
In essence, James Comey set his ego above the good of the country. That's not illegal, but it's certainly not right."
21194,Schumer: Democrats Will Attempt to Filibuster Gorsuch,Ken Klukowski,"WASHINGTON â€”  Senate Democrats will attempt to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) announced on Thursday during a speech on the Senate floor. [This is the fourth day of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Gorsuch, who currently serves on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Although the more liberal members of the committee tried to provoke Gorsuch, the Colorado judge remained poised and disciplined during his testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday, avoiding any missteps.  That part of the hearing process is now over, and senators are now listening to witnesses for and against the nomination. Gorsuch appears to continue headed toward a successful confirmation in the   Senate. But today Schumer criticized what he called Gorsuchâ€™s â€œlack of candor and desire to answerâ€ questions before the committee. He then announced, â€œAfter careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuchâ€™s nomination to the Supreme Court. â€ While it only takes a simple majority of 51 votes in the   Senate to confirm a nominee, Schumer then went on to say that Gorsuch â€œwill have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. â€ This means a filibuster. Under Senate Rule 22, for any question involving debate, if senators wish to continue speaking, it takes a   vote of the full Senate (60 out of 100) to invoke a motion for cloture, which limits debate to no more than 30 additional hours, after which a final vote must be held. When senators insist on continuing debate until cloture shuts them down, itâ€™s called a filibuster. Filibusters have historically been for legislative debates only, not judicial nominations. The first time in American history that a filibuster was used to stop any judicial nomination was 2003, when Senate Democrats filibustered President George W. Bushâ€™s nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, followed soon thereafter by other Bush judicial nominees. The only previous filibuster attempt ever made over a judge was in 1968 against the nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to become chief justice and replace Earl Warren. However, a majority of senators went on record saying they would vote against Fortas in any event, so it was not the filibuster that stopped Fortas. It was instead lacking enough votes to confirm him. For Estrada, by contrast, a majority of the Senate went on record supporting his confirmation, so it was the   threshold for cloture obstructing an    vote that defeated his nomination. The architect of the   strategy of using a filibuster to block an    vote on judicial nominations was none other than Schumer, who at the time had only been in the Senate for less than five years, and was not in a leadership position. In November 2014,   Leader Harry Reid ( ) reinterpreted the rules of the Senate so that the filibuster could not be used on any presidential nominations except the Supreme Court, clearing the way for Democrats to confirm several nominations that Republicans had blocked. This tactic has been called the â€œconstitutional optionâ€ by some, and the â€œnuclear optionâ€ by others. With Schumerâ€™s announcement that he will lead a filibuster of Gorsuchâ€™s nomination, Republicans must either pick up eight Democrats to join Republicans in voting for cloture, or Republicans must hold together at least 50 of their 52 members (with Vice President Mike Pence as a  ) to extend the constitutional option to Supreme Court nominations. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Gorsuch out of committee on April 3, sending the nomination to the Senate floor for this filibuster showdown.

21196,The Genocide of Indigenous Peoples in North America and Palestine-Israel - American Herald Tribune,Prof. Tony Hall,"Prof. Tony Hall Speaks Out on Mohawk Territory 2 Shares
1 0 0 1
Prof. Hall speaks at the Haldimand Deed Recognition Dinner at Kanata in the Mohawk Village near Brantford Ontario. Prof. Hall has been the target of a witch hunt mounted by Facebook and by B'nai Brith Canada. The mission of the Canadian branch of the Anti-Defamation League is to provide Zionist advocacy for ""the security of Israel.""
In late August of 2016 a maliciously engineered smear item was placed on Prof. Hall's FB page without his knowledge or consent. The B'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to ""Kill All Jews."" The B'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall's academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982.
The University of Lethbridge's administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel's genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever.
The attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning. The University of Lethbridge Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have identified the illegal nature of Dr. Mahon's unprecedented assault on the core principles of tenure and academic freedom.
In his talk sponsored by the Mohawks of the Grand River, Dr. Hall put the Zionist/Facebook campaign directed at disabling critics of Israel in a broader historical context. The assault on the Palestinian people extends the genocidal holocaust directed at the Indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1492. Israeli techniques directed at terminating the Palestinian presence draw on the genocidal techniques directed at Native Americans in the expansionary course of US history.

21197,"On Same Day Massive Layoffs Begin, ESPNW Celebrates Black Power Icon and Fugitive Cop Killer - Breitbart",Warner Todd Huston,"Proving that it has not learned that its customers tire of   politics forced into sports reporting, on the same day that sports cable network ESPN fired 100   employees and reporters, ESPN Women devoted its webpages to extreme   social justice, resistance, and feminism. [Indeed, ESPNW used a claimed â€œhonoringâ€ of National Poetry Month as an excuse to â€œreflect on resistance, redefining feminism and movement. â€  What followed were poems from five professors, writers, and activists filled with revolution, resistance,   and race baiting. The first piece, penned by Dr. DaMaris B. Hill, a professor of African American and Africana Studies at the University of Kentucky, is titled simply â€œRevolution. â€ It celebrates the violence and force of revolution, and is specifically dedicated to black power icon Asatta Shakur, who murdered a police officer in 1977. In 1979 Shakur escaped from prison and sought asylum in Cuba, where she remains to this day. Shakur was also the first woman named to the FBIâ€™s Most Wanted Terrorist List, and there is currently a $1 million reward leading to her arrest. Amusingly, Dr. Hill seems to admit that the liberals â€œrevolutionâ€ has nothing to do with â€œfactsâ€ by writing, â€œRevolution ainâ€™t got sh â€”   to do with facts. It is all faith!â€ That sounds about right, since liberals have no facts or truth on hand with their â€œrevolution. â€ Itâ€™s all just a religion  â€”   or a replacement thereof  â€”   to them. After Dr. Hill, ESPNW moved on to a piece titled, â€œWhat Leaps from a Stormâ€™s Throat,â€ by   of Staten Island professor Patricia Smith. This second poem contains a line that slams capitalism, reading, â€œbeneath vendors who heartlessly hawk the stupid slap of sugar, spirit and salt. â€ Next, Wisconsin writer Carrie Ann Welshâ€™s â€œStart Here,â€ seemed to posit that only minority women play sports, with a line saying, â€œTheir bodies are too dark, too wiry, too big, too fast. â€ Finally, New York arts and culture administrator DÃ©Lana R. A. Dameron, made her entire piece about whites oppressing blacks. In Dameronâ€™s poem, entitled â€œMy Struggle with Feminism is Black,â€ black women are presented as having no freedom. Daeron insists black women are â€œin the service of white folks. â€ Dameron even poked her poetic finger in the eyes of liberal, white women who think they support the liberation of black women by noting that   white women found it easy to stomp around advocating for free black women when black women werenâ€™t teachers or even living in the same neighborhoods as those white women. â€œDonâ€™t let those white girls turn you into a mammy. You are not there to take care of them, get yours,â€ Dameronâ€™s screed said. So, as these â€œpoetsâ€ are pushing   race hatred, and resistance, ESPN is once again seen pushing far left,   liberalism onto its sports fans. Will they ever learn?

21198,Never the Noodles Shall Meet: A Chinese Treaty Is Tested - The New York Times,Emily Feng,"Amid the modern skyscrapers of Shanghai, the parties to a   treaty are at war. At stake are the spoils of a   industry and a minority groupâ€™s ability to retain its customs in a   China. Also, noodles. When Xian Gulin opened a halal restaurant in Shanghai last month that serves   beef noodles, he hoped patrons would line up at his door. What he got instead was an entrance blocked for weeks by protesters. The protesters, like Mr. Xian, were Hui, a Muslim ethnic minority, originally from Chinaâ€™s northwest. They accused the restaurateur of violating the    Treaty, a social pact that prohibits the Hui from opening halal noodle shops within 400 meters of each other  â€”   roughly 1, 300 feet. To appease the protesters, Mr. Xian eventually agreed to take down the halal insignia from his storefront. The origins of the treaty are unknown, but restaurateurs say it originally capped the number of noodle shops in a Hui village at one. As more Hui began moving eastward into Chinaâ€™s growing coastal cities, they brought a variant of the treaty with them. â€œFor the Hui as a community, maintaining their halal traditions and restaurants has been critical to their survival, so itâ€™s not surprising that in a highly capitalized society, these rivalries would bubble to the surface,â€ said Dru Gladney, an anthropology professor at Pomona College in California and an expert on Chinese ethnic minorities. The halal food industry has flourished in China as the country has pursued closer economic relations with   Middle Eastern nations. In Qinghai Province alone, sales of halal food products in 2014 totaled about $2. 8 billion. On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, online commenters condemned the protests. Even the Islamic Association of Qinghai got involved, declaring the boycott of Mr. Xianâ€™s restaurant a violation of â€œfair competitionâ€ that caused â€œsocial instability. â€ Still, Hui restaurateurs insist that the treaty is more necessary than ever. â€œWe worked so hard to climb our way up, so we canâ€™t tolerate people who do not respect the treaty,â€ said Ma Yi Buo La, 37, who owns a halal noodle shop in Shanghai. â€œPeople who donâ€™t abide by the treaty, theyâ€™re not good people,â€ he said. Yet enforcement of the treaty is increasingly difficult as halal cuisine becomes more popular across China. â€œIt was a tradition in our villages back home, but I donâ€™t think anyone really respects this treaty anymore in large cities,â€ said Ma Kefu, 19, a Gansu native who now works at a halal restaurant in Beijing. To make his point, he gestured across the street. No more than 15 feet away stood another halal restaurant, its intricate halal insignia prominently on display."

21200,Trumpâ€™s Shift on Russia Brings Geopolitical Whiplash - The New York Times,Peter Baker,"WASHINGTON  â€”   A week ago, President Trump was accused of being a tool for the Russians, an unwitting agent of influence, so full of admiration that he defended President Vladimir V. Putin against critics who called him a killer. Now, Mr. Trump is in a diplomatic clash with Mr. Putinâ€™s Russia, his administration accusing Moscow of trying to cover up a Syrian chemical weapons attack on civilians and his secretary of state delivering    ultimatums. Even in a presidency marked by unpredictability, the   shift from coziness to confrontation has left Washington and other capitals with a case of geopolitical whiplash. The prospects of improving   relations were already slim given the atmosphere of suspicion stemming from Kremlin meddling in last yearâ€™s election, but the dÃ©tente once envisioned by Mr. Trump has instead deteriorated into the latest cold war. For Mr. Trumpâ€™s camp, the abrupt turnaround simply proved how false the conspiracy narrative was from the start. â€œIf there was anything that Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie,â€ said Eric Trump, the presidentâ€™s son. For some critics, it seemed to be a cynical way of distracting attention from the multiple investigations into possible contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russia even as Moscow was trying to help Mr. Trump win the presidency. Either way, it suggested that the relationship between the two powers could be volatile in the months to come, subject to the impulsive reactions of a president with no prior experience in foreign policy, the often strident responses of a Russian leader given to his own moments of pique and the clashing national interests of both countries in key areas around the world. â€œI was skeptical from the beginning that it would be possible for the United States and Russia, after all that happened in the last few years, to engage in a successful reset,â€ said Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer on Russia now at Georgetown University. â€œWhatâ€™s surprising is how quickly we returned to the status quo ante we had at the end of the Obama administration. â€ John R. Beyrle, a former ambassador to Moscow, said the extremes of the relationship were being exaggerated and it would probably settle back into the middle. â€œLevels of trust have deteriorated so much that these initial meetings will produce little in the way of agreements and the investigations into likely Russian interference in the election cast a huge shadow that both sides need to acknowledge,â€ he said. Mr. Trump is the fourth president in a row who came into office determined to reboot the relationship with Moscow, an ambition that often eluded the other three. The difference is that the hacking of Democratic email during last yearâ€™s election, for which intelligence agencies blamed Russia, made Mr. Trumpâ€™s embrace of Mr. Putin politically problematic. His willingness to overlook Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea, its armed intervention in eastern Ukraine and, until now, its support for President Bashar  â€™s government in Syria mystified many experts. He called Mr. Putin â€œa stronger leaderâ€ than President Barack Obama, praised him for â€œdoing a great jobâ€ and expressed hope that he would be â€œmy new best friend. â€ Michael Morell, a former acting C. I. A. director, wrote last fall that Mr. Trump seemed to be an â€œunwitting agent of influenceâ€ for Moscow. By Tuesday, after Mr. Trump ordered a missile strike against Syria in retaliation for using chemical weapons on its own people, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson arrived in Moscow with a harsh warning that Russia had better give up its support of Mr. Assad. He was greeted with a cold shoulder, denied a meeting with Mr. Putin as no secretary of state has been on a first visit to Moscow going back to the days of Cordell Hull in World War II. Back in Washington, the White House held a briefing accusing Russia of shielding Syriaâ€™s chemical weapons attack on civilians. The Russians have responded with harsh language of their own. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin compared Mr. Trumpâ€™s action in Syria to President George W. Bushâ€™s invasion of Iraq in 2003. And Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev suggested that Mr. Trump has turned out not to be what he presented himself to be during last yearâ€™s campaign. â€œThatâ€™s it,â€ he wrote on Facebook last week. â€œThe last remaining election fog has lifted. â€ In the end, he said, Mr. Trump was â€œbroken by the existing power machineâ€ in Washington. Mr. Morell said on Tuesday that despite calling Mr. Trump a virtual Russian agent, he always believed Russian behavior would lead to a parting of the ways. â€œThis seems to be happening now,â€ he said. But he noted that Mr. Trump has left it to Mr. Tillerson and others rather than speaking out himself. â€œHe needs to do that, and he needs to be critical of the large number of other aggressive actions that Putin has undertaken over the past two years,â€ Mr. Morell said. Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign last year, said the shift in tone in recent days did not mean there was not collusion during the election. â€œEverything we believed happened in the election could be true  â€”   Putin wanted him to be president and the administration took the action it took last week,â€ she said. â€œIt could all be part of the master ruse  â€”   or Putin could be upset about it. â€ Either way, she said, â€œThereâ€™s no evidence that it changes anything I think happened in the election or that Democrats should back off investigations. And moreover, itâ€™s really weird that he himself hasnâ€™t said anything. â€ Mr. Trump will have the opportunity on Wednesday when he hosts NATOâ€™s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. European leaders will be listening to what Mr. Trump has to say, given that during the campaign he criticized NATO even as he praised Mr. Putin. Aides to Mr. Trump have been frustrated at the focus on the Russia investigations and the assumptions that the presidentâ€™s associates did something wrong even though several officials have said no evidence has emerged that proves collusion with Russia. They blame the media for creating a false narrative that they see as now disproved. How, they ask, could Mr. Trumpâ€™s team have made secret deals with Russia if his own secretary of state cannot even get a meeting? â€œItâ€™s interesting that we went from all of these direct links to Russia to now are we disappointed that we canâ€™t even get a meeting with him,â€ Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. â€œThere is a bit of irony in the question. â€ Eric Trump voiced that sentiment in an interview with Londonâ€™s Daily Telegraph published on Tuesday. The younger Mr. Trump said his father was influenced to retaliate against Syria for using chemical weapons on civilians in part by his sister Ivanka, who was â€œheartbroken and outragedâ€ by the atrocity. Even though some question the presidentâ€™s approach to Russia, Eric Trump said his father would not be â€œpushed aroundâ€ by Mr. Putin. â€œHe is not a guy who gets intimidated,â€ he said. The    over Russia left lawmakers trying to make sense of it. â€œIt speaks to the broader incoherence of this administrationâ€™s foreign policy,â€ said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. â€œThe change in rhetoric on Russia is  . Iâ€™m glad to see it and I hope it continues, but so far the only thing we know about this administrationâ€™s foreign policy is that it will probably change in a week or two. â€ But Mr. Murphy said the congressional intelligence committees still need to investigate what happened in last yearâ€™s election. If the shift in tone from the administration happened two months ago, he said, it might have undercut that determination. But since then, he said, more evidence has emerged. â€œThereâ€™s now some pretty important meat on the bones of this story,â€ he said. â€œThe imperative remains to get to the bottom of it. â€"

The remainder will need to pay $250 to gain entrance to the ESAâ€™s chaotic digital wonderland.  While E3 attendance has never been officially public, prior to 2007 the credentials needed for entry were relatively broad. 2007â€™s   restructuring attempted to curtail the growing crowd but culled much of the eventâ€™s excitement along with the vast majority of its attendees. This yearâ€™s expo looks to capture the   enthusiasm of eager consumers while taking reasonable precautions not to flood the show floor to the point of obstruction. ESA Senior VP of Communications Rich Taylor called it â€œa strategic decisionâ€ for â€œa changing industry,â€ made possible â€œthanks to our members and their vision and leadership. â€ According to Taylor, theyâ€™ve been listening: The feedback we heard was clear â€”  they wanted to play the games inside the convention center.

21202,Iran Accuses Thomson Reuters Charity Official of Sedition - The New York Times,Thomas Erdbrink,"TEHRAN  â€”   A   employee of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, arrested in Iran more than two months ago for unexplained reasons, has been accused of plotting to overthrow the government, Iranian news media reported Wednesday. The detainee, Nazanin   37, is a program coordinator for the foundation, the independent charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news agency. Both the foundation and Ms.  â€™s British husband, Richard Ratcliffe, denied the accusations. Ms.   was arrested on April 3 in Tehran and taken to the provincial city of Kerman in southern Iran, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps provided to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Her    daughter, Gabriella, who had accompanied her to Iran for a visit with family, is staying with maternal grandparents. The childâ€™s passport was confiscated by the Iranian authorities, severely complicating any possibility of reuniting her with Mr. Ratcliffe. â€œThe British national, Nazanin Zaghari, who was arrested by the intelligence department of the Sarallah Corps of Kerman, has participated in coup plots,â€ the Revolutionary Guards statement read. â€œThrough membership in foreign companies and institutions, she has participated in designing and executing media and cyberplots with the aim of the peaceful overthrow of the Islamic Republic establishment. â€ The statement also accused Ms.   of being â€œone of the chief members of networks of adversary institutions, who  â€”   with the direction and support of foreign media and espionage services  â€”   has committed her criminal acts over the past few years. â€ Mr. Ratcliffe was quoted by Reuters as calling the accusations against his wife â€œpreposterousâ€ charges that appeared to be a political case. He has been outspoken in calling for her release and started an online petition that now has more than 764, 000 signatures. The Revolutionary Guards statement seemed directed at the Thomson Reuters company, a global media powerhouse regarded with suspicion and hostility in Iran because of its British foundations. Reuters merged with Canadaâ€™s Thomson company in 2008. â€œThe media corporations of hegemonic governments, especially the   British media, have made their best efforts in the recent months to support her in order to weaken the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corpsâ€™ determination but this false hope will never come true,â€ the statement added. In 2012 Thomson Reutersâ€™ press accreditation was suspended in Iran after the news agency was accused of having lied in a video report that asserted Iranian housewives were training to become ninja assassins. (A misleading headline in the report was corrected.) The suspended accreditation followed the closing of the British Embassy in Tehran after it had been attacked by   protesters. The government of President Hassan Rouhani has reportedly been in discussions to allow a Thomson Reuters bureau to reopen.   are opposed to what they view as increased influence by Westerners. Ms.   has never worked inside Iran, according to a statement released on Wednesday by the Thomson Reuters Foundation chief executive, Monique Villa. â€œNazanin has been working at the Thomson Reuters Foundation for the past four years as a project coordinator in charge of grants applications and training, and had no dealing with Iran in her professional capacity,â€ the statement said. â€œThe Thomson Reuters Foundation has no dealings with Iran whatsoever, does not operate and does not plan to operate in the country. â€ The intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards has arrested several dual citizens over recent months. The latest such arrest was last week, when a   professor researching women, Homa Hoodfar, was arrested on undisclosed charges. The semiofficial Mashregh news organization reported Wednesday that she was accused of collaborating with two organizations that â€œare working to diminish religiosity and equal gender rights. â€ Mashregh criticized the two organizations, Women Living Under Muslim Laws, and Hivos, a human rights advocacy group based in The Hague, for â€œemphasizing womenâ€™s control of their own bodies and choosing to live single. â€"
21203,Feds Establish Support Program for Victims of Criminal Aliens,Bob Price,"Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly ordered the director of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to create a program to assist the victims of crimes committed by illegal aliens. The program creates a liaison and authorizes the disclosure of suspect immigration statuses and other pertinent data. [Secretary Kelly ordered the creation of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office to help reverse policies of the previous administration that kept certain information about criminal aliens the victims of their crimes.  â€œCriminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents,â€ Kelly wrote in a   memo obtained by Breitbart Texas. â€œOften, these victims are not provided adequate information about the offender, the offenderâ€™s immigration status, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender. â€ I am establishing the [VOICE] Office within the Office of the Director of ICE, which will create a programmatic liaison between ICE and the known victims of crimes committed by removable aliens,â€ the secretary explained. â€œThe liaison will facilitate engagement with the victims and their families to ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that they are provided information about the offender, including the offenderâ€™s immigration status and custody status, and that their questions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement efforts are addressed. â€ Kelly ordered the acting ICE director to immediately reallocate any and all resources that were previously allocated to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens to now be used to support VOICE. He ordered the immediate termination of any outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens. The memo supporting President Donald Trumpâ€™s â€œEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United Statesâ€ Executive Order also included the authorization to hire an additional 10, 000 ICE agents and enforcement officers to help in the massive task of rounding up criminal aliens before they can commit further crimes, Breitbart Texas reported. The 680 illegal aliens rounded up in the latest targeted enforcement operation carried out earlier this month represents a tiny fraction of the criminal aliens present in the U. S. according to DHS estimates. A December study by the Center for Immigration Studies estimated there are 820, 000 criminal illegal aliens in the U. S. not deported by the Obama Administration. Courts had convicted many of these aliens for crimes including murder, rape, drug offenses, other crimes, or who had final orders of removal from an immigration judge that was not enforced, Breitbart News reported. Often, the mainstream media refuse to include information about the immigration status of a criminal alien â€”  even after other outlets research and release said information. An example is a Mexican national illegally present in the United States that killed a Houston, Texas, pastor and his wife while he was engaged in street racing. All local media outlets referred to the criminal alien in vague and misleading terms like â€œHouston man,â€ or â€œa man,â€ Breitbart Texas reported. The omitted information continued to spread despite previous coverage by Breitbart Texas of the case revealing the Mexican nationalâ€™s illegal immigrant status seven months earlier. The order from Secretary Kelly to provide additional information and resources to victims of illegal alien crime is effective immediately.

The owner of the club, Jonathan Paiz, said Brodie got his nickname because he would â€œcrushâ€ it when at bat. â€œBasically he would get up there and hit the ball hard,â€ Mr. Paiz said in a telephone interview. Brodie and his father, Sean Copeland, 51, were two of the victims of the attack, which killed at least 82 others, including nine other children and teenagers, and wounded 202 people. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, noting that the attack occurred less than a year after the attacks in and around Paris, said that for the second time in nine months, the French flag was being flown over the Texas Governorâ€™s Mansion in remembrance. â€œWhile every heinous attack like this is tragic,â€ he said in a statement, â€œthis latest one hits close to home. â€ The Copelands were the only two Americans who had been confirmed dead as of Friday night. Three students from the University of California, Berkeley, were among the wounded, according to a statement issued Friday by the university. Two of the students, Vladyslav Kostiuk, 23, and Diane Huang, 20, were discharged after medical treatment and returned to their summer dormitories in Nice, the university said. Daryus Medora, 21, whose leg was broken, remained in the hospital. A fourth student, Nicolas Leslie, 20, was unaccounted for on Friday. They were among 85 students who were on a study abroad program with the university. The Copeland family lives in Lakeway, Tex. near Austin. They were on a vacation that began in Pamplona and Barcelona, Spain, before moving on to southern France. Mr. Copeland was traveling with his wife, Kim, whose 40th birthday celebration on Monday was part of the reason they went on the trip. In addition to Brodie, Mr. Copelandâ€™s other children, his son Austin, 22, and daughter, Maegan, 29, from a previous marriage accompanied them, said Jess Davis, a family representative. On Friday in Lakeway, an affluent Hill Country community, many neighbors of the Copelands were stunned that an act of violence in Europe could reach thousands of miles across the Atlantic to invade their peaceful town. â€œItâ€™s heartbreaking for everybody,â€ said Dianne Wood, who lives a few houses up the street from the Copelands and knows the family well. â€œThe Copelands are a sweet family, and we just want to respect their privacy. â€ She described Brodie Copeland as â€œan incredible boy  â€”   so much life, so much personality. â€ Coleen Serfoss, Brodieâ€™s   teacher, remembered him as a â€œsuperstarâ€ who stood out in class, on the baseball field and on stage. He aspired to become an actor and had performed in   productions of â€œCinderellaâ€ and â€œPeter Pan. â€ He was also in the schoolâ€™s honor choir. As they said their goodbyes on the last day of class, Ms. Serfoss recalled, she told Brodie, â€œWhen you get your Academy Award, I hope you remember me. â€ Her principal called her Thursday night to tell her that Brodie had died. â€œWhen I woke up, I was hoping it was a dream until I turned the TV on,â€ she said at a news conference outside Lakeway Elementary School. Grief over Brodieâ€™s death was palpable among Lakeway teachers. â€œHe was just a very sweet, kind young man,â€ said Joy Crenshaw, a   teacher who often saw Brodie in the school cafeteria. â€œHe always had a smile on his face. â€ A tribute to the father and son was set up on the Facebook page of the Hill Country team, where Brodie had been playing baseball since 2014. It shows Brodie frolicking in the French Riviera waters. â€œImmediately, he made an impact on all of the coaches at HC,â€ said a   page set up by Mr. Paiz, the baseball clubâ€™s owner.

21206,Trump to Host Passover Seder in Washington on Monday Night,Breitbart Jerusalem,"The Times of Israel reports: WASHINGTON  â€”   US President Donald Trump will host a White House Passover seder Monday night, an administration official told The Times of Israel on Sunday, confirming that the new administration will continue a tradition started by former president Barack Obama. [Aside from the president, who is expected to attend, it is not yet clear which members of the administration will participate in the dinner, including Trumpâ€™s Jewish    Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. The White House Seder began as an annual tradition under former president Barack Obama, who hosted the first such event in 2009, in the Old Family Dining Room.  News that the Trump administration had planned to carry on the custom was first reported by Jewish Insider.

21207,"More beer, less vodka as Russians mull ongoing crisis","Gazeta.ru, Rustem Falyakhov","vodka , beer , russians Visitors at the bar ""Aist"" (Stork) on Lubyansky Proyezd in Moscow Source:Alexey Kudenko / RIA Novosti 
The volume of retail trade turnover in Russia continues to decrease. In August, it fell by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, compared to January-August last year, when it fell by 5.7 per cent, said analysts from the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA). They were citing data from the state statistical agency Rosstat and a survey conducted by the Institute for Social Analysis and Forecasting. 
The turnover is decreasing because Russians are not only eating less and cutting back on spending on services, but they are also drinking fewer alcoholic beverages. Sales of vodka dropped catastrophicallyâ€™ 
From January to August 2016, vodka, liqueurs and brandies accounted for 42 percent of sales volume. Beer amounted to 44-45 percent of total sales of alcohol. Another 12-13 percent was wine production. 
Other beverages (cider, mead, etc.) made up less than 1 percent of alcohol products bought by people, according to RANEPA's monitoring data. 
Whiskey or vodka: Which drink will dominate? 
The range of sales is clearly seasonal. Retailers usually sell more wine, champagne and vodka in December while sales of beer increase by 15-20 percent in mid-summer compared to the beginning of the year. 
""Retail sales of alcohol have significantly decreased over the past two years. 10.6 percent fewer alcoholic beverages were sold between January and August this year than during the same eight months of 2014,"" the survey report stated. Retail sales of alcoholic beverages bottomed out in January and April 2016. 
""Sales of vodka have dropped catastrophically,"" Alexandra Burdyak, a senior researcher at RANEPA and one of the authors of the study, said. ""The drop was 13.4 percent against the same period of last year. The main decline occurred last year, when sales of vodka decreased by 12.6 percent compared to 2014."" 
However, the wine production sector showed a different trend. The traditional New Year increase in sales of wine and champagne dragged on, with wine sales remaining at 2015 levels until May 2016. 
Burdyak said consumers first finished their earlier stored wine and then, as stocks in cabinets dried out, and lovers of wine and sparkling wines made sure that nothing was happening in the economy, the ruble was not strengthening and the prices of imported alcohol were not decreasing, they began to buy this type of alcohol again. The new generation of consumers 
According to Burdyak, the decrease in consumption of vodka and other alcoholic beverages has been steady since 2013. Strong alcohol consumption peaked in 2007, and it has been in decline since then. 
The taste of Russians, born in 1985 and later, has been shaped by western, primarily European influences; they prefer wine, beer and other light alcoholic beverages. 
However, Vadim Drobiz, director of the Centre for Federal and Regional Alcohol Market Studies (TSIFRRA), believes it is a little too early to talk about a reduction in alcohol consumption in Russia. 
""Because of the crisis, the main consumers of alcoholic drinks could have switched to cheaper options, this is possible,"" he said. ""But few people are capable of seriously saving on alcohol."" 
Despite falling production, vodka consumption increasing in Russia Drinking away the crisis 
Vodka consumption fell from 53 percent of retail sales, measured in terms of absolute alcohol content, in 2007-2009 to 39 percent in 2015. During the same period, the share of beer increased from 31-32 percent to 43 percent of total sales of alcoholic beverages. 
The total volume of retail sales is calculated in terms of absolute alcohol content as follows: Half a litre of vodka (40 percent alcohol) is equal to 200 grams of ethanol; one litre of beer (4 percent) is equivalent to 40 grams, and one litre of wine (12 percent) contains 120 grams of ethanol. 
These trends appear likely to continue over the next few years, though some analysts have reservations. 
""It should be borne in mind that consumers, and the Russians certainly in my experience, consider strong alcohol to be an antidepressant,"" Drobiz said. ""And that means that consumption of vodka and other spirits in the context of the ongoing economic crisis is not likely to fall.""

The Groton police said officers found Mr. Geils in the late afternoon after they were asked to check on him.

Geils Band was formed in the   as Snoopy and the Sopwith Camels, while Mr. Geils was attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, according to the bandâ€™s Facebook page. It switched focus in 1967, recruiting the energetic frontman and lead singer Peter Wolf and becoming the J. Geils Blues Band, an acoustic trio that later turned more toward rock and dropped the â€œbluesâ€ from its name as it added members. The band spent years establishing roots in the Boston area through live shows before signing with Atlantic Records in 1970. That year it released its debut album, titled simply â€œThe J. Geils Band,â€ to modest acclaim. A   in 1971, â€œThe Morning After,â€ helped push the group to the national stage as its sound developed. Adding bouncy synthesized pop to its blues roots, the band became a major commercial success with the hit single â€œLove Stinks,â€ from a 1980 album of the same name. The groupâ€™s 1981 album, â€œâ€ yielded two more hit singles as the group leaned further into the increasingly digital   of the era. â€œI founded the band as a   blues band, and it evolved into a bluesy rock band,â€ Mr. Geils said in a 2015 interview with the website Best Classic Bands. â€œI donâ€™t care what any recording artist says they all want a No. 1 gold single, and we have two. â€ â€œCenterfoldâ€ spent six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, while â€œ â€ reached the No. 4 spot.

He wrote that Mr. Geilsâ€™s guitar playing combined â€œthe harmonic sophistication of a jazz player with a rockerâ€™s sensibility. â€ The group disbanded in 1985 but reunited in 1999 for a brief concert tour. It had since reunited periodically, once to perform at the opening concert for the new House of Blues in Boston in 2009 and the next year as the opening act for Aerosmith at Fenway Park. In recent years the band toured without Mr. Geils because of a legal dispute with his record label, which claimed ownership of the bandâ€™s name, according to the Facebook page. He quietly secured the trademark for the name in 2009, according to The Boston Globe. There was no immediate word on his survivors. He told The Globe in 2004 that he and his wife of 28 years, Kris, split up in 1999. John Warren Geils Jr. was born on Feb. 20, 1946, in New York City and grew up in Far Hills, N. J. His father was an engineer at Bell Labs and, Mr. Geils said, passed on his love of jazz to his son, taking him to see Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis perform. He played the trumpet in high school before switching to guitar. After graduation he attended Northeastern University before transferring to Worcester Polytech. An automobile enthusiast, Mr. Geils founded KTR Motorsports out of a garage in Carlisle, Mass. to service vintage Ferraris, Maseratis and other Italian cars. He sold the business in 1996."

His favored areas of study include state sponsored terrorism, media manufactured reality and the role of intelligence services in manipulation of populations and the perception of events. Trump rape accuser skips press conference, citing threats By Ian Greenhalgh on November 4, 2016 Woman known only as â€˜Jane Doeâ€™ alleges Republican presidential nominee sexually assaulted her when she was 13 Attorney Lisa Bloom announces the cancellation of a press conference for Trump accuser â€˜Jane Doeâ€™ in Woodland Hills, California, November 2, 2016. Trump rape accuser skips press conference, citing threats 
A woman who claims she was raped as a teenager by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump failed to show up for a Wednesday press conference during which she was to reveal her identity, citing threats against her. 
The woman, known in the media by the pseudonym Jane Doe, alleges Trump sexually assaulted her four times in 1994, when she was just 13, during parties organized by disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. 
In 2008 Epstein was sentenced to 13 months in prison for soliciting sex with an underage girl. 
Reporters packed into the office of Doeâ€™s lawyer in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, where she was expected to speak publicly about her allegations for the first time. However, her lawyer Lisa Bloom appeared alone and explained that the media event was canceled because her client feared for her safety. 
â€œJane Doe has received numerous threats today as have all the Trump accusers that I have represented,â€ Bloom said. â€œShe has decided she is too afraid to show her face. She has been here all day, ready to do it, but unfortunately she is in terrible fear. Weâ€™re going to have to reschedule. I apologize to all of you who came. I have nothing further.â€ 
Bloom, who has a court TV show and is a legal analyst for NBC News, is the daughter of Gloria Allred, a civil rights attorney representing three other women making claims against Trump. 
According to court papers, the woman claims she was offered money to attend the parties and that Trump, who knew her age to be just 13, initiated the sex. 
On the fourth occasion, Trump allegedly tied her to a bed, exposed himself, and then raped her despite her loud protestations. Trump, she claims, hit her in the face and told her he could do whatever he wanted. He then warned her that if she revealed the abuse, she and her family would be â€œphysically harmed if not killed.â€ She claims there are witnesses to the assaults and that Epstein also raped her. 
Trump, who has faced a recent series of claims by women alleging sexual assaults, has categorically denied Jane Doeâ€™s story as a fabrication, part of a smear campaign against him. 
On Wednesday Bloom tweeted that her firmâ€™s website and emails had been hacked, saying the hacker group Anonymous had taken responsibility. 
The UKâ€™s Guardian newspaper, which in recent months has been investigating the claims by Doe, reported that she first tried to file a complaint against Trump in April but the paperwork was dismissed due to filing errors. A second lawsuit was submitted in June in New York and California, and then apparently amended again in September. 
The newspaper noted that the claims have mostly been ignored by mainstream media because they â€œappeared to have been orchestrated by an eccentric anti-Trump campaigner with a record of making outlandish claims about celebrities,â€ referring to Norm Lubow, a former producer on the Jerry Springer television show. 
The Guardian said that in June it discovered a publicist known as â€œAl Taylorâ€ who tried to sell a videotape of Doe talking about her allegations for $1 million. Taylor, the report said, was linked to Lubow. 
However, when the Guardian contacted â€œAl Taylorâ€ to uncover his identity, he replied, â€œJust be warned, weâ€™ll sue you if we donâ€™t like what you write. Weâ€™ll sue your ass, own your ass and own your newspaperâ€™s ass as well, punk.â€ 
An initial status conference in Doeâ€™s civil lawsuit against Trump has been scheduled for December 16 in a New York district court, just over a month after the November 8 US presidential elections.

[Ubisoftâ€™s 3rd quarter was as much a mixed bag of victory and defeat. While winter sports sim Steep outperformed its relatively muted expectations,   simulator Watch Dogs 2 wasnâ€™t quite as â€œdynamicâ€ as the company expected with a â€œsoftâ€ launch. Still, it reportedly managed to outperform last yearâ€™s shaky Assassinâ€™s Creed: Syndicate launch.  While interest in MMO shooter The Division has dwindled since its blockbuster release, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot did report a 152% jump in active players since the gameâ€™s big October update. Meanwhile, tactical multiplayer shooter Rainbow Six: Siege is healthier than ever, with over 15 million registered players and the highest daily activity yet in a community that continues to expand. Moreover, back catalog games like the aforementioned The Division and Rainbow Six: Siege are driving profits further than usual. Ubisoftâ€™s continued support of their older titles is paying off, and the lack of a 2016 entry in the Assassinâ€™s Creed franchise seems to have boosted the sales of previous games in the series. Guillemot said that Ubisoft is â€œsuccessfully pursuing our transformation into a more recurring and more profitable profileâ€ and that â€œthe positive effects of this transformation are remarkable. â€ Finally, Ubisoft reported about $213 million for the Assassinâ€™s Creed movie, a â€œsolid first step. â€ While it didnâ€™t exactly wow the critics, gamers around the world seem to have enjoyed seeing the titular Assassins struggle against the machinations of Abstergoâ€™s Templars on the big screen. Ubisoft will be releasing the next major entry this year in the Assassinâ€™s Creed franchise and has delayed South Park: The Fractured But Hole into fiscal year 2017, which could help improve their fortunes over last year.

21212,Watch: Peter Schweizer Details How John Podesta May Have Violated Federal Law - Breitbart,Pam Key,"Tuesday on Fox News Channelâ€™s â€œFox  Friends,â€ Breitbart editor at large Peter Schweizer, the author of â€œClinton Cash,â€ detailed how the former chairman of Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign John Podesta may have violated federal law by failing to disclose stock shares he owned from a   company.  Schweizer said, â€œIn 2011, John Podesta joins the board of this very small energy company called Joule Energy based out of Massachusetts. About two months after he joins the board of a Russian entity called Rusnano, puts a billion rubles which is about    into John Podestaâ€™s company. Now, what is Rusnano? Itâ€™s not a private company, Steve. It is a fund directly funded by the Kremlin. In fact, the Russian science minister called Rusnano, Putinâ€™s child. So you have the Russian government investing in one John Podestaâ€™s businesses in 2011, while he is an advisor to Hillary Clinton at the State Department. â€ He continued, â€œSo then in 2013, he goes to the White House, to be a special counselor to Barack Obama, and that requires that you, you know, have financial disclosures every year. In his financial disclosure form in 2013, he not only fails to disclose these 75, 000 shares of stock that he has in Joule Energy which is funded in part by the Russian government. He also fails to disclose that he is on one of the three corporate board that this entity has. Itâ€™s got this very complex ownership structure. He discloses he is on the company in Massachusetts, that is he on the board of a company in the Netherlands, but he fails to disclose that he is also on the executive order of the holding company. Thatâ€™s a clear violation of the disclosure rules that needs to be looked at. â€ He added, â€œWhat makes the Podesta case clear is there was a transfer of money and there was a transfer of a lot of money that stood to make John Podesta a lot of money. That is unique and thatâ€™s extremely troubling because at the time that transfer is taking place he is advising Hillary Clinton at the State Department. We know that from the Podesta emails that he is helping her make personnel decisions, speech decisions, policy decisions. He is meeting with her monthly. Itâ€™s a transfer of money from a foreign government, at the time, that is he was advising Americaâ€™s chief diplomat, Hillary Clinton. â€ Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
21213,Marveling at the Soaking Wet Rockettes of the Olympics - The New York Times,Gia Kourlas,"Fred Astaire, as the famous saying goes, may have been a great dancer, but Ginger Rogers did everything he did  â€”   only backward and in high heels. At least she had gravity on her side. Synchronized swimmers often perform   and without air. Yes, they adamantly believe in the power of theater, as evidenced by their bejeweled bathing suits, gelatin   hair and   lipstick smiles, but theyâ€™re not just fooling around. Underwater for about   of each performance, synchronized swimmers require stamina, flexibility, endurance and, always, poise. They are Ginger Rogers, dancing in an   pool. Earlier this week at the Rio Olympics, synchronized swimming could be seen in the duet competition  â€”   the lithe Russians, Natalia Ishchenko and Svetlana Romashina, nabbed the gold. (The team event concluded Friday.) In both events, synchronized swimming continues to make a case for itself as a bewitching, if oddly    Olympic event. It falls between the cracks of sport and art in a delightful way. If synchronized swimming is viewed as a sport, it should be considered a sport of the soul, in which years of training lead to transcendence and performers mask effort at all times. Elegance of line isnâ€™t merely an ambition, itâ€™s a duty, as technique is wound into artistry and artistry feeds back into the technique. As for the choreography? It canâ€™t be a centimeter out of place. That virtuosity has been even more salient at these Olympic Games, where sports like gymnastics have so emphatically embraced acrobatic force over grace. In synchronized swimming, etherealness is captured in an extreme merging of agility and power. Synchro, as its known, became an Olympic sport in 1984 and was once referred to as water ballet. While it shares many of the same qualities as ballet  â€”   the hard training, pointed feet, a precise port de bras (or carriage of the arms) musicality and the constant striving for unattainable perfection  â€”   synchronized swimming is its own watery beast. A ballerinaâ€™s pointe shoe has something in common with water, the swimmerâ€™s medium. Each makes it possible for a performer to be ethereal each gives the illusion of floating. In water, swimmers can perform feats of technical bravura  â€”   lifting a partner without touching the bottom of a pool (thatâ€™s against the rules) or moving together as their legs, pointing out of the water, spin in tandem before disappearing beneath the surface. Of course, technique makes these dreamlike visions happen. In eggbeater kicks, also used in water polo, the legs alternate in clockwise and counterclockwise circles to keep the body upright different types of sculling  â€”   movements involving the hands and forearms to propel and stabilize  â€”   allow a swimmer to spin or stay afloat. Just as with ballet, itâ€™s not about isolated movements, but using the whole body, which is evident with underwater cameras that show synchronized swimmers from head to toe. Suddenly, it makes sense: The core of the body is a vessel, with the hands and legs spinning like propellers to keep it suspended in aqueous space. Itâ€™s tempting to want to watch synchro only in those shots that capture what is above and beneath the water. Sculling is gorgeous. But when two bodies sprout from the surface of the water, and you canâ€™t see whatâ€™s below, the effect is celestial. Again, it comes down to gravity. The challenges in ballet and synchronized swimming are daunting and, as a former ballet dancer and synchronized swimmer explained to me recently, equally difficult. Itâ€™s just that one involves defying gravity on land, and the other involves battling it to not sink in the water. (The key in both: abs, more abs, then even more abs.) In ballet, pain comes from impact with the floor in synchro, pain comes from thrusting up against the water. Since swimmers, like dancers, work so hard to hide their effort, it can be hard to see beyond the shiny package. But while the precision and insistence on glamour in synchronized swimming have much in common with the Rockettes or the work of a choreographer like Bob Fosse, with its   positions, synchro is neither   nor just full of girls playing dress up. In the water, where they are superhuman nymphs, artistry takes over. On land, they are women: sleek,   and modern. At the Olympics, synchronized swimming is an   sport, but in the rest of the world, men do it, too. There is a push to bring mixed pairs to the Olympics. Bill May, an American and one of the sportâ€™s most admired practitioners, won a gold medal in his technical duet with Christina Jones and a silver in the free duet with Kristina Lum Underwood at the 2015 FINA World Championships in Kazan, Russia. Mr. May, 37, said he hoped that by 2020 mixed duets would be included in the Olympics if so, he would try to be there. Synchronized swimmers donâ€™t age out as rapidly as athletes in other sports. â€œThere are so many different aspects of synchronized swimming that donâ€™t develop until later,â€ he said in an interview. â€œItâ€™s like dance. The more you do it, the more you become in tune with your body, with your emotions, with your movements. â€ The addition of a mixed duet would surely open the potential of choreography at the Olympics by allowing for a possibly more sensual meeting between partners at the moment, the   duets are a lot like watching doppelgÃ¤ngers  â€”   fascinating, yet limited. But there is at least one   pair to keep an eye on in 2020. This year for their free program,   Alexandri and Eirini Alexandri, from Austria  â€”   two sisters from a set of triplets  â€”   performed to â€œSwan Lake. â€ It was as if they had swallowed and spit out Tchaikovskyâ€™s score, leaving us to bask in its turmoil and thrills. They used their arms to distinction, crossing their wrists delicately as they floated briefly side by side and then, in a fury, pulling their arms out of the water like ferocious wings only to slap them back down again. They werenâ€™t just in the water they used it. They came in 12th out of 12, but I know a swan when I see one."
21214,Florida Gun Range Teaches 5-Year-Olds to Shoot,AWR Hawkins,"Jacksonville Clay Target Sports (JCTS) believes education is the key to stopping accidental shootings, so they are teaching kids as young as five gun safety and usage. [JCTS teaches â€œabout 50 children a day how to properly shoot and handle a gun. â€  According to First Coast News, Safety Officer Larry Freeman watches over JCTS. He said his dad taught him to use a gun at seven, adding, â€œHe taught me gun safety as a young one and Iâ€™ve carried that all through my life. â€ Freeman observed: You get rid of the mystique of the gun. That way, now they know what it can do, theyâ€™ve seen what it can do and theyâ€™ve been taught what it can do. And then theyâ€™ll know what to tell their parents if they find one, they wonâ€™t be sneaking it off to see how it works and wind up killing somebody. Jacksonville parent Tony Knight agrees with Freeman. He gave his son, Tony Knight Jr. his first gun at age three and says he still stands with Jr. when he shoots, placing his hand on his shoulder to give him support. Knight said he thinks following through â€”  continuing to teach safety and helping them use the gun â€”  is an important part of the learning process. He believes there is no magic age at which someone can begin learning. Rather, a child who can â€œlearn and listen and follow directionsâ€ is â€œready to be taught the gun. â€ Knightâ€™s son said, â€œPeople may use them wrong and I think thatâ€™s wrong. People should use them for hunting, shooting targets and other stuff, but not harming people. â€ He also noted that his father taught him to respect firearms, saying, â€œIt can hurt people, yeah dad taught me it can hurt people. â€ Jr. added, â€œIf I see a gun in my house Iâ€™m supposed to leave it alone and tell my parents and if theyâ€™re not home just leave it alone. â€ AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

21215,Ranks of Political Prisoners Grow as Democracy Ebbs in Venezuela - The New York Times,Nicholas Casey and Ana Vanessa Herrero,"For Braulio Jatar, it was the biggest scoop in years: Venezuelaâ€™s president was being chased by a crowd screaming of hunger, banging on pots and pans. The photos and video of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro soon appeared on Mr. Jatarâ€™s news site, Reporte Confidencial, and spread throughout the nation. The mob cornering Mr. Maduro was a shock in Venezuela  â€”   anger in food lines and even riots were a familiar sight, but no one had ever ambushed the president that way. Before he went to bed, Mr. Jatar fired off a series of Twitter messages, some alluding to witness testimony he would soon broadcast on his 9 a. m. radio show. But he never got the chance. He now sits locked in a jail cell, a political prisoner, rights activists say. Venezuela this week took its biggest plunge yet toward the   rule of Mr. Maduro as his loyalists on the Supreme Court gutted the countryâ€™s   legislature, seizing the powers of the only body seen as a counter to the presidentâ€™s growing authority. But the move was just part of a slide from democracy that has been gaining steady momentum in the country over the past year  â€”   seen starkly in prison cells where the ranks of political prisoners are growing. Those cells are filled with   opponents of Mr. Maduro, like a former mayor of a wealthy section of Caracas who was sentenced to more than 13 years on charges of inciting violence academics who have spoken out and journalists like Mr. Jatar, whose family says he was simply doing his job when he was detained in September. At least 114 political prisoners are behind bars in Venezuela, according to Penal Forum, a human rights organization that tracks political arrests in the country, a number that rose from 89 a year ago. The group says that since Mr. Maduro took power in 2013, the government has arrested 6, 893 people and jailed 433 for political reasons. â€œThe level of repression has risen to a brutal level,â€ said Alfredo Romero, who heads the group. â€œThe rise has come from the unpopularity of Maduro. â€ The situation has become urgent for Venezuelaâ€™s neighbors, 14 of whom wrote a rare joint statement last week calling on Venezuela to release the prisoners as a step toward restoring democratic norms. This week diplomats from the region met at the Organization of American States, a regional diplomacy group, to discuss steps to possibly expel the country from the group because of its political prisoners, among other accusations of violations of the blocâ€™s democratic charter. President Trump has also weighed in. In February, he posted on Twitter a photograph of himself and other officials in the Oval Office with Lilian Tintori, an opposition activist whose husband, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, was in jail. Mr. Trump wrote that Mr. LÃ³pez, a former mayor of Caracas, should be released immediately. The taking of political prisoners is not new in Venezuela it is the numbers that have grown under Mr. Maduro, human rights groups say. His predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, jailed opponents, including a judge who had opposed him. But analysts say Mr. ChÃ¡vez more often avoided dissent by channeling the countryâ€™s oil revenues, at times more than $100 a barrel, into social programs that bolstered his popularity. Mr. Maduro, however, has been faced with falling oil prices and years of economic mismanagement, which have led to shortages of food and basic medicines. Since October, Venezuelaâ€™s currency, the bolÃ­var, has been in free fall, with the   dollar rising against it by 350 percent at its height, putting food even further out of reach and sinking the presidentâ€™s popularity. These conditions led to the protests against Mr. Maduro on Margarita Island, where Mr. Jatar, the journalist, was arrested. His publication, Reporte Confidencial, had a long history of chronicling the ups and downs of the island  â€”   which is off Venezuelaâ€™s eastern coast  â€”   beginning as a weekly leaflet in 2006. It later expanded online, where it continued to operate on a shoestring budget and with a small staff. It became known for its investigations, including of improper land use by a judge and one about a state governor linked to a corruption scheme related to subsidized food. â€œIf no one else would publish it, Reporte Confidencial would put it out,â€ said Yusnelly Villalobos, Mr. Jatarâ€™s assistant. Mr. Jatarâ€™s wife, Silvia MartÃ­nez, said he was once threatened by the authorities when he sent reporters to cover antigovernment protests in 2014. The police raided their home and office, leaving with computer equipment. But that was no preparation for what would happen after the protestersâ€™ harassment of Mr. Maduro that night in September. The protest, which was soon known as news spread online by its hashtag, â€œ#cacerolazo,â€ or the â€œgreat pot banging,â€ was a deep embarrassment for Mr. Maduro. That week the opposition had amassed an estimated one million people in Caracas to protest food shortages and demand his ouster. The president had flown to Margarita Island for what was expected to be a positive reception in an area where he and Mr. ChÃ¡vez had both won in elections. After inaugurating a public housing complex, Mr. Maduro stopped his motorcade in the town of Villa Rosa, to walk among a crowd of what he thought were  . Instead they chased him through the streets. The next morning Mr. Jatar set off to a radio show, which he also ran, where he planned to continue his coverage of the nightâ€™s protest. â€œI turned on the dial to listen to him,â€ Ms. MartÃ­nez said. But he never showed up at the station he had been arrested by Venezuelan intelligence agents. In the next days, 30 more people were arrested in    roundups, according to Penal Forum. They were interrogated before being let go, the group said. But Mr. Jatar was not released. He sits in a jail cell in the state of Nueva Esparta on   charges involving $25, 000, which the authorities say they found in his car. Ms. MartÃ­nez says that the money was planted, and that Mr. Jatar would have never left such a large amount of money where it might have easily been stolen. â€œWe have no idea who ordered his detention,â€ Ms. Martinez said. JosÃ© Miguel Vivanco, the director of Human Rights Watch, which has also investigated the case, said his group concluded that the charges were fabricated in an effort to suppress journalists. â€œCalling for his release is not just about letting another political prisoner out of jail,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s about protecting free speech. â€ The government ombudsman did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Jatar or other prisoners. Venezuelaâ€™s military and prosecutorâ€™s office also did not respond to a written request for comment. Since Mr. Jatarâ€™s arrest, the government has intensified its focus on arresting those it deems subversive. In early January, Mr. Maduro put Tareck El Aissami, the newly appointed vice president, in charge of what he called the â€œanticoup squad,â€ a group aimed at punishing those plotting treason or other crimes against the state. On Jan. 12, Irwing Roca, a political activist, was leaving a meeting with Roniel Farias, a city councilman in Ciudad BolÃ­var, in the countryâ€™s eastern interior. Mr. Roca said that a black car was waiting outside for them, and that intelligence agents ordered them inside after taking their telephones. â€œAt no moment did they say why they had taken us,â€ Mr. Roca said. Mr. Roca said he was held by the agents for three days without food or water. Mr. Farias was released on March 14, with no explanation. The day before Mr. Roca and Mr. Farias were taken, Gilber Caro, a deputy legislator in the National Assembly for Voluntad Popular, an opposition party, was making his way down a highway outside of Caracas when his car was stopped by Venezuelan intelligence agents, his family said. Yeidi Caro, his sister, first learned of the news when a friend called to mistakenly say he was kidnapped. Mr. Caro initially thought he had been taken by criminals demanding a ransom. Ms. Caro saw the news of his arrest being broadcast. â€œI turned on the television and I saw that the government had him,â€ she said. The Venezuelan authorities said that they had found the legislator hiding an assault rifle and money to be used for attacks against the government. Officials broadcast a taped phone call between Mr. Caro and Ms. Tintori  â€”   the wife of the political prisoner photographed with Mr. Trump in February  â€”   in which they said the two had planned chaotic protests to undermine the government. â€œHe is a person with violent characteristics,â€ Mr. El Aissami, the vice president, said of Mr. Caro."
21216,Death Toll in Mistaken Bombing of Camp in Nigeria Climbs to 70 - The New York Times,Dionne Searcey,"DAKAR, Senegal  â€”   The number of people killed in an accidental military bombing at a Nigerian camp for displaced people has increased to 70, aid groups said on Wednesday, with at least nine of them humanitarian workers. The mistaken attack came after a military plane targeted an area crowded with people fleeing Boko Haram militants. Medical workers were scrambling on Wednesday to assemble equipment to treat dozens of severely injured people who were still awaiting evacuation from the camp in Rann, in northeastern Nigeria. At least 120 people were hurt in the errant strike on Tuesday by the Nigerian Air Force at the camp, which is near the Cameroon border and houses about 20, 000 people. Initial reports put the death toll around 50. Doctors Without Borders, a humanitarian aid group, said three employees of a Cameroonian firm that it hired to provide water and sanitation services in the camp were among the dead. Six local workers for the Nigerian Red Cross were also killed, and 13 others were hurt.   injured people were flown to hospitals in Maiduguri, Nigeria, the capital of Borno State. Among them were two young children: a    named Yaa Zara with a fractured arm and Kaka Hauwa, 5, whose neck was injured. One of the blasts was so forceful it knocked out two of Kakaâ€™s teeth, the childrenâ€™s mother, Fati Yasin, 35, said on Tuesday. She said she left her two children at their home in the camp to collect tickets for food distribution when she heard the loud buzz of a fighter jet overhead. â€œWe looked at it in the sky and before we knew it, it had dropped two bombs,â€ she said. The bomb struck around noon Tuesday, just as aid workers were vaccinating children in the camp for measles and screening them for malnutrition, according to a spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders. In the wake of the bombing, human rights groups were trying to assess how the military could have mistaken such a crowded camp for Boko Haram fighters. A terrorism and counterterrorism researcher for Human Rights Watch circulated on Twitter an aerial view of the encampment dotted with tents and other structures. It is situated near a Nigerian military post. The Nigerian military has been engaged in a fierce battle against Boko Haram, which has ties to the Islamic State, for years. Civilians have often borne the brunt of the war against Boko Haram as soldiers have been accused of rounding up and killing innocent people they suspected of being militants. The military has also been accused of accidentally killing civilians in airstrikes in the past. President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria has declared victory over the militants on several occasions. But the conflict endures, even though military operations have made huge progress killing and arresting hundreds of fighters. On Tuesday, Mr. Buhari said he regretted the error, and Nigerian military officials also expressed remorse, acknowledging they had targeted the wrong spot. The governor of Borno State said friendly fire incidents have occurred in wars throughout history. â€œIt is gratifying that nobody made any effort to hide anything or sweep things under carpet,â€ Gov. Kashim Shettima said. â€œWar comes with different kinds of very terrible prizes and this is one of such painful prizes. â€ The deadly mistake comes as the United States Congress is considering a sale of warplanes to the Nigerian government. Some politicians and humanitarian workers have criticized selling warplanes to a military with a poor record on human rights. Matthew Page, a consultant who until recently was the State Departmentâ€™s top expert on Nigeria, criticized the use of air power against militants whose main tactic in recent weeks has been sending one or two suicide bombers at a time in attacks on crowded markets or mosques. â€œUsing air power in this late phase of a counterinsurgency is â€ Mr. Page said. â€œThe Nigerian government would be wise to use carefully targeted,   operations, not aerial bombing campaigns, to mop up whatâ€™s left of Boko Haram. â€ In Rann, the International Committee of the Red Cross said six people in critical condition were evacuated on Tuesday by helicopter to Maiduguri. About 90 patients remained with 46 still needing to be evacuated, according to the organization. â€œThe conditions for postoperative care are not adequate, so all the patients must be evacuated to Maiduguri as soon as possible,â€ said Laurent Singa, a surgeon for the Red Cross in Rann.

21217,Another Day at a Monument to Democracy - The New York Times,Dan Barry,"WASHINGTON  â€”   The glorious Lincoln Memorial was closed on Inauguration Day, leaving its white marble inhabitant to inspire from a distance. The monument had served as a backdrop for an inaugural concert the night before, and now, in the late morning, construction workers were methodically removing the silvery bars of scaffolding that imprisoned it. Even so, its sole resident could still be seen behind the Doric columns, his gaze trained on the   domed Capitol, where a peaceful transfer of power was about to take place. And people still came to be in his presence, some to remind themselves that a country riven by dissent can come together. It has before. No matter that the sky was as gray as the Potomac, or that the cold air felt like a wet sweater. Here they were, from the North and South, East and West, in red Trump hats and blue Hillary   jubilant, distressed, feeling a part and apart. They stood in admiration of Lincoln, as workers tore down and cleaned up, including a man collecting debris with a   picker, his dog tag laced securely into one of his   boots. Ed Rich, he said his name was, while taking a Camel break.   years old. A mortgage broker from Annapolis, trying to ride out a slow period. So itâ€™s $12 an hour working for the inauguration, putting up fencing, laying down flooring, snapping up cigarette butts with a metal picker. â€œI voted for him,â€ Mr. Rich said of Donald J. Trump, at this point still the  . â€œI think he could make a mess of it, but it could be cleaned up easily. People seem to forget thereâ€™s a House and a Senate. â€ Mr. Rich tossed his spent cigarette into the box of garbage he was carrying and returned to collecting butts and paper bits, his words nowhere near as eloquent as those of Lincoln, carved into the memorialâ€™s walls, yet in the same vein: the belief  â€”   often tested, including on this day  â€”   in the countryâ€™s democratic system of governance. Generations have come to the Lincoln Memorial to reassure themselves  â€”   or to remind the rest of the nation  â€”   of this foundational belief. The   contralto, Marian Anderson, sang here in 1939, after the Daughters of the American Revolution had barred her from another Washington venue she began with â€œMy country â€™tis of thee, sweet land of liberty. â€ The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of course, delivered his â€œI Have a Dreamâ€ speech here in 1963, after Mahalia Jackson called out, â€œTell them about the dream, Martin. â€ Even Richard M. Nixon, during a dark moment of his presidency (and that is saying something) came here on a very early May morning in 1970, valet in tow he wound up in profoundly strange conversations with some Vietnam War protesters, his disjointed message: Donâ€™t give up on this country. In their footsteps came others on this inaugural morning. Jerry Naradzay, 56, a physician from Henderson, N. C. cycled up to the monument with his    son, Sammy, the fatherâ€™s broad smile explained by his red â€œMake America Great Againâ€ cap. He noted that the memorialâ€™s stone had come from both the North and the South to convey unity after division. He then said he had goose bumps just thinking of more than two centuries of peaceful transfers of power. Nodding toward the memorial, Dr. Naradzay said, â€œThis monument represents how the country is bigger than one man. â€ Standing nearby in full agreement were four Hillary Clinton supporters from Wisconsinâ€™s North Country. They had made plans for this Washington visit in expectation of a different result, but decided to come anyway, in part to participate in the womenâ€™s march on Saturday. So: How did they feel? â€œHollow,â€ said Jackie Moore, 33, a member of the Ashland City Council. Several awkward seconds of silence followed. When conversation resumed, another Ashland council member, David Mettille, 32, and his partner, Teege Mettille, 36, recounted how their blue Hillary shirts had spurred some heckling, but they didnâ€™t mind. It was their way of saying: Weâ€™re still here. â€œWe will remember this,â€ David Mettille said. â€œWe will remember how painful today is, so that four years from now  â€”   we work to win. â€ Then Teege Mettille noted that they had about a   left of President Obama, and off the visitors from Ashland went. It was true: Time was winding down, or winding up. From the   ceremony in the distance, beyond the reflecting poolâ€™s greenish waters, came the echoes of ministers beseeching God for guidance, the raised voices of the Missouri State University Chorale, the somber tones of imminent transition. All the while, others came to be in Lincolnâ€™s presence. A retired civil engineer from Virginia who said he had voted for Mr. Trump because a relative is a heroin addict, and because the Mexican border is a sieve. A couple from Utah who voted for Mr. Trump because their community depends on natural gas and oil. Mothers and their adult daughters from Texas and New Mexico, so dismayed that Mr. Trump would soon be their president that they kept their backs to the inauguration. Soon the Mormon Tabernacle Choir could be heard singing â€œAmerica the Beautiful. â€ Then came the distinctive voice of the new president, his assertions of a restored American greatness in all things floating through the gray noon and up the four score and seven steps leading from the reflecting pool to the memorial. No longer   he was now President Trump. While the pageantry unfolded, Mr. Rich, the debris collector, kept working. A former Marine, he said he spent six months in Iraq with a mortuary affairs unit, collecting bodies and body parts from the front. Sometimes there wasnâ€™t enough for certain identification, he said, â€œso youâ€™d write, â€˜Believed to be. â€™â€ He said he was making plans to succeed again in the mortgage business, in a country whose   form of government he trusts. But for now Mr. Rich had what he called his mission, which was to keep the plaza beneath Lincolnâ€™s gaze clean."

A record number of illegal aliens have crossed the U.S.- Mexico border and are in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texasâ€™ Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV), according to the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). Border Patrol Agent and NBPC President Brandon Judd spoke exclusively with Breitbart Texas and condemned the leadership of the Border Patrolâ€™s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), for allegedly â€œkeeping this information secretâ€ ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
â€œWe are at breaking point. We have the highest number of illegal aliens in custody in history in Border Patrolâ€™s RGV Sector and this information has been kept from the American public,â€ said Agent Judd. â€œThe talk of amnesty has once again created pull factors and encouraged people from all over the world to cross Mexico and then cross our porous southern border to illegally enter the U.S. We are simply overwhelmed.â€ {snip} 
Agent Judd told Breitbart Texas that Americans should vote their conscience, but they should do so with all of the information available. â€œThis is an issue of the federal government restricting crucial information from the public ahead of a presidential election and it is unacceptable. Americans deserve to know the truth. Our Border Patrol agents deserve for Americans to know what they are really facing. Too many Border Patrol agents have given their lives and left loved ones to grieve for CBP leadership to play these types of political games ahead of such an impactful election.â€ 
{snip} 
Historically, CBP, Border Patrolâ€™s parent agency, has had to correct false assertions and denials. Perhaps the most glaring example occurred in June 2014 when an official CBP Twitter account directly accused this reporter of publishing a false report, only to later admit the report was accurate and true . 
{snip} 
UPDATE: Breitbart Texas received this response from CBP: 
First, the number in custody in RGV is less than half what is was in June 2014. 
Also, I would refer you to Secretary Johnsonâ€™s statement about southwest border security issued October 17. In it, the Secretary addresses the specific issue of unaccompanied children and family units. The statement includes statistics for the full year of fiscal year 2016.

21220,Trumpâ€™s Economic Vows May Be Harder to Hit After a Slow 2016 - The New York Times,Nelson D. Schwartz,"President Trumpâ€™s target for economic growth just got a little more distant. The government reported Friday that the economy grew by only 1. 6 percent last year, shy of what experts had estimated and well below the 4 percent rate that Mr. Trump has vowed to deliver  â€”   a pledge now cited on the White House website. There are plenty of signs of life in the economy. Consumer spending is healthy, and an index of consumer sentiment just hit a   high. Stocks have been surging, and the jobless rate is near what the Federal Reserve considers full employment. But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent. Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind. While Fridayâ€™s report will provide more support for Mr. Trumpâ€™s argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administrationâ€™s plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016  â€”   like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses  â€”   could persist into 2017 and beyond. In particular, lower exports and higher imports also hurt growth in the fourth quarter, which fell to an annual rate of 1. 9 percent from 3. 5 percent in the prior quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. In 2016, personal consumption  â€”   which accounts for a majority of economic activity  â€”   slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment. All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trumpâ€™s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009. â€œIt would defy gravity,â€ Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, â€œItâ€™s simple math. â€ At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fedâ€™s plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation. Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fedâ€™s. One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar. What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obamaâ€™s second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed. â€œItâ€™s difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth,â€ said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. â€œThat would be true no matter who is the president. â€ The retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s. Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nationâ€™s infrastructure  â€”   an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus. Since Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018. That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trumpâ€™s policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term. Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2. 4 percent in 2017 and 2. 7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2. 25 percent in each year. â€œTax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than weâ€™ve had in some time,â€ he said. But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher. Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth. But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies. While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of   products abroad rises. The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trumpâ€™s economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas. On Friday, the White House announced a manufacturing jobs initiative, naming chief executives like Andrew N. Liveris of Dow Chemical and Elon Musk of Tesla to the as part of the effort, along with labor leaders from the A. F. L. . I. O. The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than   debt in Europe and Asia. â€œMr. Trump canâ€™t control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year,â€ Mr. Faucher said. â€œTrade is likely to be a drag on growth. â€"
21221,"Russian Hackers Gained â€˜Limitedâ€™ Access to R.N.C., Comey Says - The New York Times",David E. Sanger and Matt Flegenheimer,"WASHINGTON  â€”   The director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, told lawmakers at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committeeâ€™s computer records, but he called it a â€œlimited penetration of old R. N. C. â€ computer systems that were â€œno longer in use. â€ Mr. Comeyâ€™s statement was significant because the committee said weeks ago that it did not lose data to the Russians because of its strong cybersecurity.   Donald J. Trump has repeated that assertion and has also said weaknesses in Democratic National Committee systems had opened the way for their systems to be hacked. While Mr. Comey did not go into detail, he appeared to be referring to a   attack on a contractor in Tennessee, Smartech Corporation, used by the Republican committee to host some of its websites and handle some lists of donors. Federal investigators have said that a single email server used by that contractor had been penetrated. But it was going out of service and contained outdated material that the Russians probably found to be of little value. People with direct knowledge of the serverâ€™s contents said it had been used by Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain. An aide in Mr. Grahamâ€™s office said the hacking of the email server in question occurred in June. The Graham campaign was using the server to send news clips and campaign releases, the aide said. In an unclassified report released on Friday, the intelligence community reported that the Russians had attacked â€œ â€ organizations but that they had chosen not to make any of that data public. The report made no specific reference to the Republican National Committee. Pressed on the issue by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Mr. Comey said on Tuesday that there was â€œevidence of hacking directed at the state levelâ€ and at the Republican committee, â€œbut that it was old stuff. â€ He said there was no evidence â€œthat the current R. N. C. â€  â€”   he appeared to be referring to servers at the committeeâ€™s headquarters or contractors with current data  â€”   had been hacked. There is no evidence that computers used by the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign were also compromised, though the personal email account of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, was copied and released as part of the   hack. The testimony on Tuesday was the first since the release of the declassified report on Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and it came four days after the findings were described to Mr. Trump. The panel, convened by the Senate Intelligence Committee, included James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and of the militaryâ€™s Cyber Command. John O. Brennan, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Mr. Comey also testified. Mr. Clapper largely repeated the conclusions of last weekâ€™s report, including that the goal of the Russian effort was to disparage Mrs. Clinton  â€”   whom the Russians hoped to weaken if she won  â€”   and over time to favor Mr. Trump. Under questioning, Mr. Clapper said he believed that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his aides had actively ordered the operation that resulted in the hacking, though he left unclear how involved they may have been in the details. After receiving a briefing on the report on Friday, Mr. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had played no role in his election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin preferred him to Mrs. Clinton. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the committeeâ€™s vice chairman, called the election hacking â€œone of the most serious events of my public life. â€ At times, Democrats on the committee steered the conversation toward whether intelligence officials were investigating any link between the Russians and Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign. But Mr. Comey declined to discuss it. â€œEspecially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny any investigation,â€ Mr. Comey said. Many Democrats still blame him for Mrs. Clintonâ€™s defeat, citing his ambiguous letter less than two weeks before the election disclosing new questions about emails on her private server. Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who supported Mrs. Clinton, could not resist an aside. â€œThe irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid,â€ he said. Mr. Comey, seeking to establish a nonpartisan air, later joked, â€œI hope Iâ€™ve demonstrated by now Iâ€™m tone deaf when it comes to politics  â€”   and thatâ€™s the way it should be. â€ Republicans, for their part, raised few doubts about the intelligence communityâ€™s conclusions, but they dwelled little on the reportâ€™s finding that Mr. Putin had a clear preference for Mr. Trump. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, suggested that Russia had achieved its broader goal of sowing â€œchaos and disorderâ€ in the electoral system."

Regardless of the early forecasts and preliminary exit polls predicting the loss of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he won, doing far better than anyone could have predicted. By the end of the night, he had garnered 288 of the required 270 Electoral College votes, with his Democratic counterpart Hillary Clinton having received 215 votes, according to the latest data from CNN .
The question is whether Trump now has a political mandate to move forward with his many controversial domestic and foreign policy initiatives. Critics point to the fact that Trump and Clinton split the popular vote almost exactly in half, and that many of the states Trump won were only by virtue of razor-sharp margins. In addition, he will still need to contend with divisiveness within the U.S. Congress, where it may be harder to unite the nation.
Primarily, Trumpâ€™s victory results from the fact that Americans â€”faced with social and economic challenges within their own country â€” became very disappointed with their establishment and political elites as well as with the whole concept of globalization . And this trend is commonplace, not only for the U.S., but also the entire West.
Also read: "" The real reason why Vladimir Putin needs Donald Trump "" As Russiaâ€™s Former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin wrote via his Twitter account , the American presidential elections show that the current dynamic of the global processes doesnâ€™t meet the expectations of many people. He described the U.S. elections as â€œthe continuation of the Brexit,â€ with right-wing and populist forces gaining influence throughout Europe.
Prominent Western experts echo this view. For example, historian Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at Stanford Universityâ€™s Hoover Institution and Harvard Universityâ€™s Center for European Studies, argues populists like Trump â€œare nearly always part of a global phenomenon,â€ with 2016 having generated â€œa populist backlash against globalizationâ€ and this crisis itself being â€œglobal in its scope.â€
â€œPopulism today has a similarly global quality,â€ Ferguson wrote . â€œIn June, the British vote to leave the European Union was hailed by populists right across the European continent as well as by Donald Trump in the United States and, implicitly, by Vladimir Putin in Russia.â€
However, the fact that Trump was finally elected indicates that democracy has proven its resilience, despite any current challenges. ;
â€œDemocrats have lost, but democracy has won. America keeps going because it keeps changing. [It is] a bitter pill to swallow, but the body politic needed it,â€ wrote Carnegie Moscow Centerâ€™s Director Dmitri Trenin after the U.S. presidential election results indicted the victory of Trump.
Amidst the post-election buzz, Russia Direct sat down with Trenin to discuss the reasons why Americans elected Trump and what it means for U.S.-Russia relations .

Russia Direct: Donald Trump is going to be the next president of the United States. What policy toward Russia should we expect from him and how can his presidency affect U.S.-Russia relations? Dmitri Trenin: Trump is unpredictable, in my view. Yet, on the other hand, the reaction to his presidency from the American establishment will also be unpredictable, because Trump wonâ€™t be able to conduct and carry out foreign, military and any other initiatives by himself.
He will need a team and people. So far, it is very difficult to imagine who will be included in the Trump administration. How will these people be able to work with each other and find common ground? This is also not such an easy question to answer. So, this unpredictability is multilayered in its very nature. Thatâ€™s why is impossible to outline the Trump administrationâ€™s policy.
And today this aspect should be taken into account, given the fact that the current agenda of U.S.-Russia relations adds up to one key question, just like it was during the Cold War : How to prevent a hot war? I hope the U.S. and Russia will cooperate and be able to prevent the escalation from spinning out of control and turning into a conflict at the nuclear level. I hope we will avoid such a catastrophe.
RD: Some pundits and historians try to find certain logic in the impact of American presidential elections on U.S.-Russia relations throughout history. The logic is very simple: the Republicans are good for the Kremlin â€” the Democrats are not; the business-minded Republicans are easy to get along with, the idealistic Democrats are not. Thus, Trump is a chance for Russia â€” Clinton is not. This oversimplified assumption is very popular among many Russian politicians and pundits. What is your take? D.T.: Of course, it is a big oversimplification. It is a myth and it emerged in the times of Republican Richard Nixonâ€™s presidency (1969â€“1974), when the Soviet Union and the United States established a productive dialogue and the Soviet elites came to the conclusion that their American counterparts saw them as equals, based on their military-strategic parity.
This myth was further confirmed by the presidency of Jimmy Carter, who came to power as a Democrat with his ideas on human rights and nonproliferation. During his tenure, Soviet-American relations saw a significant decline. The big difference between the Republicans, whom the Kremlin saw as reasonable and approachable, and the intransigent Democrats was obvious to the Soviet leaders. Nixon and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger were easier to get along with than Carter and his team, who were very difficult to negotiate with. ;
Yet if one looks at the problem from a broader historical perspective, the closest relations between Russia and the United States were generally established in the times of Democratic presidents, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933â€“1945) and Bill Clinton (1993-2001), regardless of the fact that the last years of Clintonâ€™s presidency left an unpleasant aftertaste for Russia.
Indeed, during Clintonâ€™s tenure the U.S. saw itself as the patron. Washington was both very friendly and too intrusive toward post-Soviet Russia and didnâ€™t see it as an equal partner. But, at any rate, we cannot deny the fact it was a friendship between Moscow and Washington.
So, in my view, believing that the Republicans are better for Russia than Democrats is a myth, not to mention the fact that the U.S. is changing today, and the nature of differences between Democrats and Republicans is not the same as previously.
RD: Yet where do such myths come from historically? Politically, are there any grounds to come up with such conclusions? D.T.: Yes, there are some reasons to believe in this myth. If we oversimplify, the Republicans embody U.S. business â€” the Democrats exemplify the ideals of America. However, in reality there is no unanimity â€” there are many differences within both Republican and Democratic parties.
Business is pragmatic. It negotiates, persistently defends its interests and sincerely believes in healthy completion. This is what the Republicans put forward.
Meanwhile, the Democrats, since the times of President Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921), prioritize not material and tangible things, but political ideals such as democratic values.
Because the U.S. sees itself as the global center of democracy, the key goal of the Democrats is to make the world safer through democracy. Thus, democracy in this context is seen as the major foundation of security and the entire world order. Such logic implies that moral superiority is much more important than materialism. Thatâ€™s why the Democrats, unlike the Republicans, more rigorously focus on the domestic policy of other countries and human rights. ;
Also read: "" Trump, Clinton and the great realignment in American politics "" Thus, the co-existence of these two trends â€” material and moral aspects â€” shapes American politics.
RD: If we extrapolate this to the U.S. policy toward Russia, we face problems at any rate: in the case of idealism, the tensions between two countries will increase if the expectations of two sides about each other wonâ€™t come true. Likewise, business-minded and blunt politicians wonâ€™t necessarily alleviate these tensions. In contrast, they might aggravate the problem. So, the scheme â€œGood Republicansâ€”Bad Democratsâ€ is totally flawed. D.T.: Exactly. ; ; ; ;
RD: There is a lot of talk about American foreign policy , with the Democrats becoming more hawkish toward Russia and their Republican counterparts being friendlier toward the Kremlin. However, historically, it was vice versa. D.T.: If we talk about Donald Trump, it is the case: He is ready to establish dialogue with Russia. However, if you take the Republican camp in general, there wonâ€™t be agreement and unanimity [on how to deal with Russia]. Most importantly, the Republican representatives of the establishment are divided in their view on Trump: Some see him in a very negative light, while the others would like to establish close ties.
If we put Russia into this context, it is not seen as a serious problem for American politics despite the fact that it played a role during this yearâ€™s presidential campaign as a factor of the pre-election race . However, Russia is not a factor in U.S. foreign policy. It is not a top priority for the United States and the political establishment is hardly likely to overestimate the significance of Russia. And this trend seems to persist in the future.
Nobody in the U.S. believes that relations with Russia will be improved until the Kremlin changes its foreign policy course and stops its political rebellion against the system of international relations, established by the United States . Likewise, nobody within the U.S. establishment really believes that Russiaâ€™s foreign policy will be changed under Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to mention its domestic policy.
Moreover, the U.S. establishment is hardly likely to take Putin very seriously and negotiate with him. And this trend in U.S.-Russia bilateral relations will persist for seven-eight years. The changes that might take place in Moscow-Washington relations will depend to a greater extent on the domestic policies of Russia and the United States."
21223,Justin Trudeau Criticized for Praising Fidel Castro as â€˜Remarkable Leaderâ€™ - The New York Times,Liam Stack,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada would like the world to know that he was rather fond of Fidel Castro.

He described Mr. Castro, who ruled as a Communist autocrat for almost 50 years, as â€œCubaâ€™s longest serving President. â€ â€œWhile a controversial figure, both Mr. Castroâ€™s supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for â€˜el Comandante,â€™â€ Mr. Trudeau continued. He added that Mr. Castro was â€œa legendary revolutionary and oratorâ€ whose death had brought him â€œdeep sorrow. â€ â€œI know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away,â€ Mr. Trudeau said. (His father, Pierre Trudeau, served as prime minister for over 15 years.) â€œIt was also a real honour to meet his three sons and his brother President RaÃºl Castro during my recent visit to Cuba. â€ Justin Trudeauâ€™s affectionate comments were a radical departure from American reactions to Mr. Castroâ€™s death  â€”   the White House diplomatically said it hoped for warmer relations with Cuba, while   Donald J. Trump gleefully posted on Twitter, â€œFidel Castro is dead!â€  â€”   and his statement was quickly condemned by political observers in both the United States and Canada. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is   called the Canadian leaderâ€™s remarks â€œshameful and embarrassing. â€ Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another   said Mr. Trudeauâ€™s statement was â€œdisgracefulâ€ and accused him of â€œslobbering adulationâ€ of Mr. Castro. In Canada, several members of the opposition Conservative Party condemned Mr. Trudeauâ€™s statement. Kellie Leitch, a lawmaker running for the partyâ€™s leadership, criticized the prime minister for his â€œfawning characterizationâ€ of Mr. Castro. Maxime Bernier, another Conservative leadership candidate, called Mr. Trudeauâ€™s praise â€œrepugnantâ€ and rebuked him for suggesting that the Cuban leaderâ€™s decades in power had amounted to a form of public service. Mr. Trudeauâ€™s statement also generated a tidal wave of agitated online mockery, the kind of social media blowback to which the telegenic and infinitely   prime minister is rarely subjected. In a wink to the moment that brought Mr. Trudeau to national prominence  â€”   his televised eulogy for his father in 2000  â€”   jokes about his statement were organized under the hashtag #trudeaueulogies, where critics imagined him waxing poetic about some of historyâ€™s great villains. The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 and imposed an embargo on the island for decades, but Canada never pursued similar policies. It began formal diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1945 and maintained them throughout the Cold War, when Mr. Trudeauâ€™s father developed a warm relationship with Mr. Castro. Pierre Trudeau was the first leader of a NATO member state to visit communist Cuba in 1976, and Mr. Castro served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation."
21224,Hillaryâ€™s Warped Notion of American Exceptionalism and Indispensability - Edward Lozansky,nan,"Originally appeared at Chronicles 
Edward Lozansky is president of the American University in Moscow. 
Jim Jatras is a former U.S. diplomat and foreign policy adviser to the Senate GOP leadership. He recently published a major study, â€œ How American Media Serves as a Transmission Belt for Wars of Choice .â€ 
Perhaps one of the most used and abused political expressions in recent years has been that of â€œAmerican exceptionalism.â€ Politicians and commentators routinely invoke it as high principle and accuse their opponents of insufficient devotion to it, or contrariwise blame it for all the ills of the world. 
For example, in 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin ruffled many Americansâ€™ feathers: 
â€œIt is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. . . . We are all different, but when we ask for the Lordâ€™s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.â€ 
Hillary Clinton weighed in on exceptionalism in an August speech before the American Legion, in which she also took a swipe at Donald Trump : 
The United States is an exceptional nation. . . . But, in fact, my opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks American exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world. In fact, when Vladimir Putin, of all people, criticized American exceptionalism, my opponent agreed with him, saying, and I quote, â€˜if youâ€™re in Russia, you donâ€™t want to hear that America is exceptional.â€™ Well maybe you donâ€™t want to hear it, but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not true. 
It needs to be asked, though: when people praise or criticize â€œAmerican exceptionalism,â€ are they always talking about the same thing? 
America, like any country, has its own distinctive history, culture, and traditions. Americaâ€™s unique founding principlesâ€”consent of the governed, due process, constitutionally limited division of powers, representative governmentâ€”justly have been an inspiration to the world for over two centuries. Thomas Jefferson wrote of the â€œpalpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God.â€ 
This â€œexceptionalâ€ idea was new in human history. Any American worthy of the name justly takes pride in it. This is the genuine American exceptionalism of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, lately championed by Reagan. The fact that we have strayed so far from it, both domestically and internationally, is shameful. 
The unique moral revolution to which the Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor has little connection to the bastard term (usually capitalized as â€œAmerican Exceptionalismâ€) that describes post-Cold War U.S. global behavior, by which policymakers in Washington assert both an exclusive â€œleadershipâ€ privilege and unsupportable obligation to undertake open-ended international missions in the name of the â€œFree Worldâ€ and the â€œinternational community.â€ This is the counterfeit â€œExceptionalismâ€ of a tiny clique of bipartisanapparatchikiâ€”GOP â€œneoconservativesâ€ and Democrat â€œliberal interventionistsâ€ and their mainstream media mouthpieces â€”who have little regard for our countryâ€™s oldest traditions or the security and welfare of the American people. 
This second kind of Exceptionalism means that the rules we demand of other countries donâ€™t apply to us (so much for Jeffersonâ€™s appeal in the Declaration of Independence to â€œa decent respect to the opinions of mankindâ€). Its proponents justify â€œregime changeâ€ in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine, maybe in Russia too . They have wasted trillions of Americansâ€™ tax dollars in the process of making us less safe, not more. Now the Obama Administration is willing to risk confronting Moscow and sparking a new world war in a bid to save al-Qaeda in Aleppo. As Trump has noted: â€œ You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton .â€ 
It is this debased and dangerous kind of Exceptionalism that Hillary represents. Closely related is her concept of Americaâ€™s â€œindispensabilityâ€ : 
â€œWe are the indispensable nation. People all over the world look to us and follow our lead. . . . When America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void.â€ 
Itâ€™s no coincidence she is preferred by self-regarded indispensable hacks of both parties who have been up to their elbows in every foreign mess since Reagan. Starting next year, they are eager to give us more of the same. 
For genuine patriots, the true, uniquely American exceptionalism of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution is our precious inheritance. Americaâ€™s true exceptionalism is the antithesis of what Hillary and her acolytes intend, as attested by John Quincy Adams : â€œWherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will [Americaâ€™s] heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.â€ 
In scouring the world for monsters to destroy Hillaryâ€™s perversion of authentic American principles has more in common with Soviet universalism than the vision of the Founders. In pursuing â€œ benevolent global hegemony â€ the supposed indispensables suggest that other countries and peoples are dispensableâ€”or disposable. In the process, Americansâ€™ freedoms have become disposable too. This is, in a word, un-Americanâ€”a good old expression that needs to make a comeback. 
Genuine American exceptionalism and the â€œAmerica Firstâ€ policies of Donald Trump donâ€™t mean our withdrawal from the world. U.S. primacy in a multipolar system is something most countries, including Russia and China, would be prepared to accept, however grudgingly. But continuing down the road Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush have blazed for a quarter century promises us just more war, more enemies, and eventual catastrophe.

21225,A Sober Look at Everyday Life in Besieged Donetsk,Jafe Arnoldski (noreply@blogger.com),"November 7, 2016 -  Aleksey Ilyashevich, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


How has life changed in Donbass compared to before the war? For a person who hasnâ€™t had the opportunity to personally visit the Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic, answering this question is not easy. Experts argue themselves hoarse on TV screens and instill the most different impressions in us, ranging from Donbass being paradise on earth to a semi-starving ghetto. Where is the truth? As always, the truth is somewhere in the middle.  
Of course, life in the DPR is far from our usual ideas about wellbeing, but war doesnâ€™t change peopleâ€™s lives for the better. Letâ€™s set aside our usually loaded judgements and look at the problem from the other side. Over the past few years of war, the people of Donbass have encountered processes and phenomena with which they never had to deal in peacetime. Some of them are negative and some are positive, but many are difficult to evaluate. They simply exist, and they often offer a better picture of life in the DPR than dry statistics. What exactly are we dealing with? 
Curfew 
It is very difficult to adapt to curfew, especially for those who returned to the republicsâ€™ cities after a lengthy absence, for which they risk spending a night at the local police department. A second violation threatens 15 days of detention. The curfew lasts from 23:00 until 5:00, but by 22:00 all drinking and entertainment establishments are supposed to be closed so that people can make it home in time. A special permit is needed to be on the streets at night. This equally applies to soldiers. 
Police law allows law enforcement to act against violators of the curfew very decisively, including up to the use of firearms if necessary. 
The curfew has been enforced in the DPR since 2014. Since then, it has only been cancelled once - for last yearâ€™s New Yearâ€™s Eve. The purpose of such measures is not only protecting citizens, but also preventing the DPR territoryâ€™s penetration by the enemyâ€™s sabotage-reconnaissance groups. Most people have already become accustomed to the curfew, but they still donâ€™t stop complaining about it (especially young people).  Without a doubt, the curfew regime has been one of the most tangible changes in the lives of the republicâ€™s population. 
Humanitarian aid 
Compared with 2014 and 2015, the role of humanitarian aid has significantly dropped, but it still comes in to help pensioners whose incomes donâ€™t allow them to purchase all the necessary products. However, it is not only pensioners that receive humanitarian aid, as certain humanitarian aid is specifically provided to patients with diabetes, families with young children, and other vulnerable parts of the population. Deliveries are kept streaming in and, as a rule, problems usually donâ€™t arise. 


Humanitarian aid came to Donbass along with the war and became firmly established as part of life in every home. Today it is difficult to find a family in which no one stands in line to receive humanitarian aid. 
Lines 
Two years of life in semi-wartime conditions has brought many difficulties to the republicâ€™s inhabitants. One of the most noticeable is the rise of queues. It sometimes seems like life here has turned into one big line - lines to the bank, lines for humanitarian aid, lines for salaries (stipends and pensions as well), lines at checkpoints, and lines at the customs checkpoint when going to Russia 
The main trend in lines in 2016 has been the queues for registering for and receiving passports of the Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic. 
If the passport office begins to accept citizens at 9:00, then people start forming a queue at 5:00. Even those lines which existed before the war have now become even longer with the exception, perhaps, of shop lines. The state apparatus itself is most often at fault, especially since it is more bureaucratized than before the war. But thatâ€™s another story. 
The revival of sports 
The professional football, basketball, and hockey teams of Donetsk left, so now youth sports are developing much more actively than before. Competitions for young people in different cities of the republic are held with stunning regularity. Caring Russians have contributed to developing sports and the DPR is actively represented and participates in championships in Russia. 
A recent example: the students sports club called Red Profintern from the city of Enakievo took part in the Russian Taekwondo Cup at the All-Russian Qualifying Tournament for the 2016 world championships of martial arts. Before the war, children never participated in sports at such a level.  
Children play football in a camp for refugees from Donbass in Russia's Rostov region 
The authorities of the Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic have not bet on sports by coincidence. Maintaining youth in an unrecognized state is possible by opening up a sporting future. There are simply no other effective ways. This explains the rapid development of youth sports. 
The republicâ€™s media 
Journalism in the DPR today is, unfortunately, at a low level. Many Donbass journalists left during the war. The shortage of personnel has been filled by young people who continue to grow into the place of their older colleagues. Nevertheless, the process of forming and developing a republican media is in full swing. 
Four television channels operate on the territory of the DPR along with several radio stations, and almost every city has an urban mass newspaper. Local media are developing much more actively today than in the prewar period, as often only they can quickly provide reliable information on what is happening in the state.  
Changes to school curriculum  
Curriculum in schools and university has remained fundamentally the same as it was before the war, but certain changes have occurred. Above all, this affects history. If earlier pupils and students studied the history of Ukraine, then today it has been replaced by the history of the Fatherland. By Fatherland is meant Donbass, which is considered in the context of both Ukrainian and Russian history. 
Something similar is occurring with law students, who have had a hard time. For example, in constitutional law courses, they have to study three constitutions at once: the Ukrainian, Russian, and republican ones.  
Ukrainian language and literature have not been removed. The number of hours of these subjects remains at the pre-war level. The poets and writers are the same. Even Taras Shevchenko and his displeasure with Tsarist policies has been left in the books. 
But what has really changed is the situation with admission into universities. If earlier graduates passed the External Independent Testing (similar to the Russian Unified State Exam), then today they have to pass school exams as a result of which they can enroll. The state examinations differ little in assessment though, as the questions are developed according to the same scheme. 
Education in the DPR has been declared to have transitioned to Russian standards. But by this is understood rather things of a technical nature, while the content of curricula in secondary and higher educational institutions has undergone only some minor changes. 
The quality of roads and streets 
The state of roads in the republic, like before, still leaves much to be desired, but the DPR authorities began to handle this as early as 2014. A team of workers laying asphalt is for todayâ€™s Donetsk a picture more than ordinary. Even driveways are being repaired. They might not be much better as a rule, but itâ€™s difficult to judge things under shelling. 
Speaking of automobile roads in Donbass, theyâ€™ve been â€œunloadedâ€ over the years of war, as there are fewer cars. Their number sharply declined during the spring and summer of 2014, when many owners left personal vehicles outside of the republic or feared to exploit their iron horses - using their positions, some â€œprivatizersâ€ acting in the name of the militia didnâ€™t hesitate to â€œcommandeerâ€ cars. 
In 2015, the city gradually started to be flooded by cars again, but the pre-war traffic still doesnâ€™t threaten the republicâ€™s roads.  


More than a little has been said about how Donetskâ€™s frontline streets are cleaner than streets in peace-enjoying Kiev. There are several reasons for this.  
First of all, there is the selfless work of public services, whose employees have been under fire and killed or received severe injuries. 
Secondly, the attitude of the people of Donbass towards their city has changed over the war, so they litter significantly less. Thanks to this, Donetskâ€™s appearance, as well as that of other cities of the republic, has really changed for the better. 
The cleanliness of streets is one of the main positive changes of recent years.  
The ruble zone and Russian goods 
In 2015, the DPR introduced the ruble into circulation alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia. On the republicâ€™s territory was declared a so-called multi-currency zone, where purchases could be paid for in hryvnia, rubles, or even dollars. I myself was witness to when a woman bought bread with a $100 bill and the clerk gave her change in rubles. 
However, the Russian currency quickly established a monopoly. Today, all financial transactions on the republicâ€™s territory are done in rubles.  
A small mass of hryvnia remains thanks to the workers of Ukrainian enterprises on DPR territory, who are paid their wages in hryvnia. The republicâ€™s transition to a ruble zone is one of the key changes for residents of the DPR. 
Goods from Ukrainian manufacturers are almost gone from DPR shelves. Instead of them are products from Russia and Belarus. By and large, the Ukrainian blockade contributed to the resulting product vacuum being filled by competitors. As a result, Ukrainian business lost a multimillion dollar market which fell into the hands of the â€œMoskalâ€ [derogatory Ukrainian slang for Russians - JA]. Another great Ukrainian â€œvictory,â€ I suppose. 
*** 
As can be seen, life in the Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic is complex and not familiar to those who have never lived in a war zone, but it is far from the nightmares described in the Ukrainian media. Local people have learned to live in new conditions in 2 years (even if they havenâ€™t gotten used to it, as you just canâ€™t) and have tried to build the best life possible in every sphere in the republic. 

Patience, love for oneâ€™s native land, and dedication allow people not merely to survive, but to live with dignity despite all the difficulties and problems in the DPR. And there are certainly enough of them, over which people have accumulated more than a few complaints and questions for the local government and the situation overall.

21226,"Gennifer Flowers at Debate? Just Making a Point, Says Team Trump - The New York Times",Ashley Parker and Maggie Haberman,"Donald J. Trumpâ€™s campaign moved on Sunday to squelch reports  â€”   set off by the candidate himself  â€”   that Gennifer Flowers, the woman whose claims of an affair with Bill Clinton imperiled his 1992 presidential campaign, would be Mr. Trumpâ€™s guest on Monday at his first debate with Hillary Clinton. In television interviews on Sunday morning, Mr. Trumpâ€™s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, flatly denied that Ms. Flowers would attend the debate, at Hofstra University on Long Island. And Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that in threatening on Saturday to invite Ms. Flowers, Mr. Trump had merely been making a point. â€œHe wants to remind people that heâ€™s a great counterpuncher,â€ Ms. Conway said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week. â€ The specter of Ms. Flowersâ€™s attendance arose during a skirmish of psychological warfare between the two campaigns and their supporters in the   to Monday nightâ€™s matchup. Mark Cuban, the voluble billionaire who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and is supporting Mrs. Clinton, announced on Twitter on Thursday that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign had given him a   seat at the debate to watch her â€œoverwhelmâ€ Mr. Trump. For good measure, Mr. Cuban  â€”   who once hosted a   reality television show called â€œThe Benefactor,â€ and more recently offered $10 million to the charity of Mr. Trumpâ€™s choice if the Republican nominee would let Mr. Cuban interview him for four hours about his â€œpolicies and their substanceâ€  â€”   suggested the debate would become known as the â€œHumbling at Hofstra. â€ On Saturday, Mr. Trump responded even more provocatively. The   Mr. Trump, whose second marriage grew out of an affair during his first one, has repeatedly raised Mr. Clintonâ€™s infidelities as a character attack against Mrs. Clinton. Several of Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers have a long history of calling attention to Mr. Clintonâ€™s scandals. Ms. Flowers herself lent credence to the idea: â€œYes I will be there,â€ she wrote in a text message to The New York Times on Saturday. She did not respond to   messages on Sunday. Each campaign receives tickets from the Commission on Presidential Debates to give to supporters at its discretion, and campaigns often engage in mind games when picking guests, as appeared to be the case with Mrs. Clintonâ€™s choice of Mr. Cuban. But inviting Ms. Flowers would be in a different category. In 1992, Mr. Clinton denied Ms. Flowersâ€™s claim of an affair, but years later, when asked in a deposition whether he had engaged in â€œsexual relationsâ€ with Ms. Flowers, he admitted having done so one time, in 1977. Ms. Flowers, in recently broadcast interviews, has accused Mrs. Clinton of being an â€œenablerâ€ and has said the scandal is a relevant issue in 2016. Inviting Ms. Flowers would be risky for Mr. Trump, because he faces a potentially   gender gap with women, who might be troubled by such an aggressive and personal move. On NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press,â€ John Podesta, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, portrayed Mr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter post about Ms. Flowers as yet another example of behavior unbecoming of someone seeking the presidency. â€œYou saw his reaction, which is to do his favorite sport, which is to dive in the sewer and go for a swim,â€ Mr. Podesta said. But on â€œFox News Sunday,â€ Mr. Pence, the Indiana governor, sought to put an end to the matter. â€œGennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night,â€ Mr. Pence said. â€œDonald was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from where the people  â€”   the American people  â€”   are going to be focused tomorrow night, which is on the issues. Itâ€™s on the choice that we face. â€"
21227,Anxiety grows among GOP congressional staffers,Wayne Madsen,"Anxiety grows among GOP congressional staffers By Wayne Madsen Posted on October 28, 2016 by Wayne Madsen 
With their bosses away campaigning, some for their political lives, a number of Republican staffers in Congress are growing anxious over their future employment. With the Senate now favored to be transferred to Democratic control, GOP staffers for members up for re-election on November 8, as well as Republican staffers assigned to various Senate committees and subcommittees, are shopping around their resumes. 
Although more senior staff can always expect to find employment with Washingtonâ€™s many lobbying firms and policy-wonkish institutes and foundations, that is not necessarily the case with younger staffers who may find their future options being limited to Starbuckâ€™s baristas and Uber drivers. 
On the House of Representatives side, Republicans are expected to lose a number of seats in a Democratic wave but GOP control of the House, barring a dramatic shift, is expected to remain in Republican hands. However, staffers for GOP members who are in close races or facing certain defeat are also scurrying around Washington looking for future employment. 
In what could be termed poetic justice, many Republican staffers who helped push their bossesâ€™ memes against government â€œentitlementâ€ programs, including unemployment benefits, may be among the first in line at District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland state unemployment offices come December.

21228,FARC Rebels in Colombia Reach Cease-Fire Deal With Government - The New York Times,Nicholas Casey,"The Colombian government and the countryâ€™s largest rebel group said Wednesday that they had agreed to a   clearing a major hurdle in the effort to end one of the worldâ€™s   conflicts. In a joint statement, the two sides said that they had overcome some of the most intractable parts of a peace deal, which they have been negotiating in Havana since 2012. In addition to a   the rebels  â€”   known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC  â€”   agreed to lay down their arms. The two sides said they would hold a ceremony in Havana on Thursday to mark the   attended by Colombiaâ€™s president, Juan Manuel Santos, the FARC leader Rodrigo LondoÃ±o and other Latin American leaders. Negotiators hope a final peace deal will be reached in the days or weeks to come. â€œTomorrow will be a great day,â€ Mr. Santos said in a statement. â€œWe worked for peace in Colombia, a dream which is now becoming reality. â€ On Twitter, the FARC responded: â€œWe made it. The path to peace must continue, because itâ€™s not an illusion now, itâ€™s a promise. â€ The agreement sets in motion an end to the regionâ€™s oldest conflict. An estimated 220, 000 people have been killed in more than 50 years of fighting between the guerrillas and the government. More than five million people are estimated to have been displaced. The agreement to lay down arms sets the stage for what will be one of the largest demobilization of guerrilla fighters in years. An estimated 7, 000 FARC foot soldiers and commanders would be expected to disarm. Many were kidnapped as children by the guerrillas and know no other life than one with the rebels. Under a related agreement reached last year during the negotiations, FARC soldiers would enter into a â€œtransitional justiceâ€ system, with reduced sentences for those who confess to crimes that took place during the conflict. In many cases, the punishments are expected to be limited to community service. Unicef, the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund, will assist in reintegrating hundreds of child soldiers whom the FARC agreed in May to release. Many quarters of Colombia celebrated the steps announced on Wednesday. â€œThis is a transcendent step,â€ said Alejo Vargas, a political scientist who heads a group that brought war victims to Havana to speak with negotiators during the talks. â€œEven if itâ€™s not the final deal, we can say without a doubt the process is irreversible now. â€ Others lent support, but voiced concerns about how the deal would be enacted. Luis Mendieta, a former chief of Colombiaâ€™s National Police who was kidnapped for 12 years by the FARC, said he worried that many guerrillas would join criminal gangs rather than disarm. He also said that while the FARC had agreed to lay down arms, he believed the group was continuing to extort Colombians in the countryside they control. â€œThe FARC must now not just begin a   but end all their hostilities,â€ he said. â€œThe two arenâ€™t the same thing. â€ The FARC, whose origins date to the early 1960s, was founded as a   group that vowed to defend the countryâ€™s peasants from   governments in Colombia. But as the years wore on, the group found a potent source of revenue in kidnapping city dwellers. By the 1990s, the FARC had also expanded into the coca trade, earning millions by taxing growers and, according to American and Colombian officials, trafficking cocaine. In 1999, the two governments announced Plan Colombia, an aid package in which the United States poured some $10 billion into Colombia to fight drug traffickers. Many FARC leaders have been killed and the group has suffered from mass desertions in its ranks. It counted 17, 000 members in the early 2000s, a group that is estimated at 7, 000 or fewer today. During the negotiations, the Colombian president, Mr. Santos, said he would hold a referendum on the agreement. A peace plan remains generally popular among most Colombians, with recent polls showing a majority  â€”   around 60 percent  â€”   saying they would vote for it. Among the harshest critics of the deal is Ãlvaro Uribe, the former Colombian president whose military crackdown on the FARC many credit with forcing the rebels to the negotiating table. Mr. Uribe has repeatedly said the deal amounts to an amnesty for the FARC and has accused Mr. Santos of being a traitor. Jorge Robledo, a leftist senator from an opposition party, says Mr. Uribeâ€™s position is too extreme. While he believes that challenges remain in reintegrating FARC members into society, the opportunity for a   is too important to pass up, he said. â€œDisarming the FARC wonâ€™t resolve all of Colombiaâ€™s problems,â€ he said. â€œSome violence will disappear, some wonâ€™t. And other problems will continue in this country, like poverty, unemployment, an agrarian crisis and corruption. But this doesnâ€™t take away from the immense importance that a   has for this country. â€"
21229,5 Killed at BPM Festival in Mexico - The New York Times,Kirk Semple,"MEXICO CITY  â€”   Five people were killed early Monday at a crowded nightclub in the popular Caribbean tourist destination of Playa del Carmen, Mexico, when an armed man who had been denied entry opened fire inside the club, prompting a gun battle and a stampede, officials said. Four of the victims, including three members of the security team that had blocked the gunmanâ€™s entry, were hit by bullets, and the fifth victim was trampled in the resulting pandemonium, the authorities said. The shooting occurred at the Blue Parrot nightclub, which was hosting the final night of the BPM Festival, an international electronic music event that draws fans from around the world. The gunman entered the club around 2:30 a. m. but was turned away at the door because he was carrying a weapon, said Miguel Ãngel Pech, the state attorney for Quintana Roo State, on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. The man then opened fire, and as patrons threw themselves to the ground or rushed for the exits, security guards at the club â€œrepelledâ€ the attacker, Mr. Pech said, adding that the guards were apparently armed. The victims included two Canadians, a Colombian, an Italian and a Mexican, and at least 15 other people were injured, including at least three Americans, the authorities said. The gunman has not been captured or identified, but several people were detained soon after the shooting and were being held for questioning, officials said. Mr. Pech, speaking at a news conference on Monday morning, did not suggest why the gunman had tried to enter the club with a weapon, but he said the attack was not an act of terrorism. In an interview with Foro TV later in the day, the state attorney said that investigators had not discounted the possibility that the attack had something to do with a fight between criminal groups or with an extortion racket. Investigators at the scene have recovered 20 casings from three firearms, officials said, though it remained unclear whether some of the bullets had been fired by weapons belonging to the security personnel or, perhaps, to one or more patrons. Humera Hamad, a resident of El Paso, Tex. who was on vacation in Playa del Carmen, said she was in the club when the shooting started. â€œI couldnâ€™t see anything,â€ she said in an interview. â€œI just heard a blast and ran out of there, then started jumping fences. â€ She added, â€œI never looked back. â€ Fabian GonzÃ¡lez Camacho, 33, was standing outside the club, near the entrance, and ran for safety after the attack began. â€œI kept thinking: â€˜This is going to be a massacre. They are going to kill us all,â€™â€ he said. Survivors sought sanctuary in other nightclubs and stores, he said. â€œA wave of panic, uncertainty and survival kicked in,â€ he said. â€œWe were all vulnerable people, having fun, getting drunk, many also doing drugs, and then this happened. â€ Videos taken after the shooting and posted online showed clubgoers rushing through the streets of the resort town and crouching beneath tables outside nearby clubs and bars, stricken faces bathed in the glow of neon lights. â€œWe are overcome with grief over this senseless act of violence,â€ the BPM Festival management said in a statement posted on the companyâ€™s Facebook page. The festival is an annual   event that draws D. J. s, industry professionals and revelers from around the world to Playa del Carmen, on the Caribbean coast of the YucatÃ¡n. The shooting could put a dent in the robust tourism industry of the YucatÃ¡n, which has generally been less violent than many other places in Mexico, attracting millions of visitors to its white sand beaches and Mayan ruins."
21230,"Boris Johnson Wonâ€™t Seek to Lead Britain, but Michael Gove Will - The New York Times",Steven Erlanger and Stephen Castle,"LONDON  â€”   In a day of intrigue and betrayal, predictions about the next prime minister of Britain were overturned on Thursday as the presumed favorite, Boris Johnson, said he would not run after his ally in the Brexit campaign, Michael Gove, suddenly announced his candidacy. Mr. Gove had once ruled himself out for the job. His   Thursday wrecked Mr. Johnsonâ€™s prospects and enhanced those of Theresa May, the home secretary, who had backed the Remain campaign but with little enthusiasm. With Mr. Johnson out, the prospect of a race between Ms. May, 59, and Mr. Gove, 48, the justice secretary, also indicated that the next prime minister would not seek to keep Britain in the   single market of the European Union if the price was no restriction on immigration from the bloc. The sense that Mr. Johnson, the former London mayor, might try to reach a softer deal with Brussels, and his unwillingness to promise key jobs to Mr. Gove and other leaders of the campaign to exit the European Union, helped doom his candidacy, legislators said. Mr. Gove said Thursday that he had â€œcome, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. â€ Ms. May supported staying in the European Union but was a relatively quiet voice in that debate and made no enemies. She is considered a candidate of continuity who is farther to the right than Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced his resignation the day after the vote for to leave the bloc. On Thursday, Ms. May ruled out a second referendum or any effort to rejoin the European Union, emphasizing that there must be better control of immigration. â€œBrexit means Brexit,â€ she said. â€œThe campaign was fought, the vote was held, turnout was high and the public gave their verdict,â€ she said. â€œThere must be no attempts to remain inside the E. U. no attempts to rejoin it through the back door and no second referendum. â€ She said that negotiations with Brussels would take years and that they would not start before the end of the year, despite impatience among European leaders. It is notable that the chairman of her campaign is a â€œBrexitâ€ supporter, Chris Grayling, the leader of the House of Commons. While the bookmakers made Ms. May the new favorite to succeed Mr. Cameron, she is vulnerable to charges that in her years as home secretary, she failed to reduce net immigration to Britain. Also seeking the office are Stephen Crabb, a young Welsh lawmaker who is the work and pensions secretary Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister and Liam Fox, a former defense secretary. The turmoil in the Conservative Party is following a script, with friends betrayed and secret deals, that seems derived from â€œGame of Thrones,â€ itself drawn from centuries of English history. Mr. Johnson, in his own speech, included a reference to Brutus in â€œJulius Caesar,â€ and spoke of â€œa tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. â€ It was not a time to â€œfight against the tide of history, but to take that tide at the flood and sail on to fortune,â€ Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson himself played Brutus to Prime Minister Cameronâ€™s Caesar. But he got to be Caesar for only a very short time before Mr. Gove took on the role of Brutus. Mr. Johnson, a betrayer betrayed, seemed more rueful than angry. And he was silent about which candidate he might now support. Mr. Gove, who was a close friend of Mr. Cameron before backing the British exit, appears to have been encouraged to run by Cameron aides who vowed privately to try to block the ascension of Mr. Johnson, regarded as more interested in the game of politics than in the substance. It has been evident in the days since the referendum that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove had had no   plan for what to do if they won, and that they have disagreements about how to approach the future. Even Thursday morning, Mr. Gove was vague about his aims should he become prime minister. He said his â€œplan for the United Kingdom, which I hope can provide unity and changeâ€ would be unveiled â€œin the coming days. â€ Ms. May, the daughter of a vicar, portrayed herself as a candidate for ordinary voters. â€œIf youâ€™re from an ordinary   family, life is just much harder than many people in politics realize,â€ she said. â€œYou have a job, but you often donâ€™t have job security. â€ â€œFrankly, not everybody in Westminster understands that,â€ she said, referring to Parliament and the government. If selected by the Conservatives, she would be the second woman to become Britainâ€™s prime minister, after Margaret Thatcher. The five candidates will be winnowed down to two by successive votes by Conservative Party members of Parliament, beginning on July 5. One of those two will then be chosen as the next leader by the 150, 000 or so registered members of the party, with an outcome to be announced on Sept. 9. The opposition Labour Party, too, is in the midst of a leadership struggle. The incumbent, Jeremy Corbyn, overwhelmingly lost a   vote among Labourâ€™s members of Parliament, but he has said he will not resign. He faces an expected challenge by Angela Eagle, the former Labour spokeswoman for business. If both Ms. May and Ms. Eagle emerge victorious, women would lead Britain and Scotland. Women would head both main British political parties as well as all three in Scotland and one in Wales. There were auguries on Wednesday when an email to Mr. Gove from his wife, Sarah Vine, a journalist, was leaked. In it, she urged her husband to approach a commitment to Mr. Johnson with skepticism, and to lock down any commitments beforehand, especially on controls over immigration. She encouraged Mr. Gove to have â€œleverageâ€ in his dealings with Mr. Johnson, claiming that without Mr. Goveâ€™s support, the Conservative Party membership will not have â€œthe necessary reassurance to back Borisâ€ in the leadership vote. In another Shakespearean reference, Ms. Vine has been lampooned on social media as a pushy, plotting Lady Macbeth. Less than two weeks ago, just days before the June 23 referendum, Mr. Gove was adamant that he did not have the desire or the talent to become prime minister. Praising Mr. Cameron â€œas an exceptional person with exceptional talents,â€ Mr. Gove told The Daily Telegraph, â€œI donâ€™t think I have got that exceptional level of ability required for the job. â€ Four years ago, Mr. Gove told the BBC, â€œI could not be prime minister, Iâ€™m not equipped to be prime minister, I donâ€™t want to be prime minister. â€ But all that was then. Mark Field, a legislator who was planning to back Mr. Johnson, said, â€œAt least it shows that itâ€™s not just the Labour Party that is capable of being a complete shambles. â€"
21231,How does the Soviet past affect Russia's relations with the world?,"RBTH, Nikolai Shevchenko","fall of the ussr , Valdai , sochi In days when modern Moscow is being accused of pursuing similar ambitions to the USSR, the assembled experts tried to formulate the basic myths about Russiaâ€™s Soviet past. Source: Panthermedia / Vostock-photo 
The world's leading scholars and analysts from the Valdai Club have analyzed collapse of the Soviet Union and compared the direction of current Russian foreign policy to that of its predecessor at a meeting of the international discussion forum in Sochi on Oct. 24-27. 
In days when modern Moscow is being accused of pursuing similar ambitions to the USSR, the assembled experts tried to formulate the basic myths about Russiaâ€™s Soviet past and discussed whether the Kremlin is seeking to re-establish. Deliberately dismantled? 
""I do not believe that there is an inevitability that in 1991 the Soviet Union had to collapse. There are plenty of reasons why it did not have to occur then,"" Robert Legvold, Professor Emeritus at Columbia University and director of the Euro-Atlantic Security Initiative, told RBTH, adding that none of the main theories that experts put forward in their search for the causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 explain the phenomenon fully. 
Wherever the reasons for the collapse were hidden â€“ in the political and economic system of the USSR or the problem of nationalities that fueled separatist aspirations in some parts of the multinational association â€“ it is still impossible to say with certainty why the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, said Legvold. 
13th annual meeting of Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi / Source: Anatoly Strunin / TASS 
The failure to completely understand the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union fuels the opinion that the Soviet Union was deliberately dismantled. 
""In Russia, too many people believe that the Soviet Union was dismantled, rather than that it broke down on its own,"" Andrei Tsygankov, a professor at the departments of political science and international relations at San Francisco State University, told RBTH. 
The view that the crisis in the Soviet Union was not of a structural nature is confirmed by the fact that in 1988 the economic situation in the USSR improved, Tsygankov said. 
""Perhaps it was not a structural, but a cyclical crisis. If the policies had been different, it would have been possible to change the situation,"" he suggested. 
However, an even more interesting question, according to Tsygankov, concerns the extrapolation of the principles of Soviet foreign policy to modern Russia. Few ambitions 
""The train has left,"" said Richard Sakwa, Professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent, responding to RBTH's question about whether Moscow is looking for the impact on other countries that it had in Soviet times. 
It is a mistake to think that any strengthening of Russian influence in the post-Soviet space should necessarily mean the Kremlin's desire to recreate the Soviet Union, he explained. 
Legvold agreed, arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s infamous words about the collapse of the USSR being ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century"" should not be interpreted as his desire to restore the Soviet Union at the earliest opportunity. Putin: Use of 'mythical' Russian military threat a â€˜profitable business' 
Contemporary Moscow has no ambitions to involve neighboring countries in Cold War-era blocs, believes Legvold. According to the expert, Russia, like any country, wants to have a say in making regional decisions affecting its interests, but this does not mean that Russia is looking for a way to gain full control over its neighbors. 
That is why the countries of the Western world should not take Russia as a potential aggressor; Moscow's main task now is to improve the economic and demographic situation in the country, says John Mearsheimer, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. 
At the same time, a number of those gathered in Sochi expressed a belief that criticism of Russian integration initiatives is due to the fact that they call into question the faith of the Western countries that there is no alternative to the modern world order. 
""The universal system established by the West after 1991 is trying to [â€¦] homogenize political space across the globe,"" said Sakwa. ""The development of BRICS and other alternatives is precisely the argument to say that there is now an alternative force, where this unipolar universalism no longer applies."" 
At the same time, Moscow is not looking for ways to oppose the Western world with an alternative world order deliberately, according to experts, who are convinced that Russia's foreign policy initiatives, including its increasingly close cooperation with China, is due primarily to the U.S. and EU policies toward Moscow. 
""Russians tend to react to the Americans [â€¦]. It is the Americans pushing the Russians towards the Chinese which, I believe, is not in Americaâ€™s national interests,"" said Mearsheimer."
21232,President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France Wonâ€™t Seek Re-election - The New York Times,Adam Nossiter,"STRASBOURG, France  â€”   Battered by months of dismal approval ratings and a stubbornly high unemployment rate, President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France announced Thursday night that he would not compete in next yearâ€™s election. The unprecedented decision opened up and energized Franceâ€™s presidential race even as it added further turmoil to the countryâ€™s unsettled politics. It also injected new uncertainty into the political dynamic of Europe as   and populist forces are gaining strength across the Continent, as well as in the United States. Mr. Hollande had kept France in suspense for months over whether he would seek another term, turning his choice into a kind of national guessing game. His surprise decision  â€”   he had been expected to run  â€”   was the latest in a series of shocks to French and European politics, which have been upended throughout the year by voter discontent with establishment governance, Mr. Hollandeâ€™s included. The announcement  â€”   issued by the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace, the seat of the presidency  â€”   was greeted across the political spectrum as a courageous and dignified decision that, as Mr. Hollande himself made clear, was intended to place the interests of the country above his own. â€œAs a Socialist, because that is my lifeâ€™s commitment, I cannot accept, I cannot come to terms with the dispersion of the left, with its splitting up,â€ Mr. Hollande said in a somber statement. â€œBecause that would remove all hope of winning in the face of conservatism and, worse yet, of extremism. â€ So low had his ratings fallen  â€”   Mr. Hollande plumbed historic depths in some surveys, going as low as 4 percent  â€”   that many of his own Socialist colleagues had warned publicly that he was headed for certain defeat if he chose to run. More than that, hanging on to the mantle of   for the Socialists threatened to bring the party down with him, rendering it all but irrelevant in elections next spring. That prospect had split his own political grouping wide open. He was even forced to submit to a humiliating primary election  â€”   also without precedent  â€”   to decide who would be the partyâ€™s candidate. Several of his former cabinet ministers had already announced they would run against him. Now, with Mr. Hollande out, the Socialists are thought to have improved their chances, even if only slightly. His    prime minister, Manuel Valls, is likely to step up as a leading contender in the primary. Mr. Valls is associated with a kind of toughness that analysts and citizens found lacking in Mr. Hollande, and that could help him compete in the general election against candidates from the right. Those now include a former prime minister, FranÃ§ois Fillon, who was chosen on Sunday by the   Republican Partyâ€™s voters, and the   National Frontâ€™s Marine Le Pen. Both have ridden a wave of nationalist fervor, anger over immigration and worries about Islamist terrorism, and Mr. Valls has sounded similarly   themes. At the same time, Mr. Valls could be tainted by his association with Mr. Hollandeâ€™s administration, which has been a study in the slow slipping away of authority. For years an unremarkable Socialist functionary who rose slowly through the ranks, waiting for his turn, Mr. Hollande owed his narrow election in 2012 more to disgust with the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, than to any personal appeal he exerted. Still, the French left was delighted that after years in the political wilderness, it finally had an apparent champion in Mr. Hollande. But he never settled on a clear line of policy. First he campaigned as an   Socialist, with threats against finance. Once in office, he quickly veered to giving tax breaks to companies. Finally, he tried to push through a   overhaul, but largely backed down after huge street protests. Personal scandals did not help. His image as a leader was severely weakened early on when he was photographed on the back of a motorcycle going to a clandestine tryst with an actress. A   separation from his   partner followed, as well as a   book by her. He then dealt himself a final, perhaps fatal, blow by spending hours confiding the inner workings of his presidency to a pair of journalists. Their book of his confessions, published this fall, was greeted with outrage by members of his party, who were baffled that the man who held the countryâ€™s highest office would commit such an act of political suicide. It also made clear that he held basic doubts about socialism, enraging what was left of the partyâ€™s rank and file. Analysts have long pointed to Mr. Hollandeâ€™s ideological fuzziness  â€”   dangerous for a politician faced with a French electorate that has historically demanded clarity and authority from its top leader. But it was his failure to make a dent in Franceâ€™s unemployment rate  â€”   much higher than the national figure of 10 percent among youth in some immigrant suburbs, where it approaches 40 percent  â€”   that was perhaps the most decisive blow to his presidency. Months ago, Mr. Hollande suggested that he would not run again if he could not bring it down. He made good on that promise Thursday night. â€œThe major commitment I made to you was to lower the unemployment rate,â€ a melancholy Mr. Hollande said on national television from the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace on Thursday night. â€œAnd I devoted to that, with my government, all of my energy, took all of the risks. â€ â€œI lowered taxes on companies, because thatâ€™s what is needed to create more jobs. I worked to boost hiring, making worker training a top priority,â€ Mr. Hollande said. â€œAnd I took the responsibility to reform the labor market. The results are there  â€”   later than I had said that would be, I admit, but they are there. â€ Actually, though, unemployment has not budged significantly during Mr. Hollandeâ€™s term. Otherwise, his short speech was a dutiful laundry list of the things he said he had accomplished: legalizing   marriage, the Paris climate accord, help for schools, reorganizing Franceâ€™s local governments. It all lacked a defining stamp, as Mr. Hollande himself appeared to recognize. There was a sense of relief in the immediate reactions of his Socialist colleagues. â€œThis was a difficult choice, reflective and serious,â€ Mr. Valls said. â€œI want to express to FranÃ§ois Hollande my emotion, my respect, my loyalty and my affection,â€ Mr. Valls added. He did not announce his own candidacy, but he has been suggesting that he might do so soon. The National Front reacted with glee and mockery to Mr. Hollandeâ€™s decision, even though it is now likely to face a much tougher Socialist opponent next year. â€œIt was smart, smart of FranÃ§ois Hollande,â€ said Florian Philippot, a top National Front official. â€œItâ€™s a good thing for France and the French. It says much about the sense of weariness, the deliquescence, of this term. â€"

21234,Lionel Messi and Argentina Miss Again as Chile Wins Copa AmÃ©rica - The New York Times,Andrew Keh,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N. J.  â€”   Lionel Messi had the collar of his shirt pulled up to his nose. With his eyes peeking out just over the fabric, he watched a nightmare unfold. Argentina and Chile had played 120 minutes of ruthless, scoreless soccer on Sunday night at MetLife Stadium. Penalty kicks would be needed to decide the winner of the 45th Copa AmÃ©rica. Up stepped Messi, widely regarded as the best player in the world, to take the first shot for Argentina, and he missed, sending the ball sailing over the crossbar and into the crowd. Moments later, he watched as Francisco Silva of Chile buried a shot inside the left post to give his team a   shootout win. All of the Argentine players hung their heads near the center circle as the Chileans erupted in celebration. But Messi took a slow, solitary walk across the grass and took a seat on the far end of his teamâ€™s bench. He stared at the grass as the Chilean players bobbed up and down in celebration. When he got up again, there were tears in his eyes. The emotions boiled over, and they carried to the locker room. When Messi, 29,   he suggested, shockingly, that his national team career was over. â€œIn the locker room, I thought that the national team was finished for me, that itâ€™s not for me,â€ Messi said. â€œItâ€™s what I feel right now. Itâ€™s a great sadness that it happened to me, that I missed penalty kick that was very important. Itâ€™s for the good of everybody. Itâ€™s not enough to just get to the final and not win. â€ The meeting of Argentina and Chile in the 45th Copa AmÃ©rica final was eagerly awaited as an alluring confrontation of two of the finest soccer teams in the world. Yet the game that materialized had all the charm and beauty of a street brawl. Faces puckered in pain and anger. Studded cleats whipped dangerously in the air, aimed at flesh. Bodies collided with other bodies, crumpling and splaying onto the grass. Those in the crowd of 82, 026  â€”   the largest soccer crowd in New Jersey history  â€”   who sought a showcase of sophisticated play were instead treated to a stream of crunching tackles, theatrical quarrels, disciplinary cards (eight yellows, two reds). The Chileans, who defeated the Argentines in the same competition last year on Chileâ€™s home soil, will not mind the soreness. Argentina, which has not won a major tournament since 1993, will have a dose of existential despair to accompany the physical pain. Before the tournament, memories of the teamâ€™s most recent heartbreaks weighed heavily on Messiâ€™s mind: the Copa AmÃ©rica in 2007, in which the Argentines lost a second straight final to their archrival, Brazil the World Cup final in 2014, in which they succumbed to Germany in overtime the Copa AmÃ©rica final in 2015, in which they fell to Chile in a penalty shootout. Add 2016, when Chile outlasted them in an unending rumble. â€œItâ€™s incredible, the fact that we canâ€™t win it,â€ Messi said. â€œItâ€™s happened to us again, and by penalty kicks. Itâ€™s our third consecutive final. We tried, and it wasnâ€™t for us. â€ Messi has played 113 times for Argentina. Last week, with his 55th goal, he became his countryâ€™s leading scorer. He has won every award and honor imaginable as an individual and with his club team, Barcelona. But if he does not play another international soccer game, his glittering rÃ©sumÃ© will have one glaring hole: a championship with Argentina. The game on Sunday had a violent start, establishing a fierce tone, and amid the constellation of superstars on both teams, the referee, HÃ©ber Lopes, somehow emerged as the center of attention. The only credible chance of the first half came in the 22nd minute, when Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n chipped his shot wide after finding himself one on one with goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. Otherwise, it was a parade of fouls and cards. Marcelo DÃ­az of Chile picked up a yellow card in the 16th minute for kicking Messi near his midsection. Twelve minutes later, Messi and DÃ­az collided after Messi had prodded the ball into space on another menacing move, and Lopes ran over holding a second yellow card for DÃ­az, reducing Chile to 10 men. Two more yellow cards materialized in the 37th minute, after a momentary kerfuffle between Javier Mascherano of Argentina and Arturo Vidal of Chile. Three minutes later, Messi picked up a yellow card for diving. In the 43rd minute, Marcos Rojo of Argentina was issued a straight red card after a slide tackle on Vidal  â€”   even though the challenge looked more poorly timed than malicious. On good days, Chile is known for its     defense  â€”   a system that can make opposing players feel like fish struggling to swim upstream. Argentina at its best can embroider long stretches of passing with the nonchalance of a knitting circle. But reduced to 10 men apiece, the teams resorted to more rudimentary maneuvers. The Argentines had scored 18 goals in their previous five games, but their strategy on Sunday seemed reduced to having Messi try to dribble through the Chilean defense himself. Chile controlled possession, 54 percent to 46, but was severely outshot,  . Surrounding the referee, trying to sway him to issue cards to opponents, became a part of the tactical framework of the game. The coaches, Gerardo Martino of Argentina and Juan Antonio Pizzi of Chile, were separated on the sideline at one point. Scoring chances emerged as the game wore on, even as playersâ€™ legs grew wobbly, like boxers swaying, seeking a decisive blow, in a   bout. The two goalkeepers traded athletic saves in a span of minutes in overtime. Everyone in the stadium  â€”   the fans, the players, the referee  â€”   seemed exhausted when the game went to penalty kicks. Vidal stepped up first, and his shot was saved by keeper Sergio Romero of Argentina. Then came Messi, who whacked his attempt several yards over the bar. He spent parts of the shootout thereafter on his knees, staring at the ground. Argentinaâ€™s fourth shooter, Lucas Biglia, missed, too, setting up Chileâ€™s decisive kick. Messi watched in despair. â€œThereâ€™s not much analysis to go over,â€ Martino said. â€œWe really had high hopes, and now weâ€™re leaving  . â€ The sellout crowd  â€”   thick with fans of Argentina dressed in light blue and white, speckled throughout with Chile supporters in red  â€”   represented one last mass spectacle to cap a month of entertaining games. In recent days, tournament organizers hailed the success of the event, specially scheduled for the 100th anniversary of the tournament and held for the first time outside South America. For the United States, it was a chance to reiterate its capacity to host a future World Cup. The competition drew an average of 46, 119 people per game, more than any other Copa tournament. Sunil Gulati, the president of U. S. Soccer, last week called those figures â€œWorld Cup numbers, for an event organized in seven months with 16 teams. â€ (The last three World Cups drew averages of 53, 592, 49, 499 and 52, 609 people per game.) The final on Sunday played out under a shadow of scandal, though, with the president of the Argentine Football Association, Luis Segura, and several top soccer officials having been criminally charged in a corruption case in Argentina only three days before the final game. Victor Montagliani, the new president of Concacaf, an organizer of the tournament, said on Sunday that it was something of a miracle that the Copa AmÃ©rica had been successfully carried out at all. The tournament figured prominently in the world soccer corruption case announced by the United States Justice Department last year, requiring the associated contracts for media and marketing rights to be torn up. â€œIt was a bit of a Rubikâ€™s Cube to figure it out,â€ Montagliani said. â€œThis tournament was dead. â€ The tournament survived, but it was anguishing for Messi. On Thursday, after the Argentina team plane was delayed, he criticized the federation on his Instagram account, calling it a â€œdisaster. â€ He frustration only grew as the weekend went on, through a grueling game against Chile, until he apparently had enough and stepped away from the team altogether."
21235,"Assad in Person: Confident, Friendly, No Regrets - The New York Times",Anne Barnard,"DAMASCUS, Syria  â€”   The guns were silent atop Mount Qasioun and the lights on its slopes twinkled over Damascus as President Bashar   of Syria welcomed a group of Western visitors into his   palace on Monday night, presenting himself as a man firmly in control of his country. He radiated confidence and friendliness as he ushered a group of British and American journalists and policy analysts into an elegant   sitting room where he claimed that the social fabric of Syria was stitched together â€œmuch better than beforeâ€ a chaotic civil war began more than five years ago. It was as if half his citizens had not been driven from their homes and nearly half a million had not been killed in the bloody fighting for which he rejected any personal responsibility, blaming instead the United States and Islamist militants. â€œIâ€™m just a headline  â€”   the bad president, the bad guy, who is killing the good guys,â€ Mr. Assad said. â€œYou know this narrative. The real reason is toppling the government. This government doesnâ€™t fit the criteria of the United States. â€ It was a surreal meeting for me after years of writing about a devastating and intractable war that has reduced several of Syriaâ€™s grand city centers to rubble and prompted accusations of war crimes. While hundreds of thousands of Syrians are besieged and hungry, here was Mr. Assad, secure in his palace because he has outsourced much of the war to Russian, Iranian and Hezbollah forces whose influence has grown to a degree that makes some of his own supporters uncomfortable. He was on a mission to convince the West that their governments had made a mistake in backing his opponents and that he was secure in his position as the custodian of Syrian sovereignty. Waxing philosophical, he spoke of every Syrianâ€™s right to be â€œa full citizen, in every meaning of this word,â€ and likened intolerant versions of religion to a computer operating system that needed to be updated. He promised that a new era of openness and dialogue was underway in Syria and said that he was thinking ahead about how to modernize Syriansâ€™ mentality after a war that he believed his forces were assured of winning. Mr. Assad ruled out political changes until then and declared that he planned to remain president at least until his third   term ends in 2021. Even as Mr. Assad and his inner circle tried out this new line of openness about the situation in Syria, they were hardening their stance against compromising with domestic or international opponents. They contended that the United States was actively backing the Islamic State and other extremist militants, and called allegations of war crimes against Syrian officials politically motivated, fabricated or both. Despite â€œthousands of Syrians killed by the terrorists,â€ Mr. Assad asserted, â€œno one is talking about war crimesâ€ by his opponents. In fact, the day before, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, followed by Amnesty International and other international rights groups, condemned the rebel groupsâ€™ indiscriminate shelling of   sections of Aleppo, attacks that have killed scores of civilians in recent days. But it is Syrian government warplanes that have indiscriminately pounded   residential areas daily for years government forces that have imposed starvation sieges and state detention facilities that hold thousands of people  â€”   including peaceful protesters, bloggers and other civilians arrested seemingly at random  â€”   who languish without trial, often under torture. We asked Mr. Assad about these things, of course. â€œLetâ€™s suppose that these allegations are correct and this president has killed his own people, and the free world and the West are helping the Syrian people,â€ Mr. Assad said in English. â€œAfter five years and a half, who supported me? How can I be a president and my people donâ€™t support me?â€ He gave a small giggle and added, â€œThis is not realistic story. â€ Indeed, Mr. Assad has managed to hold on not only because of decisive intervention by foreign fighters, but also because of deeper support in some quarters than many thought he had. Mr. Assad said on Monday that while much of his support came from people who may dislike his policies or the Baath Party he heads, they fear that the alternative would be extremist rule or state collapse. â€œThey learned the value of the state,â€ he said, acknowledging that this support could diminish if the war ends. â€œThatâ€™s what brought them towards us, not because they changed their mind politically. â€ Mr. Assadâ€™s remarks came after a   conference organized by the British Syrian Society, headed by his    Fawaz Akhras, that was billed as part of a new openness and an effort to compete in what has been termed a news media war. I was among several dozen international journalists and analysts who attended the conference as a way to get into the country after more than two years of being unable to obtain a visa. There was no sign that the policy requiring journalists to travel with minders and to go through elaborate hoops to visit specific areas had changed. But Damascus, the capital, appeared less tense than on my last visit, in 2014. New bars are packed in the historic old city. After advances by   forces and what the government calls reconciliation deals with besieged   suburbs, artillery fire no longer pounds those districts daily, and rebel mortar fire hits the city less frequently. The message from government officials and Assad supporters echoed the presidentâ€™s: They believe they are winning and they are ready to engage with the West, but on their own terms. â€œIt is up to the West to rethink about their policies,â€ the Syrian foreign minister, Walid   told a group of us on Monday, adding that the government would welcome, though it did not expect, cooperation from the United States. Mr. Moallem said the government would fight to defeat any militants refusing to return to government rule  â€”   be they Kurdish groups in the northeast, or the   groups and   rebels fighting in Aleppo. He dismissed the possibility of any deal that would retain local opposition control in eastern Aleppo, saying that would â€œreward those murderers. â€ Mr. Assad said during our meeting that â€œuntil this moment, we still have a dialogue through different channels,â€ even to the United States. â€œBut that doesnâ€™t mean to give up our sovereignty and transfer Syria into a puppet country,â€ he added. The confident statements come amid a much more complicated picture. Despite Russian air support and thousands of militia fighters from Iraq and Hezbollah, the governmentâ€™s push to retake the   half of Aleppo  is facing stiff resistance and counterattacks. The Syrian pound is worth   of its prewar value against the dollar. Millions of Syrian children are unable to attend school. The Islamic State still holds large swaths of Syria. Mr. Assad, in a dark suit and trademark   tie, met us at the top of the palaceâ€™s sweeping staircase, saying he found it â€œmore cozyâ€ than the official one. There were no security checks. Hanging in the grand entryway was a painting of a distorted, grimacing figure, a signature work by the Syrian artist Sabhan Adam, who draws inspiration for his â€œhuman monsters,â€ his website says, from â€œthe pain, fear and phobia which our society constantly suffers from. â€ Mr. Assad joked about his love of technology  â€”   â€œI follow the gadgets on a daily basisâ€  â€”   and noted with pride that 4G mobile phone technology had been introduced in Syria during the war. But he brushed off reports that he loved video games. â€œThe last video game I played was Atari,â€ he said. â€œSpace Invaders. â€ Pressed on how Syria might be restructured or reformed, he said the first change needed was in its mental â€œoperating system,â€ which he said was based on religion. Ideologies based on â€œbad interpretationâ€ of Islam had fueled the war, he said, rejecting analystsâ€™ contentions that his government had accelerated the process by building mosques and funneling jihadist fighters to Iraq during the United States occupation. â€œIslamization means â€˜I donâ€™t believe in anyone who doesnâ€™t look like me, behaves like me, thinks like me,â€™ â€ he said. â€œSecular means freedom of religion. â€ He denied the existence of political prisoners and grew steely when asked about people detained for protesting or writing against the government. â€œIf you support the terrorists, itâ€™s not political prisoner,â€ he added. â€œYou are supporting the killers. â€ He said that he had released tens of thousands of prisoners through amnesties to pave the way for â€œany solution in our societyâ€ but that he had the authority to release only those who had been tried and sentenced. Asked about specific detainees whose families have heard nothing of them for years, he demanded proof, saying: â€œDo you have documents? Did they see them in prison?â€ Mr. Assad said he was fighting to preserve state institutions and criticized Western intervention. â€œGood government or bad, itâ€™s not your missionâ€ to change it, he said."
21236,Opioid Prescribing Gets Another Look as F.D.A. Revisits Mandatory Doctor Training - The New York Times,Barry Meier,"A pain management specialist, Dr. Nathaniel Katz, was stunned in 2012 when the Food and Drug Administration rejected a recommendation from an expert panel that had urged mandatory training for doctors who prescribed powerful painkillers like OxyContin. That panel had concluded that the training might help stem the epidemic of overdose deaths involving prescription narcotics, or opioids. At first, Dr. Katz, who had been on the panel, thought that drug makers had pressured the F. D. A. to kill the proposal. Then an agency official told him that another group had fought the recommendation: the American Medical Association, the nationâ€™s largest doctors organization. â€œI was shocked,â€ said Dr. Katz, the president of Analgesic Solutions, a company in Natick, Mass. â€œYou go to medical school to help public health and here we have an area where you have 15, 000 people a year dying. â€ Now, as the White House, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal and state agencies scramble to find solutions to the vexing opioid problem, the role of doctors is coming back to center stage. The Obama administration recently announced that it supported mandatory training for prescribers of opioids. On Tuesday, a new F. D. A. panel of outside experts will meet to review once again whether such training should be required. The hearing will almost certainly touch off an intense debate inside the medical community and focus attention on medical groups like the A. M. A. which have resisted governmental mandates affecting how doctors practice for both ideological and practical reasons. The panel is expected to make its final recommendation on Wednesday. An F. D. A. spokeswoman said the agency now supported mandatory training. Since 2012, the F. D. A. has required drug companies that produce     opioids  â€”   drugs like OxyContin, fentanyl and methadone  â€”   to underwrite voluntary educational courses on the medications. In a surprise, last week many of those manufacturers  came out in support of rules requiring doctors to have specific training or expertise in pain management before getting a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe a strong opioid. The approach, which would require congressional action, would ensure that prescribers got â€œappropriate training in pain management with opioids so their patients can continue to access treatment options,â€ the group said. Dr. Patrice A. Harris, who is the chairwoman of the A. M. A. â€™s Task Force to Reduce Opioid Abuse, said the organization was committed to helping doctors better use opioids. But Dr. Harris added that the A. M. A. continued to oppose mandatory opioid training for doctors because many physicians do not prescribe the drugs. She added that the group also opposed laws that require doctors to check databases before issuing a prescription for a narcotic painkiller. Such laws, which a growing number of states have adopted, are intended to help doctors identify patients who seek prescriptions from multiple physicians and to help doctors avoid prescribing dangerous combinations of drugs. Data shows that when such programs are voluntary, many doctors do not use them. â€œWe know these tools are a great tool in the toolbox,â€ said Dr. Harris, who is a psychiatrist. â€œBut they are not a panacea. â€ Doctors say measures like checking prescription databases take up more time in days already filled with bureaucratic duties, and many express ideological concerns about governmentâ€™s reach into medicine. And experts say many doctors believe that their practices and their patients are not responsible for the opioid problem. Timothy Condon, a former official at the  National Institute on Drug Abuse, said he encountered that attitude in 2010 when several federal agencies approached the A. M. A. and medical groups representing specialists to seek their support for mandatory physician training. â€œThe   message was, who are you as feds to tell us how to practice medicine, you already regulate us so much,â€ said Mr. Condon, who is now a research professor at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. He added that when he countered that the scale of the prescriptions that doctors were writing for opioids was central to the overdose problem, the response from the medical group was â€œsilence. â€ Mandatory training before prescribing the drugs is not the only area where government officials and medical experts are cautiously circling each other. The Obama administration has asked American medical schools to incorporate new recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how to treat pain into their curriculums. Along with urging physicians to try nondrug approaches first, the guidelines suggest that opioids be used sparingly. So far, however, only about   of the 145 teaching institutions that belong to a major organization, the Association of American Medical Colleges, have agreed to incorporate the C. D. C. guidelines into their programs. Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, the organizationâ€™s president, said his group and medical schools were actively working to reduce inappropriate opioid use. But he added that many institutions preferred to develop teaching guidelines based on their own expertise. In addition, Dr. Kirch said that medical school leaders feared that committing to one federal guideline could lead to a situation where lawmakers imposed agendas on physicians that are not in the interest of patient care. Last week, the F. D. A. released data showing the impact of a voluntary approach to educating doctors. The figures showed that only about half of the 80, 000 doctors who the agency had hoped would receive training by March 2015 had completed it. While the agency said the results â€œmake it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the successâ€ of the program, it also raised concerns that requiring training could make it harder for patients to get needed drugs. The F. D. A. will also ask the panel to review whether doctors who prescribe     narcotics like Percocet or Vicodin should have access to training. The medical community is not monolithic in its views. Recently, for example, the Massachusetts Medical Society supported legislation in that state imposing a limit on an initial opioid prescription to a   supply. Some doctors and dentists give patients 60 or 90   painkillers, enough for a month, giving rise to potential misuse of the drugs or opening a door to addiction. Dr. Katz, the pain expert in Massachusetts, said he understood the resistance of physicians to mandates, including the fear that malpractice lawyers will seek to wield them as weapons. But he has been urging regulators for about 15 years to require doctors to undergo mandatory training. â€œThere is incredible rationalizing that exists,â€ he said. â€œThere is a problem, and patients and doctors are a part of it. But doctors think it is not me and it is not my patients. â€"

You are fakes, frauds, phonies and criminals. Now that you're out, stay out and don't come back. by Geoffrey Grider November 10, 2016 Donald Trump single-handedly took down the entire corrupt wing of the Republican Party 
Donald Trumpâ€™s run for the presidency over the past year and a half revealed some amazing things, it flushed out the rats that had hijacked the Republican Party like the Bush Crime Family and others. While George W. Bush declared that he and his wife Laura â€œ would not be voting in this election â€œ, his father George H.W. Bush actually voted for Crooked Hillary Clinton . (If youâ€™d like a cheat sheet of the rest of the Republirats who jumped ship, click here .) 
Why did many of the pretend Republicans not vote for Donald Trump? Because they are part of the New World Order elite globalists, and they could not possibly support Trumpâ€™s America First agenda. The Bush Crime Family, after 28 years of corrupting the GOP, was finally exposed to the sunlight and what an ugly sight it was. For more information on this topic,please read NTEBâ€™s The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories That Were Proven To Be True Because Donald Trump Ran For President . If you are just hearing about this for the first time, it will be an eye-opener. 
The GOP is frequently referred to as the â€œparty of Reaganâ€ , but thatâ€™s not really a true statement. It used to be the party of Ronald Reagan after the 1980 revolution , but shortly after Reaganâ€™s term ended it was hijacked by the Bush Crime family. For over twenty years now, the Republican Party has been a festering witches cabal of New World Order elites and Bohemian Grove acolytes. The Bush Crime Family â€“ Three Generations of Treason 
The November 1989 edition of SPY magazine featured photos of Bohemian Grove men dancing around dressed up as women . The article included artist renditions of the Moloch idol and discussed how they bus in male prostitutes and how AIDS is a big problem. In July of 2004, a New York Post article reported how a top gay-porn star, Chad Savage, serviced the moguls at the Bohemian Grove. Bigwigs who have attended the two-week retreat include George H.W.

A Brief History Of Molech, the Owl, the Bushes and the Bohemian Grove: 
The corrupt liberal media all said in lockstep that Donald Trump will â€œ destroy the Republican party â€œ, but it was only a half-true statement. All the people who defected when Trump was nominated were people who needed to be expunged from the Grand Old Party of Lincoln and Reagan.

21241,A Jewish Reporter Got to Ask Trump a Question. It Didnâ€™t Go Well. - The New York Times,Laurie Goodstein,"Jake Turx is a newly minted White House correspondent for a publication that has never before had a seat in the White House press corps: Ami Magazine, an Orthodox Jewish weekly based in Brooklyn. He is a singular presence in the briefing room: a young Hasidic Jew with side curls tucked behind his ears and a skullcap embroidered with his Twitter handle. When President Trump called on him at a news conference on Thursday, saying he was looking for a â€œfriendly reporter,â€ Mr. Turx was prepared. He had spent an hour crafting a question about a recent surge of   with a preamble that he hoped would convey his supportive disposition toward Mr. Trump. But the exchange did not go the way he expected. A few hours later, with the clip replaying on social media and Jewish groups issuing news releases, Mr. Turx, 30, was still reeling. He said in a telephone interview, â€œRegretfully, today was a day I wish we could have done over. â€ His editor, Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter, watched aghast from the magazineâ€™s offices as his young correspondent received a   from the president: â€œIt was a very disheartening moment for us, to watch him being berated. â€ The exchange began with Mr. Turx standing up from his   seat and gesturing slightly toward his fellow reporters: â€œDespite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I havenâ€™t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being  . We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren. You are their zayde,â€ which is Yiddish for â€œgrandfatherâ€ and often a word of great affection. At that Mr. Trump nodded slightly, and said, â€œthank you. â€ â€œHowever,â€ Mr. Turx continued, â€œwhat we are concerned about and what we havenâ€™t really heard being addressed is an uptick in   and how the government is planning to take care of it. Thereâ€™s been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people committing   acts or threatening to â€”   â€”  â€ At that, Mr. Trump interrupted, saying it was â€œnot a fair question. â€ â€œSit down,â€ the president commanded. â€œI understand the rest of your question. â€ As Mr. Turx took his seat, Mr. Trump said, â€œSo hereâ€™s the story, folks. No. 1, I am the least   person that youâ€™ve ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism, the least racist person. â€ Mr. Turx tried to interject, realizing how the encounter had turned. He said he had wanted to clarify that he in no way meant to accuse Mr. Trump of   but instead intended to ask what his administration could do to stop the   incidents. But Mr. Trump would not let him speak again, saying, â€œQuiet, quiet, quiet. â€ As Mr. Turx shook his head with an incredulous look on his face, Mr. Trump accused him of having lied that his question would be straight and simple. Mr. Trump said, â€œI find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me.   â€¦    â€ He went on to say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, during his visit to the United States on Wednesday, had vouched for Mr. Trump as a good friend of Israel and the Jewish people and no  . Mr. Trump concluded that Mr. Turx should have relied on Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s endorsement, â€œinstead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. â€ â€œJust shows you about the press, but thatâ€™s the way the press is,â€ Mr. Trump said. At the news conference, Mr. Turx was referring to a rash of incidents that have shaken many American Jews since Mr. Trump was elected. On three separate days in January, Jewish synagogues, community centers and schools across the country received what seemed to be a coordinated wave of telephone bomb threats that led to evacuations and F. B. I. investigations. Other Jewish institutions have seen an uptick in vandalism and graffiti in the last few months. It was the second time in two days that Mr. Trump was asked to denounce   and offer American Jews a dose of reassurance. In his joint news conference with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump responded to a question about   by breezily recounting the size of his Electoral College victory and then reminding the reporters that his daughter, Ivanka, his    Jared Kushner, and their three children  â€”   Mr. Trumpâ€™s grandchildren  â€”   are all Jewish.

Many Jews have been critical of Mr. Trump for not more forcefully denouncing   and racists like David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan who endorsed Mr. Trump during the campaign. Many Jewish leaders are also wary of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumpâ€™s White House strategist, because of the close affinity between Breitbart News, which he once ran, and the white supremacists in the movement known as the  . On Friday, the leaders of Reform Judaism, which includes more than a third of American Jews and is the largest stream of American Judaism, announced that they opposed the confirmation of David M.

The leaders said in a statement that Mr. Friedman, who has supported Israeli settlements in the West Bank, was unqualified, intemperate and held â€œextreme viewsâ€ on Israel that will endanger â€œboth American and Israeli security. â€ Mr. Trump was popular among many Orthodox Jews. They were reassured to see the Orthodox Jews in his family and attracted to his hawkish line on Israel, his support of vouchers for religious schools and his promise to ban Muslim immigrants from entering the country.

21242,"Hillary â€œattack dogâ€ David Brock plotting with Soros, Steyer, Sussman to â€œkick Trumpâ€™s assâ€",Tyler Durden,"VIDEOS Hillary â€œattack dogâ€ David Brock plotting with Soros, Steyer, Sussman to â€œkick Trumpâ€™s assâ€ If there is one thing that is missing from the most scandalous political election in recent history, it is an attempt to physically eliminate the president By Tyler Durden - Friday, November 18, 2016 9:42 AM EST 
The last time we encountered David Brock , Hillary Clintonâ€™s so called media â€œattack dogâ€, was two months ago when we exposed a money laundering scheme involving over a dozen of his Pro-Clinton SuperPACs. Now, it appears that unable to concede defeat, the man who aligned his career with Hillary Clinton, is going for blood, and is soliciting the help, but mostly money, of Clintonâ€™s top donors. 
According to Politico , Brock is launching his own Koch-brothers-like donor network to finance attacks on President-elect Donald Trump and to rebuild the political left after Trumpâ€™s stunning victory over Clinton last week. In an email sent out on Thursday night, Brock emailed more than 200 of the biggest donors on the left, including finance titans George Soros, Tom Steyer and Donald Sussman all of whom invested millions of dollars in Clintonâ€™s campaign with nothing to show for it, inviting them to a private retreat in Palm Beach during inauguration weekend to assess what Democrats did wrong in 2016, figure out how to correct it and raise cash for those initiatives. 
â€œ This will be THE gathering for Democratic donors from across the country to hear from a broad and diverse group of leaders about the next steps for progressives under a Trump Administration ,â€ Brock wrote to the donors in an email. â€œWhat better way to spend inaugural weekend than talking about how to kick Donald Trumpâ€™s ass?â€ Brock said. The retreat, which is planned as the first in a series of regular gatherings, will feature appearances by an array of Democratic elected officials, operatives and liberal thinkers and group officials, Brock explained in an interview. 
While it is unclear how many of the addressed billionaires confirmed their presence at this â€œsecretâ€ gathering, Brock predicted there would be significant interest, noting that the keynote address at his last major donor conference, back in 2013, was delivered by former President Bill Clinton. It is unclear how much Clinton received for one hours of his time. 
Brock is a self-described â€œright-wing hitman-turned-Clinton enforcer â€ who has used his relationships with some of the leftâ€™s wealthiet supporters and billionaire donors to build an armada of aggressive political outfits that have become pillars of the institutional left and that raised a combined $65 million during the 2016 cycle. As profiled previously, Brockâ€™s groups include the conservative media monitoring non-profit Media Matters, the opposition research super PAC American Bridge and the legal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. 
Thatâ€™s not all: other groups in his network include the liberal media-funding vehicle American Independent Institute, the media-training non-profit Franklin Forum and the for-profit social media operation ShareBlue, which The New York Times described as â€œHillary Clintonâ€™s Outrage Machine.â€ A seventh group, a super PAC called Correct the Record that was created to coordinate directly with Clintonâ€™s campaign , is winding down, though Brock said that a number of its functions and personnel likely will be absorbed by his other groups. 
And yet one wonders if Brockâ€™s attempt to square things up with Trump isnâ€™t too little, too late, especially for a many who like Huma Abedin, has been so closely associated with Hillary and her now defunct political career: Brock acknowledged in the interview: â€œThere is no question that we poured our heart and soul into this election for Hillary, but these institutions were built before her campaign and were intended to outlast it.â€ 
To separate himself from the Clintons whom he serves so well over the years, Brock said in his email to donors that he created Media Matters more than a decade ago to help the left push back during George W. Bushâ€™s presidency. 
â€œIn 2005, we were part of a successful progressive effort to regroup, retool and recover,â€ he wrote. â€œWhile todayâ€™s situation is more dire, media matters more than ever.â€ 
But the biggest problem for Brock is that he is likely stepping on the very toes of those whose money he is after: as Politico notes, the Palm Beach retreat seems to be a challenge to the 12-year-old Democracy Alliance, a club of liberal financiers that was started by Soros and a handful of other major donors to fund the institutional left . In fact, the club, which held its annual winter meeting this week in Washington, helped launch Media Matters, and many of Brockâ€™s donors belong to its ranks. Brock said heâ€™s inviting the president of the DA, as the club is known, to his Palm Beach retreat. 
There is one way Brockâ€™s network hopes to differentiate itself: while the Democracy Alliance at its winter meeting discussed ways to push back on the Trump administration, many of the groupâ€™s members have tried to train its focus on pressuring Democrats from the left on issues like fighting climate change, money in politics and drug laws; Brock however is more overtly and aggressively political, and has been â€œlargely agnostic on the philosophical divisions with which Democrats are grappling.â€ 
â€œWe donâ€™t think of this as representing a faction of the Democratic Party, but a cross-section of it, so weâ€™re not going to precook things ideologically,â€ he said. â€œIt is very politically minded, and there is an urgency to it.â€ 
At this point two questions emerge: one of the main reasons why Clinton lost is precisely due to behind the scenes scheming such as this, where political â€œattack dogâ€ operatives would meet with billionaires and strategize how to shift public perception on any number of items. That has now been proven to be a losing strategy. Have the democrats truly not learned anything from their most shocking failure in history? 
The next question is just how much more â€œovertly and aggressively politicalâ€ will Brock, whose organizations have been alleged to be behind a number of the anti-Trump riots in recent months, be in his quest to take down, or rather â€œkick the assâ€ of Donald Trump.

21244,Trump Lines Up Establishment Republicans to Vouch for Rex Tillerson - The New York Times,Michael D. Shear,"WASHINGTON  â€”   After waging an   assault on the Republican establishment,   Donald J. Trump changed course on Tuesday and enlisted the partyâ€™s high priests of foreign policy to help him win the confirmation of Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state. Several former Republican secretaries of defense and state sought to dismiss bipartisan concerns about Mr. Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil chief executive, over his   relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At the center of the debate are questions about Mr. Tillersonâ€™s vocal opposition to American sanctions imposed on Russia as he pursued oil and gas deals in that country. Their mobilization showed how much Mr. Tillersonâ€™s nomination is already a Congressional proxy fight over Mr. Trumpâ€™s embrace of Russia and Mr. Putin. Democrats issued blunt denunciations of the idea that a   energy executive could adequately represent the national interests of the United States. So did several leading Republicans, whose party orthodoxy has been   for decades. â€œI have serious concerns about his nomination,â€ said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, declared himself â€œdeeply troubledâ€ by Mr. Tillersonâ€™s opposition to sanctions imposed by the United States on Russia after its intervention in Ukraine in 2014. Democrats and liberal activists also expressed deep concern about the fate of human rights and climate change under a State Department led by Mr. Tillerson, a   veteran of the countryâ€™s largest oil company. At the other end of the political spectrum, social conservatives condemned him for playing a role in reversing the Boy Scoutsâ€™ longstanding policy of excluding gay people, an issue that became a cultural flashpoint for the religious right. And when he faces lawmakers during hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Tillerson will almost certainly be grilled about his finances, his tax returns and his personal investments  â€”   questions that Mr. Trump managed to largely avoid answering about himself during his presidential campaign. â€œRex Tillersonâ€™s philosophy on international religious freedom, Middle East instability, foreign assistance and relations with countries like Russia and China must be closely examined before confirmation,â€ Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said on Tuesday in a statement on Facebook. Mr. Trumpâ€™s effort to counter those concerns began early Tuesday morning, almost immediately after his Twitter message making the nomination official: â€œI have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State,â€ he posted at 6:43 a. m. A series of statements followed from former Vice President Dick Cheney and former secretaries of state James A. Baker III and Condoleezza Rice, among others. In an interview, Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of defense under President Obama and President George W. Bush, strongly endorsed Mr. Tillerson, a longtime friend, calling him someone who â€œknows the world like the back of his hand. â€ Mr. Gates, whose consulting firm has represented Exxon Mobil, said that senators concerned about Mr. Tillersonâ€™s relationship with Mr. Putin are basing their criticism â€œon a superficial watchingâ€ of video clips of the Exxon executive receiving the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013 with Mr. Putin. Mr. Gates said he recommended Mr. Tillerson to the   because he is someone with decades of experience negotiating with foreign leaders. â€œI think itâ€™s a mistake to confuse having a friendly relationship based on business with sympathy or friendship,â€ said Mr. Gates, who acknowledged in an earlier statement that Exxon has been a client. â€œI think Rex is a   realist, and I think he will absolutely put Americaâ€™s interests first in any negotiation. â€ During the 2016 primary campaign, Mr. Trump often railed against a Republican establishment that he accused of trying to prevent him from becoming president. On Tuesday, his transition staff proudly released statements of support for Mr. Tillerson that included some of his fiercest critics, including Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida who fought a losing battle for the partyâ€™s presidential nomination. Mr. Gates had written one of the most scathing statements, writing in a Wall Street Journal   article in September that â€œa   temperamental,     and lip, uninformed    is too great a risk for America. â€ Mr. Trumpâ€™s willingness to embrace the very establishment that he once scorned is partly a reflection of the difficulty that Mr. Tillerson faces in his confirmation battle. Over the past several days, Republican and Democratic lawmakers warned that Mr. Tillerson would face intense scrutiny about his relationship with Russia and with Mr. Putin. Mr. Tillerson has been publicly skeptical about Russian sanctions, which have halted some of Exxonâ€™s biggest projects in Russia, including an agreement with the state oil company to explore and pump underground resources in Siberia that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. Democrats seized on Mr. Tillersonâ€™s background as the leader of an oil company to raise doubts about his commitment to environmental issues. A native of Wichita Falls, Tex. who speaks with a strong Texan twang, Mr. Tillerson, 64, runs a company with operations in about 50 countries, and has cut deals to expand businesses in Venezuela, Qatar, Kurdistan and elsewhere. â€œHe and other company executives led Exxon Mobil in funding outside groups to create an illusion of scientific uncertainty around the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change,â€ Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, said in a statement. Ms. Tanden, who has been a longtime confidante of Hillary Clinton, added, â€œThis   misinformation campaign directly narrowed the worldâ€™s window of opportunity to cut emissions and avert the catastrophic effects of climate change. â€ Amnesty International said in a statement that â€œRex Tillersonâ€™s nomination is deeply troubling and could undermine human rights in the U. S. and abroad. â€ A former national president for the Boy Scouts, Mr. Tillerson was involved in opening the Scouts up to gay scouts and leaders. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, wrote on his organizationâ€™s website that Mr. Tillerson â€œcaved to the pressure of the far left, irreparably splitting the Scouts and destroying a proud and honorable American tradition. â€ Mr. Perkins also cited Exxonâ€™s financial donations to Planned Parenthood, calling them â€œupsetting at best. â€ Mr. Trump appeared unfazed by the potential roadblocks to Mr. Tillersonâ€™s confirmation. In his statement making official his decision to nominate Mr. Tillerson, the   lavished praise on the Exxon executive for his business acumen and knowledge of the world. â€œHis tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for secretary of state,â€ Mr. Trump said. â€œRex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none. â€ Mr. Tillerson said in the statement that he shared Mr. Trumpâ€™s vision for â€œrestoring the credibility of the United Statesâ€™ foreign relations,â€ and he vowed to â€œfocus on strengthening our alliances, pursuing shared national interests and enhancing the strength, security and sovereignty of the United States. â€ Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who was a finalist to become Mr. Trumpâ€™s secretary of state and will oversee confirmation hearings as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued an enthusiastic statement. â€œMr. Tillerson is a very impressive individual and has an extraordinary working knowledge of the world,â€ Mr. Corker said. â€œI congratulate him on his nomination and look forward to meeting with him and chairing his confirmation hearing. â€"
21245,Installing a Torture Fan at CIA,Consortiumnews.com,"Installing a Torture Fan at CIA November 19, 2016 
Exclusive: The CIAâ€™s torturers can breathe a sigh of relief after President-elect Trump tapped a defender of â€œenhanced interrogation techniquesâ€ to become CIA director, writes ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern. 
By Ray McGovern 
  Trumpâ€™s selection of Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo, an open aficionado of torture practices used in the â€œwar on terror,â€ to be CIA director shows that Trump was serious when he said he would support â€œwaterboarding and much worse.â€ 
Earlier, there had been a sliver of hope that that, while on the campaign trail, Trump was simply playing to the basest instincts of many Americans who have been brainwashed â€“ by media, politicians, and the CIA itself â€“ into believing that torture â€œworks.â€ The hope was that the person whom Trump would appoint to head the agency would disabuse him regarding both the efficacy and the legality of torture. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas. 
But such advice is not likely from Pompeo, who has spoken out against the closing of CIAâ€™s â€œblack sitesâ€ used for torture and has criticized the requirement that interrogators adhere to anti-torture laws. He has also opposed closing the prison at Guantanamo, which has become infamous for torture and even murder. 
After visiting Guantanamo three years ago, where many prisoners were on a hunger strike, Pompeo commented, â€œIt looked to me like a lot of them had put on weight.â€ 
There is little doubt that the champagne was flowing on Friday at CIA headquarters, from the seventh-floor executive offices down to the bowels of that building where torture practitioners have been shielded from accountability for 15 years in what amounts to the CIAâ€™s internal â€œwitness protectionâ€ program. 
Indeed, relief over the Pompeo appointment came in the nick of time. For one fleeting moment earlier in the week, there was some panic at the hint that the International Criminal Court might show more courage than President Barack Obama in bringing torture perpetrators to justice. 
That suggestion caused a moment of angst up and down the CIAâ€™s ladder of authority, from supervisory felons, such as Director John Brennan and agency lawyers, down to the thugs hired to implement the amateurish but gruesome regime of torture depicted in gory detail in the Senate Intelligence Committee investigative report , 
Published in December 2014 and based on original CIA documents, the reportâ€™s Executive Summary revealed a range of gruesome practices from the near-drowning sensation of water-boarding to the forcible rectal feeding of detainees. 
Pompeoâ€™s Defense 
Pompeo responded to the findings by personally attacking Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein. He claimed she had â€œput American lives at riskâ€ and he called CIA participants in the torture program â€œheroes, not pawns in some liberal game being played by the ACLU and Senator Feinstein.â€ Former Rep. Pete Hoekstra (left) argues with ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern about the Senate torture report on CCTV Americaâ€™s â€œThe Heatâ€ on Dec. 11, 2014. (Screenshot from program) 
Pompeo seemed to be taking his cue from former chair of the House Intelligence Committee Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, who, right after the Senate report was released, boasted to me on live TV that he had been briefed on â€œ90 to 95 percentâ€ of the cruel practices laid bare in the Senate investigation. [See Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ Clashing Face to Face on Torture .â€ 
Torture also has its supporters in the Senate, which will be called on to confirm Pompeo as CIA director. At a Senate hearing on May 13, 2009, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, gave a tip of the cap to the Spanish Inquisition, which he cited as proof that torture could elicit some useful confessions (as it was used in the Fifteenth Century to detect â€œcrypto Jewsâ€ and to burn several thousand heretics at the stake). 
During a hearing on detainee interrogations, Sen. Graham said : â€œLetâ€™s have both sides of the story here,â€ pointing out that there could be evidence that torture produced â€œgood information.â€ Graham added, â€œI mean, one of the reasons these techniques have survived for about 500 years is apparently they work.â€ 
On Wednesday, I was given nine minutes on radio to comment on the ICCâ€™s tentative move to seek accountability for American torture practices. But Pompeoâ€™s nomination on Friday is sure to dispel the brief moment of anxiety among the CIAâ€™s torturers. 
Congressman Pompeo is living proof that you can get all Aâ€™s at West Point, graduate first in your class, and still flunk the Constitution with its quaint Eighth Amendment prohibition against â€œcruel and unusual punishment.â€ Not knowing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights apparently makes you a good pick to head the CIA. 
As member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), Pompeo also was protective of the National Security Agencyâ€™s systematic abuse of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s prohibition against illegal searches and seizures. 
The selection of Pompeo came a few days after Vice President-elect Mike Pence told ABC that he would model his handling of the job after former Vice President Dick Cheney under President George W. Bush. 
Though Pence may have meant Cheneyâ€™s assertive role and interaction with Congress, there was also Cheneyâ€™s advocacy for â€œregime changeâ€ wars and what the Bush administration called â€œenhanced interrogation techniques,â€ which earned Cheney the label from The Washington Post, â€œVice President for Torture.â€ 
Cheney has never been repentant about his aggressiveness in the â€œwar on terror.â€ â€œIâ€™d do it again in a minute,â€ he has declared . 
Real Expert on Torture 
Yet, even as Bush-Cheney apologists found excuses and euphemisms for torture, Gen. John Kimmons, head of Army Intelligence, told a Pentagon press conference on Sept. 6, 2006 â€“ the same day he knew that President Bush planned to advertise the efficacy of his â€œalternate set of proceduresâ€ â€“ that torture did not result in sound information. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) 
Conceding past â€œtransgressions and mistakes,â€ Kimmons insisted: â€œNo good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices. I think history tells us that. I think the empirical evidence of the last five years, hard years, tells us that.â€ (Emphasis added) 
Thatâ€™s also what I learned as a young Army Intelligence officer 50 years ago. Cheney, Hoekstra, Graham, Trump, Pence and Pompeo can keep whistling on the dark side, but there is zero evidence to challenge what Gen. Kimmons had to guts to point out on that important day. The Senate Intelligence Committee report of December 2014 should have long since laid to rest the canard that torture â€œworks.â€ 
On a moral level, I also cannot quite fathom the attitude of Pence â€“ who says, â€œIâ€™m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that orderâ€ â€“ tolerating torture and torture advocates. If memory serves, Jesus Christ was tortured to death. 
Lest I seem to be coming down too hard on how so many fundamentalist Christians wink at (or applaud) torture, I must concede that â€“ after 9/11 â€“ the growing acceptance of practices like torture, previously widely condemned as totally unacceptable behavior, gained willing acceptance among many non-fundamentalist Christians, as well. 
Many years ago when I studied ethics at Fordham, New York Cityâ€™s Jesuit university, I was taught that there was one immutable category called â€œintrinsic evil,â€ which included slavery, rape and torture. 
Somehow, torture slid out of that category when Fordhamâ€™s president, Rev. Joseph M. McShane, SJ, succumbed to the â€œcelebrity virus,â€ and decided to ask alumnus (then-White House aide on counterterrorism and now CIA Director) John Brennan to give the Commencement address in 2012. 
Brennan had publicly defended the practice of extraordinary rendition (aka kidnaping, most often for torture). Brennan was also on the routing for emails regarding CIA torture procedures. (It is important to note that, without a demonstrated â€œneed to know,â€ no one is included as an addressee on such delicate matters.) 
Adding insult to the injury of giving Brennan such an important invitation, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in â€œHumane Lettersâ€ (what might seem like a sick joke), as fellow honoree, Timothy Cardinal Dolan, Archbishop of New York, applauded from the same platform. 
When a number of graduating seniors objected to this profaning of their graduation, President McShane gave a glib gloss on torture and drone killings in these words: â€œWe donâ€™t live in a black and white world; we live in a gray world.â€ 
(A group that I helped found, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, has written a number of Memoranda on torture and most recently on the CIAâ€™s cover-up of torture , an issue completely neglected in the corporate media.)

21246,Trump: â€˜Iâ€™m a Nationalist and a Globalistâ€™ - Breitbart,Penny Starr,"On the eve of the 100 days in office milestone, President Donald Trump claims he is both a nationalist and a globalist  â€”   despite campaign promises that his presidency would reject globalism and put America first. [â€œHey, Iâ€™m a nationalist and a globalist,â€ Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. â€œIâ€™m both. â€  â€œAnd Iâ€™m the only one who makes the decision, believe me,â€ Trump said. But Trump also said that he would terminate NAFTA â€œif weâ€™re unable to make a deal, but hopefully we wonâ€™t have to do that. â€ Trumpâ€™s remarks come as debate swirls around his presidential campaign promise to end the North America Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA in contrast to his recent assertion that he will â€œnegotiateâ€ a revision of the treaty that has guided U. S. trade policy with Mexico and Canada since 1994. The Journal reported that Trump received almost    calls from Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Following those conversations Trump said, â€œTheyâ€™re serious about it and I will negotiate rather than terminate. â€ â€œMeanwhile, Sonny Perdue â€”  the agriculture secretary who took office two days earlier â€”  and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with Mr. Trump and showed him a map indicating the states where jobs would be lost if the pact collapsed, according to a person familiar with the matter,â€ the Journal reported, noting that many of the states on the map supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. â€œThose conversations, along with a flood of calls to the White House from business executives, helped steer Mr. Trump away from an idea that some of his own advisers feared was a rash and unnecessary threat to two trading partners who fully expected to renegotiate the agreement anyway,â€ the Journal reported. â€œI expect the administration to closely consult with Congress before such major   decisions are made,â€ said Sen. Orrin Hatch ( ) chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade. â€œWithdrawing from NAFTA would have significant effects on the America economy. â€ Following Trumpâ€™s election in November, Chriss Street penned a commentary for Breitbart News focused on how Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€ message would strike a blow to â€œworld socialism. â€ â€œThe election of Donald Trump now represents an existential threat to World Socialism across the planet,â€ Street wrote. â€œSocialists know that when President Reagan went rogue with his muscular capitalist policies, communism quickly imploded. Trump has already torn up the   Partnership, which would have internationalized the law covering $28 trillion in trade and investment, about 40 percent of global GDP. â€œTrump seems determined to destroy â€œSocialist Globalizationâ€ with the same capitalist tax cuts and regulatory relief that President Reagan used to destroy communism,â€ Street wrote. In an interview with conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham last month, former presidential candidate and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan said abandoning his populist economic message would be â€œfatalâ€ for Trumpâ€™s presidency."

Devin Nunes announced Wednesday that members of President Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team, including the   were â€œincidentallyâ€ surveilled by the intelligence community, additional names of the transition team were â€œunmasked,â€ and that the information was not obtained in relation to Russia. [Nunes recalled his recent confirmation that information on members of the Trump transition team had been incidentally collected by the intelligence community on numerous occasions. â€œDetails about U. S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. â€  â€œThird, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked,â€ said Nunes. When later asked by reporters if the President was also included in the incidental collection of information, Nunes replied, â€œYes. â€ In response to another reporter, Nunes said â€œitâ€™s possibleâ€ that Trumpâ€™s personal communication was collected.

The representativeâ€™s fourth point was emphatic, â€œ  â€¦    none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team. â€ He made clear that the House Intelligence Committee will investigate surveillance of Trump associates and subsequent dissemination of information gathered. He stated that the goal is to determine: Who was aware of it, Why it was not disclosed to Congress, Who requested and authorized the additional unmasking, Whether anyone directed the intelligence community to focus on Trump associates, Whether any laws, regulations, or procedures were violated, Nunes said that he believes the collection was done legally, but questions remain as to unmasking and the dissemination list of information collected during the transition during the months of November, December, and January. Rep. Nunes characterized the information that was collected as â€œA lot of it appears like it was  â€¦    it was essentially a lot of information on the   and his transition team and what they were doing. â€ He said he has asked the Directors of FBI, NSA, and CIA to â€œexpeditiously complyâ€ with his March 15 letter and provide a full account of such surveillance activities. Nunes called the NSA very, very helpful. He expects additional information to come on Friday. Rep. Nunes said he has not seen any information that has anything to do with Russia or the Russian investigation.

21251,Washington D.C. Insider Says Obama Might Disclose UFO Truth Before January 2017,Lance Schuttler,"Washington D.C. Insider Says Obama Might Disclose UFO Truth Before January 2017 Nov 18, 2016 6 0 
Steven Basset is the only registered UFO disclosure lobbyist in Washington D.C. and just yesterday, he made a public announcement that is very timely indeed. Steven runs the Paradigm Research Group , which lobbies for the official political announcement disclosing the truth about the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon that the U.S. government has been covering up for decades. Steven Basset has pushed for disclosure for over 20 years in Washington D.C. 
In a press release from November 17th, 2016, Basset said the Paradigm Research Group was contacted by a source within the military/intelligence community and that the basis of the message was that the â€œpersons who are directly involved in the management of the extraterrestrial issues want Disclosure to take place under President Obama and are ready to work with the Secretary of Defense if approached.â€ 
Basset goes on to explain that the Paradigm Research Group has publicly stated before that the Clinton team has had an agenda to disclose to the world the existence of extraterrestrial beings if she became president. Since she lost the presidential race, that is no longer an option, but instead, may force the issue to happen quicker and while Barack Obama is still president: 
â€œThe Clintons now have a choice to make of historic proportions. Should they immediately take interviews with top journalists and discuss in greater detail what they know about the ET issue and what transpired during the Rockefeller Initiative from 1993-1996 , the resulting media storm will force the Pentagon and the White House to reach the necessary understanding allowing Barack Obama to be the Disclosure president. Or should they remain silent and allow the truth embargo to continue on into the next administration.â€ When will the truth be announced? 
While the amount of information and steps needed for the Secretary of Defense to brief the White House is immense, Steven says the pressure is building quickly for Obama to be the one to make the historic announcement: 
In order for the Secretary of Defense to approach the White House regarding Disclosure, he must reach down into the military/intelligence complex for the needed information to proceed. Although the managers of the ET issues are constrained by the highest level of classification, Paradigm Research Group is convinced they are ready to provide that information because there is a growing internal consensus Disclosure must take place under President Obama. 
This process is time sensitive. Disclosure would need to happen early enough for the nation [and world] to absorb such extraordinary information and settle down prior to the inauguration. There would also be time to prepare various government agencies for the engagement of the media and the public going forward. Then the new president would be stepping into a relatively stable and organized post-Disclosure status. 
With this in mind, Paradigm Research Group would assert Disclosure after January 6th, 2017 would not be a responsible option. The means the Clintons have a choice to make and a few weeks to reach a decision.â€ 
While some may still be skeptics of the notion that there are other beings in our universe, we must keep in mind the number of insiders who have revealed what they know as well as the positions theyâ€™ve held to acquire such knowledge. As we reported earlier today , full UFO disclosure is inevitable. With former NASA astronauts, physicists, scientists, engineers and high ranking military personnel blowing the whistle for several decades now, we see that the world is getting closer to learning the truth. 
With respect to this announcement from Paradigm Research Group just yesterday, we must keep a couple things in mind. First, in the grand scheme of the disclosure process, it is not crucially important if this announcement takes place under Obama before Trumpâ€™s inauguration in late January of 2017. If such an announcement is not made before then, we mustnâ€™t believe the push for disclosure is or has been a failure. We must keep in mind the bigger picture and specifically the words from the press release, â€œthere is a growing internal consensus Disclosure must take placeâ€¦â€ That is what is important. Itâ€™s the fact that there is such momentum and pressure building within the political and military/intelligence community for this announcement to be made public. 
What are your thoughts about this latest announcement? Will Obama be the disclosing president? Or will Trump? Or will some other world leader make the announcement? When do you think it will happen?

21252,President Obamaâ€™s Interview With Samantha Bee Will Have You Rolling On The Floor Laughing (VIDEO),April Hamlin,"  
President Obama is known for his humor, but his interview with Samantha Bee is downright hilarious. 
During his final days in office, Obama has been making rounds on talk shows. When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. 
Bee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. 
She finally asked Obama if he would â€œmessâ€ with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. 
â€œAfter you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald Trumpâ€™s ear, â€˜You were right, I wasnâ€™t born here,â€™ just to, like, mess with him?â€ Bee asked. 
â€œI think itâ€™s fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where Iâ€™m not close enough to him to whisper into his ear,â€ Obama shot back. 
They did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States. But the playful back and forth between President Obama and Bee is too funny to miss. It also reminds us just why it is that we are going to miss this man so much when he is gone.

Former United States Department of State official Dr. Steve Pieczenik is a psychiatrist who has over 20 years experience in resolving international crises for four U.S. administrations.
Pieczenik was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, and James Baker. His expertise includes foreign policy, international crisis management, and psychological warfare. He served the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the capacity of deputy assistant secretary.
He has come forward with a series of videos that expose the Clintons, explains that they co-opted many central facets of our government including the White House, the judiciary, the CIA, and the FBI. and claims that the corrupt couple belongs to a high-level pedophile ring.
Pieczenik explains that it was not the Russians who provided information to WikiLeaks â€“ US intelligence offered the data to Julian Assange. This counter-coup is working against Hillary Clinton and her campaign.

Here, Pieczenik discusses the Clintonsâ€™ connections to Anthony Weiner , Jeffrey Espteinâ€™s Lolita Express, and more.

In this video, Pieczenik reveals the details regarding Democratic Party â€˜Fixer,â€ Jeff Rovin.

Dr. Pieczenik tells us â€œthe second American revolutionâ€ is happening.
I hope heâ€™s correct, because we certainly need it.

21255,Russia Freezes Coordination with U.S. in Syria Following American Airstrikes,Breitbart Jerusalem,"(AP) MOSCOW  â€”   Russia reacted to U. S. military strikes on its ally Syria Friday by cutting a hotline intended to prevent midair incidents, a response that demonstrates Moscowâ€™s readiness to defy Washington and could even put the two nuclear superpowers on a course toward military confrontation. [President Vladimir Putin signaled he was ready to risk a clash with the U. S. and abandon hopes for mending ties with the U. S. under President Donald Trump, rather than accept the humiliation of standing by while his ally is bombed.  Russiaâ€™s decision to suspend the hotline established after the launch of the Russian air campaign in Syria in September 2015 effectively means that Russian and U. S. planes could fly dangerously close to each other during combat missions, raising the risk of inadvertent or deliberate clashes in the crowded skies over Syria. By freezing the information channel between the two potent militaries, Russia is signaling to Washington that it will tolerate no further strikes on Syrian government facilities. Syria has aging   aircraft and air defense missile systems, while Russia has deployed dozens of its cutting edge warplanes and air defense batteries at its base in Syriaâ€™s coastal province of Latakia. It also has a strategically important naval outpost in the Syrian port of Tartus, which is protected by air defense assets. Further upping the ante, the Russian Defense Ministry said it will now help strengthen Syrian air defenses. U. S. officials accused Russia of failing to ensure Syrian President Bashar Assadâ€™s commitment to a 2013 deal for the destruction of Assadâ€™s chemical weapons arsenal. The U. S. says that arsenal was tapped for a chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province. Trump cited the chemical attack as justification for the missile strike on a Syrian air base. But the Kremlin insists Assadâ€™s government wasnâ€™t responsible for the attack, saying civilians in Khan Sheikhoun were exposed to toxic agents from a rebel arsenal that was hit by Syrian warplanes. â€œPresident Putin believes that the U. S. strikes on Syria represent an aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law under a   pretext,â€ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement. â€œWashingtonâ€™s move deals a significant blow to  . S. relations, which are already in deplorable shape. â€ Until the attack on the Syrian air base, the U. S. had avoided striking Assadâ€™s forces for fear of provoking a clash with the Russian military. The action comes ahead of U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillersonâ€™s trip to Moscow next week. The Kremlin initially had been encouraged by Trumpâ€™s goal of repairing ties with Moscow, which plunged to   War lows under President Barack Obama, but hopes for a thaw have withered amid the congressional investigation of possible links between Trump campaign officials and Russia. The U. S. missile strike could make it all but impossible to improve relations. â€œSome people here thought that it would be easy to deal with Trump,â€ Yelena Suponina, a   Mideast expert, said in televised remarks. â€œNo, it will be very difficult. Heâ€™s not only ready to make tough decisions, he is unpredictable. â€ Mikhail Yemelyanov, a senior member of the lower house of parliament, warned that the U. S. action raised the threat of a direct clash between Russia and the U. S. â€œConsequences could be grave, up to military confrontation and exchange of blows, nothing can be excluded,â€ he said, according to the Interfax news agency. Tillerson said Russia had â€œfailed in its responsibilityâ€ to deliver on a 2013 deal it helped broker to destroy Syriaâ€™s chemical arsenal. â€œSo either Russia has been complicit, or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,â€ he said. By ordering the strike, Trump threatened the military assets of Assad, who has enjoyed Russiaâ€™s support throughout the   conflict. Russiaâ€™s military has helped turn the war in Assadâ€™s favor and Moscow has used its U. N. Security Council veto to protect Damascus from censure. Russia also has important military facilities in Syria that could be put at risk if Assad is removed from power, a goal of Western powers that had recently been put on the back burner because of the focus on fighting Islamic State extremists in Syria and Iraq. Peskov said the U. S. gave Russia advance notice about the strike. He added that Moscow believes it makes no sense to maintain the hotline. Asked if the decision to freeze the information exchange could raise the risk of midair incidents, Peskov said it was the U. S. attack that increased such danger. Peskov wouldnâ€™t say if Russia could use its military assets to protect Syrian facilities from future U. S. strikes. Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia will quickly â€œstrengthen the Syrian air defense system and increase its efficiency in order to protect Syriaâ€™s most sensitive infrastructure facilities. â€"
21256,"Romania Set for First Female, and First Muslim, Prime Minister - The New York Times",Kit Gillet,"BUCHAREST, Romania  â€”   In a surprise move, Romaniaâ€™s largest political party nominated a woman from the countryâ€™s Tatar minority for prime minister on Wednesday. If she wins approval from the president and Parliament, she will be both the first Muslim and the first woman to hold the post. The Social Democratic Party scored a resounding victory in the Dec. 11 general election, winning more than 45 percent of the vote. Together with its smaller ally, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, it holds a majority of the seats in Parliament. Ordinarily, the leader of the largest party is designated by the countryâ€™s president to become prime minister. But the Social Democratsâ€™ leader, Liviu Dragnea, would have been a problematic choice: He was convicted of electoral fraud and given a   suspended sentence in April. President Klaus Iohannis has said that the countryâ€™s next prime minister should be untainted by criminal convictions or continuing investigations. So the Social Democrats turned instead to Sevil Shhaideh, 52, a relatively   figure who served as minister of regional development for six months in the last Social   government. â€œItâ€™s a surprising choice,â€ said Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at   University in Cluj. â€œPeople were expecting somebody controlled by Dragnea, but from the partyâ€™s upper levels, not a relative newcomer. â€ â€œPicking Shhaideh suggests that Dragnea will control the government without taking direct responsibility,â€ Professor Miscoiu added. â€œShe is not stained in a direct way, so Iohannis has no official reason to reject her. â€ Professor Miscoiu said the choice might have also been intended to counter accusations of orthodoxism and nationalism during the campaign. Referring to the Social Democratic Party, he said: â€œP. S. D. are saying implicitly with this nomination: â€˜You accused us of being nationalist and orthodoxist  â€”   look what we do, donâ€™t you like it?â€™ â€ The nomination of Ms. Shhaideh took many observers by surprise. â€œWe have seen many names put forward in the last days, but her name was not among them,â€ said Paul Ivan, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels and a former Romanian diplomat. Ms. Shhaideh is thought of as more of a manager than a politician, Mr. Ivan said. â€œShe is seen as a technocrat,â€ he said. â€œSheâ€™s an economist who has worked in local and regional administration for many years. â€ Ms. Shhaideh has spent most of her career in Constanta, a port on the Black Sea, and not in Bucharest, the capital. But she is seen as close to Mr. Dragnea. She was secretary of state in the Development Ministry when Mr. Dragnea was its minister, succeeding him when he stepped down in 2015. He attended her wedding to a Syrian businessman. Ms. Shhaideh and her husband own three properties in Syria, according to a declaration of financial interests from July 2015. Muslim women have very rarely served as heads of state or government in Europe. The few previous examples were in countries with Muslim majorities: Tansu Ciller was prime minister of Turkey in the 1990s, and Atifete Jahjaga was president of Kosovo from 2011 to 2016. By contrast, more than 80 percent of Romanians are Orthodox Christians, while fewer than 1 percent are Muslims. â€œThere will clearly be part of the electorate that wonâ€™t like it,â€ Mr. Ivan said of the partyâ€™s choice of Ms. Shhaideh. â€œThey also wonâ€™t like that the two most powerful political positions in Romania will be taken by those from ethnic and religious minorities. â€ (Mr. Iohannis, the president, is Protestant and of German ancestry.) Even so, Mr. Ivan said he did not think Ms. Shhaidehâ€™s faith would make her seem alien to fellow Romanians. â€œGenerally, Romaniaâ€™s Muslim community, the Turks and Tatars, the Islam they practice is a very moderate one,â€ he said. â€œThey have lived more than 100 years in a   country, theyâ€™ve been through a socialist regime. If you look at Shhaideh, her head isnâ€™t covered. â€ There appeared to be little chance that the appointment of Ms. Shhaideh would soften Romaniaâ€™s position on migrant quotas. Romania was one of the European Union member countries that initially opposed the setting of mandatory quotas for the relocation of migrants, many of whom are from the Middle East or northern Africa. â€œIronically, the fact that she is a Muslim will prevent her from being too bold on areas like refugees, simply because it is so easy to demonize and say, â€˜Of course you say that, youâ€™re a Muslim,â€™ â€ said Radu Magdin, brand ambassador of Smartlink Communications, a political consulting group. â€œHer team will advise her not to get involved in issues where things can become personal. â€ Now that Ms. Shhaideh has been nominated, the next step is for the president to formally designate her as the next prime minister that could happen this week. She would then need to be confirmed in office by a vote of confidence in Parliament."
21257,Police Seize $1 Million of Super Drug from Home,Ryan Saavedra,"Pennsylvania State Police raided the home of Kerri Malloy on Wednesday after postal workers notified them of a delivered package that contained carfentanil, CBS Pittsburgh reported. [Carfentanil, a tranquilizer designed to put down   elephants, is 10, 000 times more potent than morphine and is 100 times more potent than fentanyl. A dose of carfentanil the size of a grain of sand is considered a lethal dose for a human being.  â€œItâ€™s so dangerous that while our people are gathering evidence they have to be in full suits that you would see for the clandestine team,â€ said Public Relations Officer Stephen Limani. State police indicated that the 5 grams of carfentanil seized are enough to make 50, 000 stamp bags of heroin. At $20 per stamp bag, Limani said that 5 grams of carfentanil are enough to create $1 million of the product. â€œI would be shocked if this delivery did not end up killing a large quantity of people in our area,â€ Trooper Limani told reporters. In addition to the carfentanil, police also discovered a grow operation of 136 marijuana plants. Police confirmed that child and youth services are also involved in the case because a child was among those living in the home.

Why Flu Shots Are the Greatest Medical Fraud in History As one of the very few independent voices willing to stand up against the scientific dogma of our mo... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/why-flu-shots-are-greatest-medical.html As one of the very few independent voices willing to stand up against the scientific dogma of our modern medical regime, I've long felt a need to communicate the dangers of flu shots to the public so that people can have better information to prevent vaccine injuries and save lives. This doesn't mean I'm opposed to the theory of vaccination, by the way. In fact, I'm the author of A Blueprint for Safer Vaccines , an audio guide to saving lives and preventing vaccine injuries and deaths. To my knowledge, I'm the only independent journalist in the world who is scientifically trained to run an atomic mass spectrometry laboratory, which I've been running for nearly a year now and testing the heavy metals content of organic superfoods like cacao , common vaccines as well as the ability of water filers to remove toxic heavy metals . I'm the creator of the Low Heavy Metals Verified standard and I'm the inventor of patent-pending nutritional formulas for capturing heavy metals during digestion and binding with the radioactive isotopes of cesium (such as Cesium-137) to eliminate them from the digestive tract.Both of these patents are on file with the U.S. patent office awaiting a decision. My independent atomic elemental analysis of flu vaccines, published in the summer of 2014, proved that flu vaccines contain over 50 ppm mercury, an extremely toxic heavy metal linked to kidney failure, birth defects, spontaneous abortions and neurological damage. This finding has never been refuted by anyone. In fact, it was affirmed by vaccine proponents who insisted that it is perfectly safe to inject pregnant women, young children and senior citizens with mercury even though the flu vaccine insert itself readily admits there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in such groups. Believe it or not, there are still millions of people, doctors, pharmacists and even journalists who do not yet realize there is a very high concentration of mercury in influenza vaccines given to pregnant women, children and senior citizens. Most people, you see, have been lied to by the media which has stated over and over again that mercury was removed from all vaccines. That's simply not true. It's still there. And toxic mercury is present in influenza vaccines at a level that's literally 25,000 times higher than the EPA limit of mercury in drinking water. [7] It's 100 times higher than the highest level of mercury contamination I've ever tested in ocean fish. See the evidence for yourself To prove the presence of mercury in influenza vaccines, I'm going to show you four irrefutable pieces of evidence: 1) Photographs of a 2013 / 2014 influenza vaccine box admitting, in very small print, to the addition of mercury to the vaccine as a preservative. 2) Photographs of the influenza vaccine insert once again repeating the admission that the vaccine contains mercury. 3) A screen shot from the Centers for Disease Control website which admits that vaccines still contain the following ingredients: Aluminum, Antibiotics, Egg Protein, Formaldehyde, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) and Thimerosal, a mercury-containing chemical compound. 4) Lab results from the Natural News Forensic Food Lab which confirmed almost precisely the same level of mercury claimed by the manufacturer (GlaxoSmithKline). Before I show you the irrefutable evidence, there is some good news in all this testing. As part of this Natural News investigation, I tested several different vaccines, including an HPV vaccine. Mercury levels were extremely low in these other vaccines. Only the flu shot contained extremely high mercury levels. Influenza vaccine box admits safety never established for pregnant women As you can see below, the box for this Flulaval Influenza Virus Vaccine readily admits the use of thimerosal which contains mercury. (Of course, you have to use a magnifying glass to see this.) In microscopic text on the package insert, it says straight out, ""Register women who receive Flulaval while pregnant in the pregnancy registry by calling 1-888-452-9622."" Yet, at the same time, the insert also admits that ""safety and efficacy have not been established in pregnant women."" In other words, this vaccine containing mercury is being promoted for use in pregnant women even when no safety in pregnant women has ever been established. It's also important to note that when people are being given flu shots, they are never handed the package or the insert, so they have no opportunity to read any of this information unless they specifically ask for it. It's not like a food item with a ""Nutrition Facts"" label. Vaccines are sold in ""stealth"" mode where patients have no idea what's in them and no opportunity to read possible warnings. As further proof of this point, consider the fact that this flu vaccine comes with only one insert, yet it's a 10-dose vial intended to be injected into 10 different people. Clearly, if there's only one insert but 10 people, then 9 out of 10 people can't possibly be handed the insert. Unethical medicine administered without informed consent (a violation of medical ethics) In fact, from a legal perspective, vaccines are routinely injected into people without informed consent. Virtually no one administering vaccines ever explains the risks vs. benefits of vaccines as is required under medical ethics and state medical law. In nearly all cases, patients are simply hoodwinked and told there are no risks at all. The second piece of evidence to reveal here is the package insert for the influenza vaccine, a document printed in microscopic text that's almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. Of course, the intention is that no one ever read this document, because it contains shocking admissions of the total quackery and marketing deception behind flu shots. As you can see from this snapshot, the package insert readily admits that each vaccine dose ""contains 50 mcg thimerosal (<25 mcg="""" mercury="""" p=""""><25 br="""" mcg="""" mercury="""">In case you're wondering, ""mcg"" means micrograms. A microgram is 1/1000th of a milligram. Mercury is toxic at any dose when injected into the body, even in micrograms. There is no such thing as a ""safe"" form of mercury when injected. In fact, the ethyl form of mercury used in vaccines is many times more toxic than methyl form once it enters human cells. Click here for a fascinating interview with mercury toxicity expert Dr. Chris Shade who explains this extremely important concept.The same paragraph shown above also admits the vaccine contains formaldehyde, a potent neurotoxic chemical. Vaccine insert admits safety and effectiveness have never been established <25 br="""" mcg="""" mercury="""">What's even more astonishing about this insert is that it openly admits the flu shot is a complete medical hoax, backed by nothing but voodoo woo woo faith-based dogma (and clever marketing).Here are actual words from the insert (which is much more lengthy than the snapshot shown above):""There have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Flulaval.""""Safety and effectiveness of Flulaval have not been established in pregnant women, nursing mothers or children.""""Safety and effectiveness of Flulaval in pediatric patients have not been established.""""Flulaval has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.""""Do not administer Flulaval to anyone... following previous administration of any influenza vaccine.""CDC admits use of mercury, MSG, formaldehydeFor those ""mercury denialists"" who still can't believe flu shots given to pregnant women contain high concentrations of toxic mercury, even the CDC reluctantly admits this fact on its own website.Here's a screen shot from the CDC's vaccine additives page , which miraculously hasn't yet been removed from their site:<25 br="""" mcg="""" mercury=""""> Laboratory results from the Natural News Forensic Food Lab The final piece of irrefutable evidence on all this comes from my own scientific laboratory , where I run ICP-MS instrumentation to test foods, beverages, dietary supplements and other items for heavy metals contamination.I was the first food researcher to document high levels of tungsten in brown rice protein , and I've exposed alarming levels of lead in pet treats . I've also exposed high lead in ginkgo biloba herbal supplements imported from China .When I finally got around to testing vaccines, I was shocked to find over 51,000 ppb mercury in the Influenza Virus Vaccine.Why was I shocked? Because I don't recall ever seeing anything run through my ICP-MS instrument with that high a concentration of mercury. The mercury in this flu vaccine was the HIGHEST concentration of mercury I've ever seen in anything, period! And this is a product that's injected directly into the bodies of pregnant women, where mercury goes right into the developing fetus.What's even more interesting is that this finding once again confirms the accuracy of my lab instrumentation because it's almost in perfect agreement with the level of mercury detailed on the vaccine package insert.Let's do the math:* Each dose of an influenza vaccine is 0.5 mL in volume* My lab found just over 50 ppm of mercury in the vaccine liquid.* 50 ppm (concentration) x 0.5 mL (volume) equals 25 mcg of mercury.Guess what the package insert says? (Up to) 25 mcg of mercury per dose. Near-perfect agreement, in other words. My finding of 51 ppm rather than 50 ppm either means my own tests were off by about 2% (which is still considered very accurate for ICP-MS testing) or that GSK put 2% extra mercury into the vaccine.And just so you know I actually did the tests, here's what else we found with other analytes:Aluminum: 0.4 ppmCadmium: zeroLead: zeroSo, I can confidently say that the flu vaccine won't poison you with lead, cadmium or arsenic because it contains none of those things. Even the aluminum level is quite low and not a concern at this very low level. The real problem is just the mercury, at least as far as elements go. Why won't vaccine makers remove the mercury? Good question. Everybody knows mercury is toxic to inject into the human body. That's not debated except by irrational anti-science denialists who refuse to acknowledge the Table of Elements.You have to wonder: why choose mercury as a preservative? And why do both the CDC and FDA continue to look the other way as an entire branch of modern medicine poisons our women and children with a neurotoxic heavy metal?And if vaccine promoters, propagandists and patent holders want the world to accept all their vaccines, why don't they just remove the mercury and be done with it? If they take out all the toxic elements, resistance to vaccines would all but evaporate.Why vaccines are the ""anti-science"" medical voodoo of the modern worldEver wonder why they don't conduct legitimate clinical trials on flu vaccine efficacy? Probably because they know the results would have to be faked to show any efficacy at all. That's what Merck did with its mumps vaccines, according to two former virologists who worked there. They spiked human blood samples with animal antibodies to fabricate positive results. Yep, vaccines work so poorly that even the manufacturers have to fake their own results to show any efficacy.Vaccines are the one medicine where no scientific evidence of safety or efficacy is required by anyone: not the FDA, not the CDC and not the media. Congress even passed a law protecting the vaccine industry with absolute legal immunity, even when they manufacture and sell defective products that injure and kill people . How's that for medicine we can all trust? Think about it: this is a product that contains multiple neurotoxins in very high concentrations; a product backed by no safety trials or efficacy data; a product linked to numerous serious adverse reactions; and yet a product that enjoys absolute legal immunity thanks to the U.S. government.If that's not outright medical quackery, I don't know what is.For the record, I'm not an opponent of all vaccines. But I do believe -- as do a rapidly increasing number of other clear-thinking people -- that medicine should not poison our women and children . It's time for mercury to be removed from all vaccines, once and for all. Anything less is medical negligence. New video interview about flu shot failures Ultimately, We the People will be victorious in the removal of mercury from all vaccines -- an idea that's already well accepted across much of Europe. And when that day comes, it will be yet another victory for the Natural News fan base, an amazing community of millions of remarkable people working together for the protection of our children, our health and our world.See my recent video interview with Next News Network's Gary Franchi on why flu shots are failures: By Mike Adams , author of Food Forensics   Related"
21259,More Measles in Minnesota: 69 Cases Now Confirmed - Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,"The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) reported on Monday that the number of confirmed measles cases in the outbreak that began in April has increased to 69. [For the first time, MDH is confirming that the outbreak has spread beyond the Somali community in Minnesota to white and Hispanic residents of the state.   of the 69 cases of measles are in Somali Minnesotans, seven are    and three are   MDH reported.  Though the number of cases continues to grow, the cases have not spread beyond four counties: Three cases are in adults, 66 are in children (ages   years).   of the 69 cases have been â€œconfirmed to be unvaccinated. â€ Of the remaining four cases, â€œ1 had 1 dose of MMR [and] 3 had 2 doses of MMR. â€ Since 1997, the number of measles cases diagnosed in Minnesota has exceeded double digits only once, in 2011, when 26 cases were diagnosed. The current measles outbreak is the largest in the state since 1990, when a total of 460 cases of measles were confirmed. Experts say the outbreak is likely to continue to spread. MDH officials have said the initial infection that sparked the current measles outbreak was due to a foreign traveler. â€œMeasles is a rare disease in Minnesota and in the U. S. however, measles is still common in other parts of the world. Most measles cases occurring in Minnesota result from someone traveling to or from countries where measles is common, and who are infectious with measles after arriving in Minnesota,â€ the MDH website states. As part of its public information program to promote vaccinations, MDH offers a Think Measles  â€œ[l]etter size poster with a reminder to get vaccinated for measles before international travel,â€ that is available in nine languages, including English, Amharic, Hmong, Khmer, Oromo, Somali, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. The outbreak began in the Somali community, which has seen vaccination rates plummet over the past decade. MDH officials blame that drop in vaccination rates on   who have spread the medically discredited claim that vaccinations are tied to autism to the Somali community in Minnesota.  . Paul is home to the largest Somali community in the United States, estimated to be about 70, 000 in total. â€œSince FY 2002, 100, 246 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States, according to the State Departmentâ€™s interactive website,â€ Breitbart News reported in December. In Olmsted County, which is about 70 miles southeast of Le Sueur County, â€œa public forum has been scheduled for Monday evening in Rochester to discuss Minnesotaâ€™s worst measles outbreak since 1990,â€ the Post Bulletin reported: The Somali Health Advisory Committee has organized the forum in hopes of addressing the Somali communityâ€™s increasing resistance to the MMR vaccine because of fears of its links to autism, a claim that has been debunked repeatedly by the science community. Abdirashid Shire, director of Rochesterâ€™s Health and Research Institute for Somali Americans, and Nasra Giama, a nursing professor at the University of Minnesota Rochester and a Mayo Clinic researcher, will lead the discussion. Representatives from Mayo Clinic, Olmsted Medical Center, Olmsted County Public Health and Minnesota Department of Health are expected to attend and participate in the discussion. â€œThe primary goal is to talk about childhood health issues, specifically about trying to dispel the myth about the link between MMR and autism and the importance of vaccines,â€ Dawn Beck, associate director of the Olmsted County Public Health, told the Post Bulletin: Despite ongoing efforts from MDH and other health agencies in recent years, Minnesotaâ€™s Somali community has seen its vaccination rate plunge from nearly 90 percent to the  . In Olmsted County, Somalis have an MMR vaccination rate of 75 percent, according to 2016 data. Despite good news locally, Olmsted Countyâ€™s recent Community Health Needs Assessment identified immunizations as one of its top five priorities in 2017. Minnesota state officials now believe the current measles outbreak, combined with increased rates of tuberculosis and syphilis, has become a significant public health problem in the state. Minnesota Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger said earlier this month: In recent months, state and local public health officials have had to respond to a series of infectious disease outbreaks including   resistant tuberculosis, hundreds of new cases of syphilis, and now, the largest measles outbreak the state has faced in nearly 30 years. These outbreaks come on the heels of extensive public health efforts in 2016 for the Zika virus response and in   for Ebola preparedness. With state and local response costs for the first half of 2017 approaching $3 million just for measles, tuberculosis and syphilis, I respectfully request that the legislature create a public health response contingency fund of $5 million to ensure sufficient resources are available for immediate,   actions to protect Minnesotans from infectious disease outbreaks and other unanticipated public health threats. â€œGovernor Dayton has given me his support for this proposal and we will advocate for its inclusion in any final legislative budget agreement,â€ Ehlinger noted."
21260,Breitbart Exposed White House Visitor Logs as a Transparency Con - Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,"Critics are blasting President Donald Trump for ending an   policy of releasing White House visitor logs on Friday. [The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for example, called the move â€œthe latest in a series of efforts by President Trump to avoid public accountability. â€  In reality, the White House visitor logs rarely informed the public of anything. They were a fig leaf that let the Obama administration claim transparency while hiding its real operations. (Update: Moreover, the Obama administration went to court to resist releasing the visitor logs, at least initially.) Andrew Breitbart was the first to catch onto President Barack Obamaâ€™s con game. In March 2011, he posted an essay  â€”   at the Huffington Post, no less  â€”   titled: â€œThe White House Guess List: How Obama Pulled a Fast One on the American People  â€”   in the Name of â€˜Transparency. â€™â€ Breitbart pointed out that â€œthe visitor logs may hide more than they revealâ€: The White House is still holding back â€œtens of thousandsâ€ of visitor logs, according to congressional testimony last week by Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, who also added that â€œthe Obama administration is less transparent than the Bush administration. â€ We also know that some of the most important presidential visitors donâ€™t even walk into the White House. The administration meets K Street lobbyists at Caribou Coffee, and holds secret meetings in Jackson Place townhouses  where there are no visitor logs. The visitor logs that have been released are problematic, because they are simply lists of names, with no way to verify whether a specific name belongs to a particular person.   â€¦     With no way to verify, there is no real transparency. The visitor logs were a key part of President Barack Obamaâ€™s claim to have run â€œthe most transparent administration in history. â€ But in every other way, he was one of the least transparent presidents in the   era. Obama â€œset a recordâ€ for failing to comply with Freedom of Access to Information Act requests, among other   sins. Obamaâ€™s visitor logs were no deterrent to the crooked and malevolent. Logs revealed that   activist Robert Creamer, a convicted felon and the man behind an effort to instigate violence at Trump campaign events, visited the White House some 340 times, with 45 visits including the president himself. The media never cared, nor did he. Arguably, two wrongs donâ€™t make a right. The fact that the Trump administration took advantage of the Good Friday holiday to announce the policy change might suggest some degree of moral doubt. Yet the fact is that visitor logs were never a useful tool to enforcing executive transparency. Better tools are needed, and it is foolish to pretend otherwise. Joel B.

21261,German Local Authorities Halt Pro-Erdogan Islamist Rallies,Breitbart London,"BERLIN (AFP)  â€”   German local authorities on Thursday blocked rallies by Turkish ministers aimed at promoting a referendum that would expand President Recep Tayyip Erdoganâ€™s powers, citing capacity problems. [The Union of European Turkish Democrats had been due to hold one rally later Thursday in the western town of Gaggenau, with Turkeyâ€™s Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag as the guest speaker.  But Gaggenau authorities withdrew an earlier agreement for the group to rent a hall for the event, saying it did not have the capacity to host so many people. â€œBecause the event is now known across the region, the city expects a large number of visitors. However, the Bad Rotenfels hall, parking lots and access road are insufficient to meet that demand,â€ the townâ€™s authorities said in a statement. â€œDue to these reasons, the hall rental agreement with the UETD has been revoked,â€ it added. Separately, Cologne city authorities said they would no longer allow the UETD to use a hall on Sunday, when Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci is expected to make a rally speech. â€œThe event can and will not happen there,â€ a spokeswoman for Cologne city authorities told AFP. It was unclear if Zeybekci would be able to find an alternative site. The UETD had earlier reserved a room in the city hall of the   district for a â€œtheatre eventâ€ said the spokeswoman. But on Wednesday, the group said it would now host an â€œinformation eventâ€. The city said however that it would no longer make the site available to the group, citing difficulties in guaranteeing security at such short notice. Turkish politicians including Prime Minister Binali Yildirim have sparked controversy over their visits to Germany to hold political rallies. Germany is home to about three million people of Turkish origin, the legacy of a massive â€œguest workerâ€ programme in the 1960s and 70s and the biggest population of Turks in the world outside of Turkey. And Erdoganâ€™s government is keen to harness their votes for the April 16 referendum, which would discard the post of prime minister for the first time in Turkeyâ€™s history. Critics say the new presidential system will cement   rule in the country.   relations have been strained by a series of disputes since the failed coup that aimed to oust Erdogan last July. The latest issue dogging ties is Ankaraâ€™s provisional detention of a German journalist on   charges. Deniz Yucel, 43, a correspondent of the German newspaper Die Welt, has been held since February 18 in connection with news reports on an attack by hackers against the email account of Turkeyâ€™s energy minister. Berlinâ€™s sharp criticism of Ankaraâ€™s massive crackdown after the failed putsch has also irked Turkey."
21262,Day Without Illegals Becomes a Political Dud - Breitbart,Neil Munro,"The   â€œDay Without Immigrantsâ€ turned out to be a day without many protestors or any political impact, but with many Mexican flags, angry slogans, and a muted   response by amnesty advocates.

21263,Is D.N.C. Email Hacker a Person or a Russian Front? Experts Arenâ€™t Sure - The New York Times,Charlie Savage and Nicole Perlroth,"WASHINGTON  â€”   Who is Guccifer 2. 0, the   Romanian â€œlone hackerâ€ responsible for copying thousands of emails and other files from the Democratic National Committee  â€”   a real person, or a front created by Russian intelligence officials? Technology specialists have been debating that question since June 15, when CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee, announced that sophisticated hacker groups with Russian links were responsible for breaching the committeeâ€™s computer servers. Within hours of the announcement, someone using the moniker Guccifer 2. 0 started a blog to mock that finding, posting several of the stolen documents and claiming sole credit. But the publication by WikiLeaks of an archive of the committeeâ€™s internal emails  â€”   and the uproar they caused on the eve of the Democratic National Convention  â€”   have focused wider attention on who, or what, is operating behind that name. While WikiLeaks has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2. 0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to WikiLeaks. Cybersecurity specialists have pointed to an array of forensic and technical evidence suggesting that Guccifer 2. 0 might not be a Romanian as claimed. That evidence included metadata hidden in the early documents indicating that they were edited on a computer with Russian language settings. American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2. 0 is a front for the G. R. U. Russiaâ€™s military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation. In blog posts, Twitter messages, and electronic chats with journalists, Guccifer 2. 0 has insisted such skeptics are wrong. Against that backdrop, Guccifer 2. 0â€™s words are taking on heightened interest. They may be clues to a personâ€™s decision to intervene in the American election, or they may be a case study of a   Russian information campaign  â€”   the work of different intelligence officials, crowded around a keyboard. â€œJust because the Wizard of Oz says heâ€™s a wizard doesnâ€™t actually mean he is,â€ said Peter Singer, a security strategist at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute. The original â€œGucciferâ€ (pronounced  ) is a real person: Marcel Lazar Lehel, a Romanian hacker who used the pseudonym Guccifer to hack various accounts belonging to American celebrities and government officials, including members of the Bush family, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, and Sidney Blumenthal, an informal adviser to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Lehel was arrested in Romania in 2014 for hacking the email accounts of several Romanian officials. In April, he was extradited to the United States to face hacking charges and pleaded guilty in May before a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. While awaiting sentencing, Mr. Lehel claimed to have hacked Mrs. Clintonâ€™s private email server, but federal officials have found no evidence to support his claim. Mr. Lehel is known for his fixation on what conspiracy theorists call the Illuminati, a shadowy group that they believe controls the world. The first Guccifer 2. 0 blog post, and messages Guccifer 2. 0 sent along with packages of files that same day to the websites Gawker and The Smoking Gun, also denounced the Illuminati. Other oddities also arose. Technical specialists, scouring metadata on documents posted to Guccifer 2. 0â€™s blog, found some that were last marked by a person with a user name in Cyrillic that appeared to be a nod to Felix E. Dzerzhinsky, best known for establishing the early Soviet secret police forces. On June 21, Motherboard, an online technology magazine, posted a Twitter chat log of an interview with Guccifer 2. 0, in which the person using that account claimed to be Romanian and denied working with the Russian government. Pressed on why Russian language markings showed up in the metadata of the documents he had sent out, Guccifer 2. 0 claimed that was just a â€œwatermark. â€ â€œI donâ€™t like Russians and their foreign policy. I hate being attributed to Russia,â€ Guccifer 2. 0 wrote. During the interview, Motherboard switched from using English to Romanian and to Russian. Guccifer 2. 0 claimed not to speak Russian and abruptly cut off the interview. Motherboard later reported findings of linguistics specialists who said that his Romanian answers did not seem like those of a native speaker, and that the syntax of several of his English lines echoed Russian sentence constructions. And a linguistic analysis provided to The New York Times by Shlomo Argamon, a chief scientist at Taia Global, a cybersecurity firm that has questioned cyberattack attribution claims in the past, also concluded that Guccifer 2 is Russian. Mr. Argamon, who is a professor of computer science and the director of the master of data science program at the Illinois Institute of Technology, found seven oddities in the hackerâ€™s English text, five of which pointed clearly to Russian as the speakerâ€™s native tongue. â€œThe linguistic evidence consistently points towards the writer being either a native Russian speaker,â€ Mr. Argamon said. â€œIt is possible that the writer is a Romanian speaker who has studied Russian. However, the writer denied knowing any Russian, and so the most reasonable conclusion is that he is a Russian native speaker rather than a Romanian native speaker. â€ On June 30, Guccifer 2. 0 posted additional documents from the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s servers on the WordPress blog. The post again denied Russian links, and spoke admiringly of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence analyst who leaked archives of surveillance documents and Chelsea Manning, the Army private who sent a huge trove of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. That post accused Mrs. Clinton of being â€œbought and sold,â€ in contrast to Mr. Trump, who it said â€œhas earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. â€ But the post still expressed opposition to Mr. Trumpâ€™s ideas â€œabout closing borders and deportation policy. â€ Of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the post said, â€œHe never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!â€ The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, reported on July 13 that Guccifer 2. 0 had reached out to it and had provided documents about Democratic campaign donors and lobbyists. It quoted Guccifer 2. 0 as saying in an electronic chat, â€œThe press [is] gradually forget[ing] about me, [W]ikileaks is playing for time and [I] have some more docs. â€ The next day, Guccifer 2. 0 posted those documents on the blog. That was the last blog posting. The Guccifer 2. 0 Twitter account posted a few more messages. The most recent one, on July 22, expressed excitement that WikiLeaks had posted the archive of nearly 20, 000 Democratic committee emails that â€œIâ€™d given them! !!â€ Since then, that account has fallen silent, too. No messages were posted even as the Democratic Party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned and Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign manager accused the Russian government of providing the leaked emails to WikiLeaks to help Mr. Trump."

21265,Colbert Again in Character â€” as Himself â€” at the Conventions - The New York Times,James Poniewozik,"This year, the political conventions pulled off an amazing feat: They rebooted a familiar figure, someone who spent years in the public eye going through   shifts, and who emerged from the quadrennial partisan ritual reintroduced and reinvigorated. Iâ€™m referring, of course, to Stephen Colbert. When â€œThe Late Show With Stephen Colbertâ€ began on CBS in September 2015, it came with enormous expectations and risks. Mr. Colbert was following in David Lettermanâ€™s footsteps as well as his own, having created a satirical performance piece for the ages on Comedy Centralâ€™s â€œThe Colbert Report. â€ His move to a   late night show might have been a reinvention of the form it might have been a bust. Instead, for most of the year, it just   â€¦     was. There was the occasional newsworthy interview, like his emotional September talk with Vice President Joe Biden, grieving the recent loss of his son. There were a few experiments, like letting the director Spike Jonze shoot a   video in which Mr. Colbert shared an existential moment with Grover from â€œSesame Street. â€ Night by night, â€œLate Showâ€ was fine but inessential. Even as a flabbergasting election unfolded, you were less likely to think, â€œWhat is Stephen Colbert going to say about this?â€ than â€œI wonder what Stephen Colbert would have said about this. â€ Then, for the two weeks of the conventions, â€œLate Showâ€ aired live, and it came back to life. Mr. Colbert brought his old buffoonish conservative commentator character back, bearing a Captain America shield, with guest appearances by his old compadre Jon Stewart. He brought out Laura Benanti to spoof Melania Trumpâ€™s plagiarism scandal. He ambushed the stages of both conventions in character as the â€œHunger Gamesâ€ host Caesar Flickerman. The combination of live TV and   politics was like a comedy speedball that â€œLate Showâ€ injected straight into its heart. Where had CBS been keeping this guy? And how can we keep him on the air? Obviously, only so much of this   special is reproducible  . Mr. Colbert isnâ€™t likely to start doing a live show every night, nor to band together with Mr. Stewart to   the old Comedy Central   lineup on CBS. But the convention weeks showed off strengths that â€œLate Showâ€ can and should keep playing to. The most important: Donâ€™t waste Mr. Colbertâ€™s time and ours on topics and guests heâ€™s not engaged in. When heâ€™s had to host stars plugging movies or read off questions to the 2016 Super Bowlâ€™s most valuable player, Von Miller (in his live special after the big game) it felt like the job was defining Mr. Colbert instead of him defining the job. For the last two weeks, Mr. Colbert was focused almost entirely on the most important thing going on in the country and the culture, and his interest and energy showed. That doesnâ€™t necessarily mean doing nothing but politics. Mr. Colbert is not that boring. His interview with Mr. Biden had political overtones  â€”   the vice president was still considering a presidential run. But what made it great was how Mr. Colbert drew on his humanity and Catholic faith to dive deep to the stuff that mattered. He can pull off celebrity interviews, too, when thereâ€™s a real shared interest, as when he and   Key recently geeked out on their love of improv. Speaking of which: Mr. Colbertâ€™s revival of his Comedy Central character and his zany turn as Flickerman reminded us that heâ€™s TVâ€™s best performance artist not currently running for president. â€œLate Showâ€ might want to let him try on more characters. It could also cultivate a stable of other performers  â€”   Mr. Colbert also worked well as ringmaster and hype man for Mr. Stewart and Ms. Benanti. But letting Mr. Colbert be Mr. Colbert will definitely mean politics, and these days, thatâ€™s inevitably going to mean alienating viewers. After the Orlando, Fla. terrorist shooting in June, Mr. Colbert took apart Donald J. Trumpâ€™s response by diagraming a word cloud of the candidateâ€™s insinuations  â€”   â€œObama,â€ â€œsomething going on,â€ â€œradical Islamâ€  â€”   and the connecting lines formed a swastika. It was savage and hilarious and guaranteed to turn off a sizable chunk of the electorate. Mr. Colbert has tried to spread his fire around. When the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, decried big money in politics at the Democratic convention, he snarked that her outcry â€œresounded throughout every corner of the Wells Fargo Arena, from the CNN Grill to the Comcast Xfinity Live complex!â€ But clearly nothing fires his satirical synapses right now like Mr. Trump. Thatâ€™s the guy CBS hired, though. He couldnâ€™t be a Johnny Carson or Jay Leno, amiably poking at the nonpartisan foibles of both sides for a   audience, even if that were still possible today. And it isnâ€™t. That sort of comedy was a product of a less polarized political era, one with less niche programming and more swing voters, with liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, with some consensus on the basic functions of government.     comedy doesnâ€™t work when the road no longer has a middle wide enough to ride a bicycle down. Thatâ€™s why, where past â€œTonightâ€ hosts made light fun of politics, today Jimmy Fallon is most effective when he avoids politics altogether. Heâ€™s good at it, and the ratings are great. Itâ€™s a familiar coping mechanism for people burned out by apocalyptic news and vitriolic social media feeds: Please, letâ€™s just not talk about it for an hour. But the cerebral Mr. Colbert is not a    kind of guy that is his bug and his feature. I donâ€™t pretend to know whether his showâ€™s   drift was driven by CBS, Mr. Colbertâ€™s artistic desire to grow and move on, or both. His convention shows suggested, though, a way to change without renouncing his past works  â€”   just as Mr. Letterman eventually found a distinctive voice on his â€œLate Showâ€ while hanging on to signature features like the   list. On Wednesday night of the second week, Mr. Colbert announced some bad news: Because of an   complaint, he could never use the original â€œStephen Colbertâ€ character, or his commentary segment â€œThe WÃ¸rd,â€ again. Instead, he was bringing on â€œStephen Colbert,â€ the original characterâ€™s â€œidentical twin cousin,â€ and introducing a new commentary feature, â€œThe Werd. â€ â€œI cannot reasonably argue,â€ Mr. Colbert deadpanned, â€œthat I own my face or my name. â€ But in so doing, he very much did own it: He is who he is. And thereâ€™s no reason for his show to fight it."
21266,Fake News from CNN: Legal Expert Says Schumerâ€™s Attacks on Trumpâ€™s Pick to Head HHS â€™Are Entirely About Politicsâ€™,Michael Patrick Leahy,"The Presidential Transition Team called a CNN story about Dr. Tom Price ( ) â€œjunk reportingâ€ and late Tuesday requested â€œthat CNN retract this blatantly false story,â€ noting that the network failed to accurately report all the facts. [Though the term â€œfake news,â€ which   Trump used in a news conference last week to describe CNNâ€™s reporting, was not specifically used, it is clear the Presidential Transition Team considers this latest story from CNN yet another report from that network to which those words also apply.  Price, who will appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Wednesday for his confirmation hearing to become the secretary of Health and Human Services, is one of eight Trump cabinet nominees Schumer has vowed to stop. A legal expert familiar with the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 tells Breitbart News that allegations made by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) on Tuesday and first reported by CNN that â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s pick to quarterback the replacement of Obamacare, Tom Price, might have broken the law with a questionable stock purchaseâ€ are baseless and â€œentirely about politics. â€ Late Monday, CNN reported that â€œRep. Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns for   Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. â€ â€œThe Office of Congressional Ethics needs to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into these potential violations of the STOCK Act before Rep. Priceâ€™s nomination moves forward,â€ Sen. Schumer said in a statement first reported in the CNN story. â€œThe transaction being harped about is so small it barely clears the lawâ€™s reporting requirements,â€ Brady Toensing, former Senate legislative aide and current white collar criminal defense attorney, experienced in defending federal lawmakers and executive branch employees, tells Breitbart News. â€œMost importantly, the stock purchase was done through a broker without the Congressmanâ€™s knowledge, which is the end of the story for allegations like these.  I suspect his accusers are well aware of this, which means these allegations are entirely about politics,â€ Toensing adds. â€œDr. Priceâ€™s Morgan Stanley financial advisor designed his portfolio and directed all trades in the account. Pursuant to the arrangement with Morgan Stanley, the financial advisor, and not Dr. Price, has the discretion to decide which securities to buy and sell in his account,â€ the Presidential Transition Team said in a statement. The statement continues: Dr. Priceâ€™s financial advisor periodically rebalances his portfolio to ensure proper diversification. On March 17, 2016, Morgan Stanley undertook a comprehensive rebalancing of Dr. Priceâ€™s portfolio. In the course of that rebalancing, the advisor purchased 26 shares of Zimmer Biomet, worth $2, 697. 74, on behalf of Dr. Price. The STOCK Act of 2012 applied insider trading laws, which have governed the conduct of executives in publicly traded companies for decades, to members of Congress and employees of the executive branch of the federal government. Those laws require that prosecutors must establish that two elements must be proven to obtain a conviction for violation of insider trading rules: (1) The person who orders the trade in the stock has a fiduciary duty,  to shareholders in the case of the an executive in a publicly traded company, or to the United States and citizens of the United States in the case of a member of Congress or an employee of the executive branch of the federal government  and, (2) The person must make a trade in the stock on the basis of material,   information. â€œIf Tom Price didnâ€™t direct or even know about the trades, how could he be trading on the basis of material   information?â€ a second attorney, an expert in securities law, who is a partner in a major international law firm, tells Breitbart News. â€œHe reported all these trades. None of them were hidden. His broker rebalanced his portfolio,â€ the attorney notes. The attorney says: Some of the stock purchases were in health care, some were energy, some were financial institutions. If you look at the disclosure there were 34 trades on March 17, and while they included some health care companies they also included: Bank of America, American Express, Lowes Corporation, United Technologies, Xerox Corp, Williams Co, Nike, and Ross Stores. Republicans were quick to point out the highly political nature of Schumerâ€™s attack on Price, as well as CNNâ€™s role in spreading the narrative. â€œI hate to interrupt *the narrative* but it seems awfully relevant that these trades were made   Priceâ€™s knowledge,â€ Brendan Buck, an aide to Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) tweeted on Tuesday. At least one other media publication noted the partisan nature of the Democratsâ€™ attack on Price. â€œNo lawmaker has faced insider trading charges since the law was approved, but it has given ammunition to Democrats eager to question Priceâ€™s trading activity,â€ the Hill reported late Tuesday: Democrats have gone so far as to call for Priceâ€™s confirmation hearing to be delayed until ethics investigators have had a chance to review the activity. Sens. Al Franken ( .) Elizabeth Warren ( .) and Tammy Baldwin ( .) said Tuesday that Priceâ€™s confirmation should not go forward until an ethics probe has determined no wrongdoing was committed. â€œAllowing Congressman Priceâ€™s nomination to move to a hearing with questions about his ethical qualifications left unanswered would send an early, clear, and deeply troubling signal that the Senateâ€™s critical oversight functions will be given a back seat to the demands of the Trump Administration,â€ the lawmakers wrote in a letter Wednesday to Sen. Lamar Alexander ( .) who chairs the committee vetting Price. Presidential Transition Team spokesperson Phil Blando said in a statement on Tuesday: Any effort to connect the introduction of bipartisan legislation by Dr. Price to any campaign contribution is demonstrably false. The only pattern we see emerging is that Senate Democrats and their liberal media allies cannot abide the notion that Dr. Tom Price is uniquely qualified to lead HHS and will stop at nothing to smear his reputation. But late Tuesday, Schumer repeated and expanded upon his original allegation to CNNâ€™s Manu Raju. â€œIf he knew about it, it could very well be a violation of the law,â€ Schumer said. â€œNow they say thereâ€™s a broker, itâ€™s kind of strange that this broker would pick this stock totally independently of him introducing legislation thatâ€™s so narrow and specific to this company,â€ Schumer added. In a highly unusual move, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest joined the partisan narrative about Trumpâ€™s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services. â€œThis doesnâ€™t seem like a complicated scheme this seems like exactly the kind of financial entanglement thatâ€™s left a lot of people feeling alienated from Washington, D. C.,â€ Earnest said on Tuesday. The Presidential Transition Team noted that â€œ[a] key point is that if Price divested today, the total profit on this stock investment would be less than $300â€: Dr. Priceâ€™s financial advisor periodically rebalances his portfolio to ensure proper diversification. On March 17, 2016, Morgan Stanley undertook a comprehensive rebalancing of Dr. Priceâ€™s portfolio. In the course of that rebalancing, the advisor purchased 26 shares of Zimmer Biomet, worth $2, 697. 74, on behalf of Dr. Price. 26 shares divided by $2, 697. 74 is $103. 76 per share.

21267,California Today: School Bond Measure? Why You Should Care - The New York Times,Mike McPhate,"Good morning. Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Tell us about the issues that matter to you  â€”   and what youâ€™d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com. Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. As we take a closer look at the 17 voter initiatives on the ballot this November, one of the less prominent measures with a lot of money at stake is Proposition 51. Though it will likely get overshadowed by flashier topics like marijuana and the death penalty, a yes vote would allow the state to issue $9 billion in bonds for school construction projects. Backers have raised more than $9 million to fight for its passage, according to The Sacramento Beeâ€™s Data Tracker. Most of the proceeds from Proposition 51 would go toward upgrading the stateâ€™s   buildings, with another $2 billion set aside for community colleges. Those bankrolling the effort are mostly   construction groups that have a profit motive to see it pass. Supporters say the measure comes at a time of dire need. Itâ€™s been 10 years since the last statewide school bond measure and many of Californiaâ€™s roughly 10, 000 public schools are outdated and crumbling. A couple weeks ago, for example, a school in Daly City canceled classes after its aging sewer system backed up into the bathrooms. Dozens of school districts, state lawmakers and business groups have endorsed Proposition 51. Last week, the editorial board of The San Francisco Chronicle did too, calling it â€œa statewide commitment to the success of local schools. â€ While many opponents acknowledge a need to upgrade infrastructure, they say Proposition 51 is the wrong way to go about it. In February, Gov. Jerry Brown called it a â€œdevelopersâ€™ $9 billion bondâ€ that would deepen school inequity. The funding process favors schools that apply for projects early, meaning affluent districts with more seasoned administrators could muscle out poorer ones. â€œItâ€™s a blunderbuss effort that promotes sprawl and squanders money that would be far better spent in   communities,â€ Mr. Brown said. Critics argue that local districts are more than capable of issuing bonds of their own for schools and housing developers should shoulder more of the costs. The editorial boards of The Mercury News in San Jose and The San Diego   have opposed the initiative. The bond would cost Californians roughly $8. 6 billion in interest by the time it is paid off in 35 years. They would pay that bill through taxes, reductions in services or both. Californians tend to approve bonds for school upgrades, and a poll conducted in April suggested that they were likely to favor a statewide measure in November. If opponents hope to turn that tide, they have work to do. Want to go deeper? Dive into analyses by the Legislative Analystâ€™s Office and the League of Women Voters of California.

21268,"Obama Takes In a Broadway Show, but Shuns the Spotlight - The New York Times",Sopan Deb,"Barack Obama has kept a relatively low profile since leaving office last month, and he largely avoided the spotlight on Friday night  â€”   at least as much as a former president can when he is attending a Broadway show. Shortly after the lights went down at the American Airlines Theater on West 42nd Street, there was a blur, and the brief shining of a flashlight. Three people quickly took their seats several rows back from the stage: Mr. Obama his eldest daughter, Malia and Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser to the president. A woman sitting nearby let out a small yelp, but most of the audience at the revival of Arthur Millerâ€™s â€œThe Priceâ€™â€™ did not realize they were watching a Broadway show with someone who was, until recently, the most powerful person in the world. The play, starring Mark Ruffalo, Danny DeVito, Jessica Hecht and Tony Shalhoub, centers on two estranged brothers and their quest to reconnect. â€œWell, I actually didnâ€™t know he was sitting in the row,â€ said Laralyn Mowers, 37, who lives in Astoria, Queens. She was sitting five seats to the right of Mr. Obama and did not realize he was there until a friend told her at intermission. â€œI had a really bad day and it all just changed. â€ Ms. Mowers said she was actually irritated when the trio first came in. â€œWho is so rude to come in after the show starts with the flashlights and everything?â€ she said. Mr. Obama wore glasses during the show. At one point during the second act, he and his daughter sat in identical poses: right hands pressed to their chins while intently observing the drama before them. Just before intermission, again in darkness, Mr. Obama, his daughter and Ms. Jarrett were whisked backstage to greet the cast and to take pictures with the crew. Once more, most of the crowd was oblivious to his presence. After the play ended, the Obamas and Ms. Jarrett joined the crowd in a standing ovation for the cast, the most visible they had been all night. Minutes later, they were gone. The audience members who managed to see the former president were heard expressing surprise that he had been there. The Obamas have mostly kept out of sight since President Trumpâ€™s inauguration. After leaving office, Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama went to the British Virgin Islands at the invitation of Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group. Mr. Branson challenged him to a kitesurfing contest. Mr. Obama won.  Photos of a smiling Mr. Obama kitesurfing and wearing his baseball cap backward set off a flurry of jokes on the internet and on late night comedy shows. A common thread: Was he ever coming back? Mrs. Obama was spotted by the Daily Mail leaving a SoulCycle class in Washington this week. And on Thursday night, the former president was spotted leaving a restaurant with Malia in New York Cityâ€™s Little Italy. The Obamas have shown a fondness for Broadway. In 2009, Mr. Obama whisked Mrs. Obama away from Washington for a Saturday dinner and a theater date, taking in â€œJoe Turnerâ€™s Come and Gone. â€ Five years later, the Obamas attended a performance of â€œA Raisin in the Sun,â€ starring Denzel Washington. Mr. Obama took both of his daughters to see a matinee performance of â€œHamiltonâ€ in 2015. Last March, instead of leaving Washington, he brought â€œHamiltonâ€ cast members to the White House to perform and to conduct a workshop with high school students. In November, Mr. Obama appeared at a   for Democrats that featured a special performance of the hit musical. Of course, Mr. Obama is not alone among politicians who attend Broadway shows. Hillary Clinton has been spotted at four Broadway shows since her defeat in November, and was greeted with adulation. In an episode that garnered much attention, Mike Pence, then the vice   was treated by a cast member to a brief statement about inclusion after seeing â€œHamiltonâ€ in November. Mr. Trump, who helped finance a Broadway play in his 20s, and has said he is a fan of the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, was not pleased. During Fridayâ€™s performance of â€œThe Price,â€ a line from Mr. DeVitoâ€™s character, a furniture dealer, about the federal government being unreliable drew the biggest laugh of the night. Mr. Obama sat  . â€œHe said that he was happy that it was while he was not in office,â€ Mr. Ruffalo said during an interview after the show."
21269,DHS Authorizes Hiring 10K Immigration Officers,Bob Price,"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly authorized the hiring of an additional 10, 000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and enforcement officers. The move by DHS delivers on a promise made by President Donald Trump to increase enforcement â€”  particularly in removing criminal aliens inside the borders of the U. S.[Secretary Kelly ordered the director of ICE to immediately begin the process of hiring 10, 000 to effectively enforce the immigration laws in the interior regions of the U. S. according to a DHS memo obtained by Breitbart Texas. In addition, Kelly authorized the agency to hire additional operational and mission support staff, along with legal staff.  Kelly said the memo implements the Executive Order, â€œEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,â€ issued by President Trump on January 25. ICE agents and enforcement officers were used earlier this month to conduct a targeted roundup of criminal aliens in metropolitan areas across the country. Agents and officers arrested more than 600 criminal aliens in 11 states, Breitbart Texas reported. The operation spawned a rash of â€œfake newsâ€ reports, tweets, and other social media comments that sparked unnecessary fear among immigrants not in the sights of the targeted operation. â€œI believe ICE is out in public arresting people in order to retaliate against our community for standing up for our values against people like Abbott and Trump,â€ Austin City Councilman Casar posted on Facebook. â€œTrump and his allies will do everything they can to divide Americans, invoke fear in vulnerable neighborhoods, and demonize an entire community of people. â€ â€œOf those [680 aliens] arrested, approximately 75 percent were criminal aliens, convicted of crimes including, but not limited to, homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual assault of a minor, lewd and lascivious acts with a child, indecent liberties with a minor, drug trafficking, battery, assault, DUI and weapons charges,â€ Secretary Kelly wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ICE enforcement officers routinely execute targeted enforcement operations to remove violent criminal aliens from the country. The additional 10, 000 agents and officers will allow the DHS to more efficiently carry out its mission of enforcing immigration laws in the interior of the country. Some of the operations conducted in the past include (according to DHS statistics): The memorandum from Secretary Kelly is effective immediately.

21270,Prison Labor is Slavery by Another Name,Otherwords,"Prison Labor is Slavery by Another Name Prison Labor is Slavery by Another Name By 0 151 
Right now thereâ€™s a national movement mobilizing to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. But imagine if instead of earning even that much, you could only earn a few cents an hour. 
If that sounds like something from the developing world, think again. The reality is our prisons are perpetuating slave labor . 
Every day, incarcerated people work long hours for barely any money. Meanwhile, prisons charge inmates for everything from telephone calls, to extra food and convenience items, to occupying a bed. 
In an official statement announcing the start of the historically largest nationwide prison strike, the IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee wrote: â€œIn one voice, rising from the cells of long term solitary confinement, echoed in the dormitories and cell blocks from Virginia to Oregon, we prisoners across the United States vow to finally end slavery in 2016.â€ 
The prison system profits from mass incarceration. Prisons have numerous incentives to fill beds â€” including the cheap labor prisoners provide â€” and very little incentive to treat prisoners like human beings. (Photo: Shutterstock) 
Current minimum wage laws donâ€™t apply to people in prison, nor do labor rights regulations. So prisoners experiencing grueling hours or cruel treatment donâ€™t have any recourse to file complaints or seek restitution. 
On the contrary, clear human rights violations â€“ including chain gangs â€” go unchecked all the time. 
And the prison system targets an already incredibly vulnerable population. Most inmates arenâ€™t just low-income â€” theyâ€™re the poorest of the poor. In 2014, prior to their incarceration, inmates generally made over 40 percent less than their peers. 
Much of the prison population only wound up in the system in the first place because of policies that criminalize race, poverty, and mental health. 
Some are there because they couldnâ€™t afford to post bail after facing minimal charges. Others end up back in the system because of stigma and policies that make it difficult to find a job as an ex-convict. 
Others still are locked up for being homeless and sleeping on the street, or stealing food. Many with mental illnesses end up cycling between the emergency room and a jail cell. 
But even those with steady work, once inside prison, canâ€™t continue to earn a decent living. On just a few pennies an hour, prisoners canâ€™t support themselves or their families, or earn enough to survive once they reenter society. 
People who spend years or even decades behind bars lose years worth of wages and have few resources for food or rent post-incarceration. Itâ€™s easy to see how prisons trap people in a cycle of poverty that helps ensure that even if released, theyâ€™re likely to end up back in prison. 
The majority of these prisoners are people of color whoâ€™ve been disproportionately targeted for imprisonment â€” from racial profiling to the failed war on drugs that targeted black communities starting in the 1980s. 
And itâ€™s not just the wages that are reminiscent of slavery. 
One in ten prisoners is subject to physical and sexual abuse by guards and fellow inmates, according to the first National Former Prisoners Survey . 
Thereâ€™s no real infrastructure to address the physical and mental consequences that come with this abuse. Meanwhile, prison wardens, correction officers, and prison administrators are rarely held accountable for their actions. 
Some of these injustices have inspired the Department of Justice to end federal contracts with private prisons, but thatâ€™s not enough. 
The Eighth Amendment states that cruel and unusual punishment is illegal in this country. Yet, today people are slaving away in prison factories, under working conditions that first prompted the rise of the labor movement. 
Prisoners are human beings who deserve the same human rights and dignity as the rest of us. 
We must end the practice of prison labor. Itâ€™s slavery by another name, and we have a clear obligation to ensure that slavery is completely eradicated in the United States."
21271,Michigan Allots $87 Million to Replace Flintâ€™s Tainted Water Pipes - The New York Times,Julie Bosman,"The State of Michigan has agreed to spend $87 million in a proposed settlement to replace thousands of lead pipes throughout Flint over the next three years, the latest effort by state and city officials to fix the contaminated water system. The state may use a combination of federal and state funds for the project, which, if approved, would settle a lawsuit brought last year by a coalition of Flint residents and national groups. The suit blamed city and state officials for failing to protect residents from drinking   water for more than a year. A federal judge is expected to review the agreement during a hearing in Detroit on Tuesday. The proposed deal also calls for the state to provide free bottled water and to conduct extensive testing of Flintâ€™s tap water for lead in the coming months. By January 2020, the agreement says, the city will have replaced pipes in and around thousands of homes  â€”   perhaps 18, 000 of them  â€”   speeding up a project that began last year to replace corroded lead pipes. Pipes made of lead or galvanized steel are expected to be replaced with copper. â€œThis proposed agreement is a win for the people of Flint,â€ said Dimple Chaudhary, a lawyer for the National Resources Defense Council. â€œIt provides a comprehensive framework to address lead contamination in Flintâ€™s tap water. The agreement is a significant step forward for the Flint community, covering a number of critical issues related to water safety. â€ The lawsuit was filed against Michigan and Flint officials in January 2016 by a group including the Natural Resources Defense Council the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan Concerned Pastors for Social Action and Melissa Mays, a Flint resident. The group asserted that the state and the city were in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Ari Adler, a spokesman for Gov. Rick Snyder, said he could not comment because the agreement was still under mediation. Under the terms of the deal, residents are entitled to lead testing of their water four times a year. Residents who are homebound may receive deliveries of bottled water, and nine distribution centers will offer free bottled water, filters and replacement cartridges for filters. Teams dispatched by the city will inspect water filters on faucets, ensure that they are installed correctly and explain proper use to residents, a step to further educate people in Flint about lead contamination. In April 2014, Flint officials switched the cityâ€™s water source from Detroitâ€™s water system to the Flint River, and residents immediately began to report health problems, water discoloration and foul smells from their faucets. It took more than a year before state officials publicly acknowledged the problem. Experts said that water from the Flint River had corroded the pipes and caused lead to leach into the water. Jacob D. Abernethy, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, collaborated with Flint officials on a study last year that analyzed the water system and the undertaking to replace lead pipes in homes. He said that finishing the replacement in three years seemed possible with enough money and resources. The pipe replacement in Flint did not begin as quickly as officials had initially hoped. â€œItâ€™s been a slow project for a lot of reasons,â€ Mr. Abernethy said. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of hurdles in the way: The City Council has to approve the locations. Every time you want to go to a home, you have to get approval from the homeowner. Contractors encounter problems they didnâ€™t expect to find. â€ But after months of construction, he said, officials in Flint â€œhave figured out how to make this thing go fast. â€"
21272,"In a California Valley, Healthy Food Everywhere but on the Table - The New York Times",Thomas Fuller,"SALINAS, Calif.  â€”   As Americans gather around Thanksgiving tables, chances are that the healthier parts of their menus  â€”   the tossed salads, broccoli casseroles or steaming bowls of roasted brussels sprouts  â€”   were grown here in the Salinas Valley. A long strip of deep and fertile soil pinched by sharply rising mountains, the valley has more than doubled its output of produce in recent decades and now grows well over half of Americaâ€™s leaf lettuce. Yet one place the valleyâ€™s bounty of antioxidants does not often appear is on the tables of the migrant workers who harvest it. Public health officials here describe a crisis of poverty and malnutrition among the tens of thousands of farmworkers and their families who tend to the fields of lettuce, broccoli, celery, cauliflower and spinach, among many other crops, in an area called the salad bowl of the nation. More than a third of the children in the Salinas City Elementary School District are homeless overall diabetes rates are rising and projected to soar and 85 percent of farmworkers in the valley are overweight or obese, partly because unhealthy food is less costly, said Marc B. Schenker, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the health of farmworkers. â€œThe people who grow our food canâ€™t afford to eat it, and they are sicker because of it,â€ said Joel Diringer, a public health specialist and advocate for farmworkers. â€œItâ€™s an incredible irony that those who work in the fields all day long donâ€™t have access to the fresh produce that they harvest. â€ For decades, the fields of the Salinas Valley have been a revolving door of migrants, from the Okies of John Steinbeckâ€™s writings to the Latin American immigrants who tend the fields today.   percent of farmworkers in California are foreign born, primarily from Mexico, according to the United States Department of Labor. While the valleyâ€™s vegetables are reaching an   number of American households, public health officials say there are no signs of improvement in the living conditions and diets of farmworkers. The popularity of sugary drinks and cultural preferences for filling but   foods like tacos and tamales contribute to the obesity of farmworkers and their families, public health officials say. Because an estimated half of agricultural workers in the Salinas Valley are in the country illegally, many do not have health insurance and go without treatment until symptoms become acute. The combination of high rents and low incomes  â€”   wages typically fall in the range of $10 to $15 an hour  â€”   leaves farmworkers with minimal and often inadequate money for food and is a contributor to the housing crisis in Salinas. Homelessness has risen so steadily in recent years that the Salinas City Elementary School District now has a liaison for students without permanent housing. Cheryl Camany, the school districtâ€™s homeless liaison, listed the types of dwellings where some farmworkers slept: â€œTents, encampments, abandoned buildings,â€ she said. â€œThey could be living in a toolshed, a chicken coop. â€ Poverty and neglect among farmworkers is by no means new. Steinbeck, the valleyâ€™s most famous native son, wrote in the 1930s about the â€œcurious attitude toward a group that makes our agriculture successful. â€ â€œThe migrants are needed, and they are hated,â€ he wrote, a sentiment that residents here feel has been revived with the election of Donald J. Trump as president and his promises to deport undocumented workers. At a diabetes and nutrition awareness class held at a nursery school in King City, overweight women from farmworker families were given a barrage of statistics on the dangers of poor diets, especially those excessive in sugar. â€œTwo in five Americans will develop diabetes,â€ Lisa Rico, the instructor, told the class in Spanish. â€œBut for us itâ€™s one in two. â€ The class was run by the Natividad Medical Foundation, a nonprofit that is part of Natividad Medical Center, a large hospital in Salinas. Ms. Rico read to the class the findings of a survey of 1, 200 young people in Monterey County, which includes Salinas: 72 percent of children under 10 years old and 83 percent of teenagers said they drank at least one soda a day adolescents drank 4. 5 times as many sugary drinks as water. A study published in March by the U. C. L. A. Center for Health Policy Research reported that 57 percent of residents in Monterey County had diabetes or prediabetes, just slightly above the California average of 55 percent. But Dr. Dana Kent, the medical director for health promotion and education at the Natividad Medical Foundation, said estimates among farmworkers might be low, especially among those who are undocumented and fearful to obtain medical services. â€œWe get a sense that there are a lot of people out there who are undiagnosed,â€ Dr. Kent said. On a recent afternoon, workers from Mexico and El Salvador harvested heads of iceberg lettuce in a field in Gonzales, a city in the heart of the Salinas Valley. The workers moved so quickly  â€”   slicing, trimming the outer leaves and putting the heads of lettuce into plastic bags  â€”   that they looked like actors in a film played at an accelerated speed. Angelica Beltran, the supervisor, said her workers typically ate six to eight tacos while at work and had two or three sodas during their shift. â€œNo one drinks diet soda,â€ she said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t taste good. â€ Despite the frenetic pace of the work, farmworkers suffer from what Melissa Kendrick, the head of the Food Bank for Monterey County, calls the â€œobesity paradox of the poor. â€ â€œThey are fat, yes, but they are malnourished because all they are eating is garbage,â€ she said. The consumption of cheap, starchy food has been a major contributor to the epidemic of obesity across America. But the rates among farmworkers here are significantly higher: 85 percent are overweight or obese compared with 69 percent nationally. Some farmworkers in the Salinas Valley sleep next to the vegetables they cannot afford to buy. In a row of dusty,   apartments straddled by railway tracks and vast fields of broccoli, Maria Hernandez, 60, pays $520 a month for two tiny rooms, each about 18 feet across. Her extended family are Mexican immigrants who have spent their lives farming and picking strawberries, celery and other crops. She became aware of the need to eat healthily when both her mother and her sister were diagnosed with diabetes. â€œAlthough we are surrounded by it, we donâ€™t eat it because itâ€™s expensive,â€ said Antonia Tejada, Ms. Hernandezâ€™s daughter, who works the night shift at McDonaldâ€™s. â€œWe will buy a big bag of beans instead of a little thing of broccoli for $2 that wonâ€™t feed even one person. â€ Only an hour south of Silicon Valley, the Salinas Valley is a rural setting with urban prices. Israel de Jesus, who works as an interpreter at the Natividad Medical Center in Salinas, crowded into a home that rented for $1, 600 a month when he was doing farm work. â€œThereâ€™s no way to save money because of the bills and the rent,â€ Mr. de Jesus said. â€œBut you have to save money so you can make it through the winter. â€ Even when vegetables and other healthy foods are available or affordable, farmworkers sometimes opt for the satisfaction of comfort food. Brigita Gonzalez rises every day at 3:30 a. m. to prepare food for her husband, who leaves for the fields an hour later. When she made him a salad once to accompany his tacos, he returned in the evening with the salad unfinished. Ms. Gonzalez says her husband was needled by   for eating a salad: â€œEverybody was like, â€˜What are you eating? â€™â€ Ms. Kendrick of the food bank said demand was strong for healthy foods, cultural preferences notwithstanding. The food bank gives out about five million meals a year and is raising money to build a large food warehouse on a   plot. Ms. Kendrick, who previously worked in Silicon Valley, said she was motivated by the idea that malnutrition and hunger were fixable in a country with so much wealth. â€œIâ€™ve spent time in India, the Middle East, Southeast Asia  â€”   third world countries where poverty is everywhere,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s shocking when itâ€™s in your home state. â€"
21273,N.H.L. Says Its Players Will Not Participate in 2018 Winter Olympics - The New York Times,Ben Shpigel,"T. J. Oshie dominating in a thrilling United States shootout victory over Russia. Sidney Crosby scoring an overtime goal on home ice to lift Canada to the gold medal over the United States. Henrik Lundqvist stretching across the goal line with seconds remaining to secure gold for Sweden. Some of the more memorable moments in Olympic hockey history have involved N. H. L. players, but new ones will probably have to be forged without them next winter in South Korea. Citing a majority of ownersâ€™ overwhelming opposition to disrupting the regular season, the N. H. L. announced Monday that it would not participate in the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, depriving the Games of the worldâ€™s best players in a showcase sport. Players in the N. H. L. have participated in every Olympics since 1998, and many have expressed interest in playing at next winterâ€™s Games. Lundqvist, the Rangersâ€™ stellar goaltender, said on Twitter that the leagueâ€™s decision wasted â€œa huge opportunity to market the game at the biggest stageâ€ and that he was disappointed â€œfor all the players that canâ€™t be part of the most special adventure in sports. â€ The Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin has said he plans to represent Russia at the Pyeongchang Games no matter what the N. H. L. might decide, raising the possibility that the next battle for the owners might be with individual players who do not want to obey the league. The National Hockey League Playersâ€™ Association said in a statement that players were â€œextraordinarily disappointed and adamantly disagreeâ€ with the leagueâ€™s decision. â€œN. H. L. players are patriotic and they do not take this lightly,â€ the association said. â€œA decent respect for the opinions of the players matters. This is the N. H. L. â€™s decision, and its alone. It is very unfortunate for the game, the players and millions of loyal hockey fans. â€ N. H. L. owners and officials do not like the idea of shutting down the league for a few weeks. They have argued that they deserve a portion of the revenue that the International Olympic Committee receives from the tournament, and they do not like the injury risk. Several stars, among them Islanders center John Tavares and Red Wings center Henrik Zetterberg, sustained   injuries at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. â€œThe league isnâ€™t â€ N. H. L. Commissioner Gary Bettman told Chicago business leaders last month. â€œWeâ€™ve been to five of them. The problem is the clubs are   to the season. To disappear for almost three weeks in February when thereâ€™s no football, no baseball, thereâ€™s only basketball and us. To do it where thereâ€™s no programming for the NHL Network, for NHL. com, for all of our social media platforms  â€”   we just disappear. â€ The United States Olympic Committee responded to the decision with a statement posted on its website: â€œWeâ€™re disappointed that the N. H. L. has decided not to participate and feel for the players who were looking forward to the Games. That said, weâ€™re confident U. S. A. Hockey will build the   team to compete and win in Pyeongchang. â€ Bettman has been hinting at a potential Olympic absence for about a year, telling reporters before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals last May that â€œour teams are not interested in paying for the privilegeâ€ of participating. The N. H. L. endorsed another global event, the World Cup of Hockey, held in Canada in September. The competition ended two weeks before the season, and coupled with mandated   breaks for each team, it created a compressed schedule comparable to that of an Olympic year. Players and coaches have complained that the schedule has led to fatigue and poor play. The N. B. A. is the only other one of the four major North American sports leagues that sends its players to the Olympics, but basketball is contested at the Summer Games, during the leagueâ€™s  . When baseball was a medal sport, from 1992 to 2008, Major League Baseball would not permit its players to compete for similar reasons as the N. H. L. â€™s: a lengthy interruption of an inflexible schedule that would cost owners and the playersâ€™ association about three weeksâ€™ worth of revenue. Minor leaguers and college players competed instead, as could be the case with the hockey teams for the United States and Canada in Pyeongchang. â€œWe knew it was a very real possibility for many months and certainly respect the decision of the N. H. L. ,â€ Dave Ogrean, executive director of U. S. A. Hockey, said in a statement. â€œThe good news is that because of our   efforts over the course of many years, our player pool is as deep as it has ever been, and we fully expect to field a team that will play for a medal. â€ The president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, RenÃ© Fasel, said recently that the federation needed the N. H. L. â€™s decision on 2018 by the end of April. Though the N. H. L. â€™s statement on Monday ended with â€œWe now consider the matter officially closed,â€ it remains to be seen whether the decision is, in fact, final. Negotiations for the 2014 Sochi Olympics stalled four years ago, but an agreement was reached on July 19, 2013, less than seven months before the opening ceremony. Furthermore, although the N. H. L. said in its statement that the I. O. C. had let it be known that the leagueâ€™s participation in the 2022 Beijing Games was contingent on its presence in Pyeongchang, the league is striving to make inroads in China. Refusing to send its players there could ruin an opportunity to tap a new market. Last week, Bettman traveled to China to announce that the Vancouver Canucks and the Los Angeles Kings would play two exhibition games there in September, in Shanghai and Beijing, where the Kontinental Hockey League of Russia recently installed a team. In its statement, the N. H. L. said it had been open to hearing from the I. O. C. the I. I. H. F. and the playersâ€™ association on ways to make Olympic participation more attractive to the team owners. â€œA number of months have now passed, and no meaningful dialogue has materialized,â€ the N. H. L. said. The I. O. C. which had previously paid travel and insurance expenses for N. H. L. players, had said it would not do so for the 2018 Games. The I. I. H. F. stepped in to cover those costs instead, but that concession did not satisfy the league."
21274,Now is the Best Time to Start Seeds For Spring,Ariana,"Leeks 

Vegetables that do not like to be disturbed include many of the root vegetable varieties such as Carrots, Beets, Turnips, and Parsnips. Many of the root vegetables are cold-hearty and can withstand colder temperatures, and therefore be directly planted in the ground as soon as temperatures are above 39 F for the season. Several vegetables that are a bit trickier include corn, beans, and peas. These vegetables have a much more sensitive root system and do well when they are directly planted into the ground once the season has come, after the last frost when temperatures begin to warm and sunlight increases. 

When your seedlings have matured enough and the temperature outside is warming, it is time to start thinking about getting your vegetables outside and into the garden. This typically happens after the last frost, when the outdoor temperature is above 59 F. If nighttime temperatures drop a lot lower than this, wait another week or two. 

Cold weather can rot seedlings and shock them, even killing tender crops. Once you are confident that temperatures and weather outside is optimal, begin to harden your seedlings and prep them for transplanting. 

To do this, place your seedlings outside in a shaded area with filtered light and slowly, over the course of a week, expose them to more and more sunlight. Seedlings grown indoors are usually quite fragile and soft, and need time to harden before being planted outside in the ground. 

Once your seedlings have been planted in the ground, ensure that they are watered immediately. Some may droop or wilt as a result of being transplanted, but most will rebound after they have had time to adjust to their move. Be sure not to over water new transplants because they will be unable to use all the moisture around them and soon rot. 

Starting seedlings inside will give you a fun activity to do indoors and your garden will thank you in spring!

21275,Muslim College Chaplains Extend a Hand Across Religious Divides - The New York Times,Samuel G. Freedman,"MINNEAPOLIS  â€”   Emma Blom grew up in the Scandinavian heartland of rural Minnesota, reliably attending her small townâ€™s Lutheran church. She spent each childhood summer in vacation Bible school and played the piano for Sunday worship services. â€œBorning Cryâ€ was her grandmotherâ€™s favorite hymn. Catholics were a scattered minority on the Minnesota prairie, Jews even rarer. As for Muslims, Ms. Blom had never met one. â€œI knew the women wore stuff on their head,â€ she recalled. â€œI didnâ€™t even know it was called a hijab. â€ Then, as a sophomore at Augsburg College here in 2014, Ms. Blom felt her faith wavering. She had been shaken by her grandmotherâ€™s death, and drew no solace from her churchâ€™s rituals. One of her classes scrutinized the Bible for sexism and misogyny. Was she a Christian anymore? Was she even a believer? She didnâ€™t dare to ask any of her Lutheran friends, for fear of being judged and found wanting. Still struggling this fall, Ms. Blom turned to perhaps the most unexpected counselor and confessor of all: Augsburgâ€™s Muslim chaplain, Fardosa Hassan. And from Ms. Hassan, 26, a Somali refugee who had never seen snow until arriving in Minnesota as a    entering fifth grade, Ms. Blom heard words that sustained her. Doubt was the necessary companion of belief, Ms. Hassan assured her, not its irreversible solvent. Divine texts can be interpreted by human hands and in modern ways. One devout personâ€™s truth is not necessarily anotherâ€™s. Two months after the conversation, Ms. Blom is attending church again, feeling more settled in her soul. In this encounter across chasms of difference, Ms. Hassan embodied the vital role that dozens of Muslim chaplains like her are playing at colleges and universities throughout the nation. These chaplains serve as doors that open two ways  â€”   welcoming and integrating Muslim students who fear hostility at a time of rising Islamophobia, and normalizing Islam to   students who have absorbed a narrative of it as an oppressive and violent religion. â€œMy role is to help students negotiate this multifaith, diverse environment,â€ said Ms. Hassan. â€œIâ€™m going to give them a tool for when they go out of this institution, so they know how to be respectful of others. A lot of times, people are afraid even to ask the questions of people who are different. So I say, begin with friendship. Start by saying hello. â€ Across the United States, nearly 40 Muslim chaplains serve private universities, according to Abdullah Antepli, the chaplain at Duke University and a leader in the national association of Muslim chaplains, which also includes those serving in hospitals, the military, prisons and various community settings. (For reasons of church and state separation, public universities cannot pay for clergy of any kind, although a Muslim chaplain at the University of Michigan is supported by private donations.) Virtually all these chaplains have been hired since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. In their polarizing aftermath, the chaplains both chose and were compelled to become cultural and religious interlocutors. For   each one of those chaplains provided a face, if not the face, of the â€œummah,â€ or global community of Islam. â€œIf you have a Muslim among the Jews and Christians and Buddhists and humanists, you get better integrated into the life of the school,â€ said Heidi Hadsell, the president of Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, which has a program to train Muslim chaplains. â€œThey act as advocates for Muslim students, but also a bridge to other communities. And thatâ€™s critically important. Itâ€™s a way of people on campus knowing a Muslim. â€ There is probably no college that stands more astride the religious divide than Augsburg. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and has traditionally attracted the vast majority of its students from white Protestant denominations. Yet its campus directly abuts the   neighborhood that is the epicenter of Minnesotaâ€™s population of 31, 500 Somali Muslims. Perhaps nowhere else in the United States does a hockey rink sit so close to a halal meat market. With the growth of Minnesotaâ€™s Somali population over the past   the most common national news from the area has concerned the dozens of young men who joined the Islamic State or the Shabab militant group  â€”   or were apprehended trying. In September, a Somali man shouting â€œAllahu akbarâ€ stabbed 10 people at a shopping mall in St. Cloud, 65 miles from Minneapolis, heightening fears of homegrown terrorism. Such explosive events, though, obscure the less dramatic assimilation of Somali immigrants here. One serves on the Minneapolis City Council. Another won a seat in the state legislature on Election Day. As of 2006, Somalis in Minnesota owned 600 businesses and had $164 million in buying power, according to a report by the American Immigration Council, and those numbers have certainly increased in the subsequent decade. So when  Paul C. Pribbenow became president of Augsburg in 2006, he looked to the Somali community for prospective students. Having written his doctoral dissertation about Hull House, Jane Addamsâ€™s landmark settlement house in Chicago, Dr. Pribbenow conceived of Augsburg as the â€œ  equivalent. â€ As he recently put it: â€œWhat does a settlement house do? It listens to neighbors and learns how to be a neighbor. â€ With a student body of about 2, 500, Augsburgâ€™s Muslim enrollment increased to 101 in 2016 from 11 in 2007. Ms. Hassan, in the graduating class of 2012, was one of those students. Her family fled Somaliaâ€™s civil war in 1991 and lived in Ethiopia and Kenya for several years before she came to Minneapolis in the care of her grandmother. Equipped with a bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology and international relations, Ms. Hassan went to work for an interfaith   group in St. Paul. Augsburg, meanwhile, got a harrowing reminder of its lingering gaps in meeting the needs of Muslim students when one was shot and killed near campus in 2008. The college pastor, the Rev. Sonja Hagander, realized to her shame that there was no Muslim religious figure on campus to help students grieve. As a Lutheran, she felt almost an impostor in the role. So when Augsburg created a position of Muslim student program associate, Ms. Hassan applied and was hired in August 2015. In the role, she addresses classes, organizes service projects, leads field trips to local mosques and started a service for Friday Prayers, known as jummah, on campus. She also makes sure there are plenty of Doritos when members of the Muslim Student Association turn up for their meetings. For Ms. Hassan, such efforts are necessarily   . If a Christian student like Ms. Blom represented one vector of her outreach, then Mohamud Mohamed typifies the other. The son of Somali refugees, he memorized the Quran by age 13 and began teaching in a weekend madrasa a year later. His default position before he went to college was to assume that the most rigorous version of Islam was the most genuine. At Augsburg, Ms. Hassan utilized Mr. Mohamedâ€™s religious training to have him, rather than an outside imam, lead Friday Prayer. She also nudged him to move the sermons away from fire and brimstone and toward issues of social justice, such as the Black Lives Matter movement. As a result, the prayer service has begun to attract some Christian and atheist students for its political message. And in at least one small way on one campus, Islam itself has been demystified and defanged. â€œThey feel like thereâ€™s no more mystery about it,â€ Mr. Mohamed, 19, said of   students. â€œItâ€™s not some secret ritual. Itâ€™s a way for us to be ambassadors for Muslims. â€"
21276,"NATO Goes On High Alert To Block Donald Trump Presidency, Put Hillary Clinton In Power",The European Union Times,"
A gravely written Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin this morning is warning the Security Council ( SC ) that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) has now placed upwards of 300,000 of its military forces on â€œhigh alertâ€ that this Western allianceâ€™s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg claims is due to growing tensions with Russia â€”but that Federation intelligence analysts state are intended to be used, instead, for a full-scale invasion of the United States to prevent Donald Trump from assuming the presidency. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, MoD intelligence analysts became â€œconcerned/alarmedâ€ over a 25 October US military joint air defense exercise in the Arabian Sea that coordinated US Navy aircraft carrier defense of US Air Force transport and refueling aircraftâ€”but that further analysis revealed was but a precursor to a much larger planned American military â€œeventâ€ scheduled for 14 December as part of the Pentagonâ€™s planning for the upcoming inauguration of their next president.
The Pentagonâ€™s planning for their 14 December â€œeventâ€, this report continues, involves the Atlantic Ocean deployment between the United States and European Union of the aircraft carriers USS George H.W. Bush , USS George Washington and USS Abraham Lincoln whose fighter aircraft will be defending the US Air Forcesâ€™ Air Mobility Commandâ€™s ( AMC ) staggering deployment of 200 KC-135 Stratotanker air-to-air fueling aircraft, 150 C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, 150 C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and 75 C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraftâ€”all of which are â€œplanned/scheduledâ€ to leave the US empty, and return fully loaded.
Raising MoD â€œfears/concernsâ€ even more about this planned Pentagon â€œeventâ€, this report notes, is all of the US military commanders involved in it being given copies of a cryptically written Executive Order signed by President Obama 3 days ago (4 November) that states â€œ global health security is a core tenet of our national strategy for countering biological threats â€ and directs the US Defense Department and US Secretary of State to cooperate, coordinate and communicate with unnamed foreign defense ministries .
With relations between the United States and the equally globalist European Union hanging in the balance as the majority of the EUâ€™s leaders fear a Donald Trump presidency , this report continues, many in the US are openly warning that Hillary Clinton, and the leftist forces loyal to her, are preparing to stage a â€œ false flag â€ attack to regain their hold on powerâ€”including one of the most feared and powerful American political operatives named Roger Stone who is, likewise, openly warning it could very well happen.
As to why Hillary Clinton fears a Donald Trump presidency, MoD intelligence analysts in this report explain, is due to the massive exposure to the American public of her many crimesâ€”including her cover-up of child rape and sex trafficking.
Making Hillary Clintonâ€™s dire situation even worse, this report continues, was FBI Director James Comey, yesterday, basically informing her that he wasnâ€™t prepared to indict her for her email crimesâ€”but that US government â€œdeep stateâ€ sources are now leaking was a â€œploy/gambitâ€ to keep President Obama from pardoning her before Donald Trump could assume the presidency.
With Hillary Clinton having disgraced the entire journalism profession in America for decades to come, this report says, these propagandists crimes against the citizens of US continue to astound the whole worldâ€”including the once respected television news network CNN now being proven to have colluded with Clinton to destroy Donald Trump.
But to one of the greatest crimes against the American people these Hillary Clinton propagandist journalists are responsible for, this report says, is their failing to tell them that her top aide, Huma Abedin, is, in fact, an imbedded spy bought and paid for by Saudi Arabia that the Federation has warned the US government about for decades.
But to the shockingly worse crime being committed against the American people, this report concludes, is President Obama himself now openly calling for all illegal immigrants in the United States to vote for Hillary Clinton, and pledging that the corrupt government he now controls will do nothing about it.
And though not mentioned in this MoD report, there are no greater examples of how corrupt the Obama-Clinton regime has made America then the cases of a young California single mother named Mariza Reulas who is facing years in prison for the crime of selling a single supper to a member of her ladies food club and the destruction of MIT professor Cesar Hidalgo for daring to tell to the truth about Clintonâ€™s emailsâ€”both occurring while Hillary Clinton, and all of the criminals associated with her, are still able to walk freeâ€”but if Donald Trump is allowed to survive he may be able to save, along with the United States itself.

21277,Trumpâ€™s â€œConservative Revolutionâ€ (A view from Oz),The Saker,"2142 Views November 16, 2016 35 Comments Guest Posts The Saker 
by Iman Safi 
The major political parties of Western democracies; the Conservatives on one hand and the Liberal Progressives on the other hand, irrespective what specific names they give themselves, are by-and-large based on the â€œtraditionalâ€ so-called right versus left divide. 
This divide has taken many shapes and forms, and of course a huge array of names and descriptions, and this is why to pinpoint the doctrinal difference between them, it is perhaps best go back to the basic difference of conservatism versus liberalism; the desire to maintain as opposed to the desire to change. 
This is basically why political preference was grossly gravitated to by the norms of human nature. Thus, the privileged were attracted to conservatism whilst the underprivileged were lured by the need for change. 
In this rapid time of change, change at all levels, those sharp dividing lines have been merging at times and splitting at others. In their denial to this paradigm shift, the major parties in the West have lost what originally defined them; and when their constituents tell them that they do not see any difference between them any longer, instead of listening to them, they shun them and tell them that they are wrong. 
It is of little wonder therefore that new kids are coming on the block; new kids who can strike in the weakest spot of the underbelly of the major parties, and they strike when the eyes of the major parties are either closed, or at best, in denial. 
Enter the Greens. 
As both major parties move closer towards the center, or at least as they are perceived to do so, gaps are created at the extremes of the conservative-progressive divide. Even if the major parties are not indeed either moving closer or towards the center, the fact that they are perceived to do so by voters is enough reason to send votes swaying in any direction as perceived. 
The Greens were quick enough and smart enough to capitalize on one of the perceived vacuum corners and jumped into the left progressive former nook. Fairly quickly they came to embody what the traditional progressive left side of politics used to uphold and defend, and was supposed to continue to do so. Thus, in a rather short period of time, just 2-3 decades in fact, the Greens vote now accounts to nearly 10% in most Western democracies, and it is on the rise. 
On the other extreme, the protagonists of the extreme right, had to wait a bit longer for a more opportune moment. The wave of refugees and ensuing terrorism that the short-sighted politics and the wars that both major parties created gave them the golden goose they had been waiting for. 
Ironically however, in most Western nations, many major new concerns, including the concern about refugees, come from both the very privileged and the very underprivileged combined. The two diametrically-opposite socio-economic dipoles found quite a bit of common ground that united them. Thus, and perhaps for the first time in history, the desire to change did not come exclusively from the bottom. The days of the French Revolution seem to have gone. The days of hungry people taking to the streets demanding bread are long forgotten. 
This created the foundation of the Trumpâ€™s â€œConservative Revolutionâ€. Whilst this term sounds oxymoronic, it describes the status quo of the paradigm shift that major parties in all Western nations are seemingly and conveniently choosing to ignore to their own peril. The â€œConservative Revolutionâ€ is a new social phenomenon, originating from both extreme of the socio-economic divide crashing the center and the rot that traditional politics has festered around the mid-point shades of grey. 
The muddled up and muddied new scenario is something that traditional conservative and progressive parties are not used to. In their tradition of assuming that power is exclusive for either one of them for the taking, they have built a high and huge wall of arrogance that they do not seem to want to surmount. 
For some reason, they seem to believe that their self-perceived oppositeness is as real and as permanent as black and white. It is time that they realize that they are both seen as, with the risk of repetition, slightly different shades of grey and that there is a new clearer brand of black and white emerging. For some mysterious reason they believe that their presence is etched in stone that they will always be here, and that even when in opposition, it is only a question of time before they get re-elected and voted in. 
It is time that they wake up, and get a reality check. 
In Trumpâ€™s â€œConservative Revolutionâ€, not even the American Republican Party (ie the GOP) had fully endorsed him, and ultimately, for better or for worse, his win was his own; not the GOPâ€™s. Above all, Trump used primarily his own funds, and in more ways than one, he owes nothing to none, none at all but his loyal inner circle and, of course, his voters nationwide. 
So apart from Trump and his close inner circle, who are those who believe that they are the winners in the USA? Obviously and sadly, the ultra-right including the KKK and the like, and this is the main cause of fear and concern among the ranks of the truly educated liberal-minded Americans, and for good reasons. They simply do not know what to expect next. 
It is no wonder therefore that the rest of the Western World is at loss trying to deal with the Trump win tsunami. 
Right here in Australia, even the staunch ultra-right Australian former PM John Howard, a prime mover and shaker who was instrumental in pursuing Bush to invade Iraq, is at loss and in total despair facing Trumpâ€™s win. Traditionally after a GOP win, this man should now be rejoicing. After all, he was the one who said eight years ago that Al-Qaeda would be happy to see Obama win. But thus far, Trump does not give the impression that he is the regular conservative warmonger that Howard likes to see in the Oval Office. Quite the contrary in fact. 
The world is changing and changing fast. The biggest paradigm shift after the end of WWII was the breakup of the USSR and the establishment of the so-called â€œNew World Orderâ€ in which the USA was the sole superpower. 
The â€œNew World Orderâ€ is coming to an end. In fact, it already did when Russia unilaterally decided to send its Sukhois to bomb ISIS in Syria. 
The economic strife that the USA is suffering from, its shrinking global influence and needless and expensive wars that it had been engaged with almost continuously since the end of WWII has reached a tipping point that President-elect Trump is savvy enough to acknowledge, and forward enough to openly and overtly decide that he wants to deal with in a fiscally-pragmatic and conciliatory manner. 
Unless Trump does an Obama and changes course soon after his inauguration, a new era in foreign American policy, an era that is primarily America-centric rather than hegemonic will set the course of global events in a new direction. 
Other nations, and specifically the two major parties of Western democracies will have very few choices. They will either have to acknowledge and accept this change, find a way in which they can redefine themselves in order to be able to find a nook for themselves within it, or simply stick to their waning guns and allow to fall to 3 rd and 4 th ranks in power and allow the Greens and new ultra-right to become the two new de-facto major parties. The ball is in their courts, but not for a long time. 
The longer they take to redefine themselves, and the longer they continue to bury their heads in the sand, the Greens will continue to chew away votes from the progressive parties and the ultra-right will do the same from the conservative parties. As a matter of fact, in this particular unprecedented situation, the major parties can lose votes in any direction, but mostly towards the one seen closer to them. 
Unless the major parties wake up, and they are the devil the West knows, the West will soon find itself under the control of either the far right or the far left; the devils that no one really knows, let alone, wants to know. 
To be explicit and specific, in Australia this will mean that unless the ruling Liberal-National Coalition on one hand and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) on the other hand reach a new bi-partisan foreign policy agreement that will endeavour to sever the unconditional and rather outdated loyalty to the America tag, a tag that the USA itself is possibly no longer interested in keeping, then in the not too distant future when Australians go to the polling booths, they will eventually have to choose between either the Greens or the infamous xenophobic Pauline Hanson One Nation Party. 
Not surprisingly, the ruling Australian conservative government is at a total loss because it is now facing the prospect of having to contend with the love-child of the â€œConservative Revolutionâ€, an American President that they have not seen the likes of before, someone they cannot place in any position on the right to left track; definitely not in any position they are familiar with. Prime Minister Turnbull had no option but to congratulate the President-elect in a rather morbid manner that, when looked at in between the lines, one would argue that Turnbull might as well have said that Australia will accept the decision of the American people even if they vote in a moron and a thug. 
On the other hand, former opposition ALP leaders, two of whom are former Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Kevin Rudd have genuinely welcomed the change. Another former ALP leader who never reached the top job, Mark Latham, was excited to see that this change may mean that the USA will no longer be the world police. But Keating put it very strongly when he urged Australia to act like a grown-up nation and sever the unconditional loyalty to the America tag ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=share&v=paPrAG6IY_8&app=desktop ). 
I have not been scanning who has been saying what, but I would not be surprised if what Paul Keating had to say was quite unique and not matched with any post US-election statements coming from any Western leader or former leader. 
Once the fears resulting from Trumpâ€™s pre-election statements about women, Hispanics, Muslims etcâ€¦ are dissipated, if they get dissipated, and if he remains true to his word on international policy, Western leaders of the conservative and progressive parties that rule in alternation will have to redefine and realign themselves, otherwise they may either get squeezed into oblivion or swept away by their own home-grown â€œConservative Revolutionsâ€. 
Will Trump keep his promises on international matters? 
Will Australia take Keatingâ€™s advice and lead the West into a new era of how to deal and cooperate with the new USA if indeed a new USA is on the rise? 
Very pertinently, will Trump realize that he cannot unite people if he is going to adopt social policies based on segregation? This sounds like expecting him to keep certain election promises and denounce others; and expectation that he keeps the election promises on international affairs and revoking those on social justice issues, a big dose of wishful thinking, but will his stand on the social issues that are causing concern within and outside America take a back step? 
We can all hope, because as the world stands at the edge of the cliff of a nuclear confrontation between the superpowers, something that most Westerners seem to be totally oblivious to, a very precarious position that the Obama/Clinton legacy has put the world into, humanity needs miracles to be saved, and when we need miracles, all we have left is prayer and all the hope we can afford to have. 
As a die-hard leftie, I hope that the traditional left wakes up and takes the lead in adopting its own rebirth; a doctrinal renaissance that will see the world from a vantage point of working towards partnership and conflict resolution, because right now, the bi-partisan agreements between the two major parties of any Western Democracy, Australia included, is nothing short of being a disgraceful bi-partisanship of war.

21278,1999 Rape Case Swirls Around Nate Parker and His Film â€˜The Birth of a Nationâ€™ - The New York Times,Cara Buckley and Serge F. Kovaleski,"â€œThe Birth of a Nation,â€ a drama about the Nat Turner slave rebellion, upended the Sundance Film Festival, selling for a record $17. 5 million and instantly vaulting to   of next yearâ€™s Oscar race. Scheduled to be released Oct. 7, the film is now attracting unwanted attention because of renewed interest in a    case in which the filmâ€™s director, writer and star, Nate Parker, was accused  â€”   and later acquitted  â€”   of rape when he was a student at Penn State. His college roommate, Jean McGianni Celestin, who received a credit on the movie, was also charged. Last week Deadline. com and Variety asked Mr. Parker about the case, and on Tuesday, Variety reported that his accuser committed suicide in 2012 at age 30. In a statement to The New York Times, the womanâ€™s family said: â€œWe appreciate that after all this time, these men are being held accountable for their actions. However, we are dubious of the underlying motivations that bring this to present light after 17 years, and we will not take part in stoking its coals. While we cannot protect the victim from this media storm, we can do our best to protect her son. For that reason, we ask for privacy for our family and do not wish to comment further. â€ But the womanâ€™s sister, Sharon Loeffler, said that statement did not represent the sentiments of other family members or the woman herself. â€œI know what she wouldâ€™ve said,â€ Ms. Loeffler said, â€œand that would be, â€˜I fought long and hard, it overcame me. All I can ask is any other victims to come forward, and not let this kind of tolerance to go on anymore. â€™â€ Ms. Loeffler said her sister had believed there were other victims and had been broken by the 1999 case and its aftermath. â€œThese guys sucked the soul and life out of her. â€ Mr. Parker took to Facebook on Tuesday evening to say he had just learned of the death and was filled with sorrow. â€œI canâ€™t help but think of all the implications this has for her family. I cannot  â€”   nor do I want to ignore the pain she endured during and following our trial. â€ He maintained his innocence, but added that he wished he had been more empathetic at the time, writing: â€œThere are things more important than the law. There is morality,â€ and adding, â€œI look back on that time as a teenager and can say without hesitation that I should have used more wisdom. â€ Hereâ€™s a look at the case. WHAT WE KNOW Mr. Parker was accused in 1999 of raping a fellow student at Penn State. The victim, whose name is not public, said that Mr. Parker and his roommate, Mr. Celestin, raped her while she was intoxicated and unconscious, according to court documents, and that they later harassed, intimidated and stalked her after she pressed charges. Both men said that the sex was consensual. Mr. Parker, who, according to court transcripts, had had consensual oral sex with the woman previously, was acquitted of the charges. Mr. Celestin, who received a â€œstory byâ€ credit on â€œThe Birth of a Nation,â€ was convicted of sexual assault, but his case was appealed. There are conflicting accounts about the outcome. The woman, under the name Jane Doe, then sued Penn State for failing to protect her from harassment the case was settled for $17, 500. According to court records, the victim had twice attempted suicide after the alleged rape. According to a court document, as a result of the harassment, the accuser â€œsuffered severe depression, sleeplessness, and anxiety attacks. â€ She also said that her apartment had been broken into and that her files on the case had been â€œdisturbed. â€ On Tuesday, it emerged that the woman killed herself in 2012, overdosing on sleeping pills, according to Varietyâ€™s interview with her brother. WHAT MR. PARKER HAS SAID ABOUT THE CASE In an interview with The Times last weekend on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, Mass. where he was appearing with Spike Lee at a film festival, Mr. Parker said that he had never wanted to hide his past, and that he had made a conscious decision not to change his Wikipedia page, which included references to the 1999 case. â€œI talked about it publicly and I never sought to hide it,â€ he said. â€œIt was the most painful thing I have ever had to experience.

I get it,â€ he said. â€œThe reality is there is a problem on campuses in America, and violence against women is not taken seriously enough. And the dialogue and the discourse isnâ€™t loud enough. I think thereâ€™s even more that can be done to educate university students, men and women.

Weâ€™re discussing a case which was thoroughly litigated. I was cleared of everything. At some point I have to ask myself, â€˜How often am I willing to relive it? â€™â€ WHY THIS IS A STORY NOW Backed by Fox Searchlight, Mr. Parker has just embarked on an extensive campaign to promote the film, and media scrutiny is heightened. While the case was written about in 1999 in local newspapers and in a 2007 profile of Mr. Parker in The   it only garnered widespread attention after Deadline published details from the court transcripts. â€œThe Birth of a Nationâ€ tells the story of Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831. The film was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival this year, shortly after the   slate of Oscar acting nominees set off an outcry as well as a larger conversation about the lack of diversity in Hollywood. Almost everything about the film seemed a remedy to all that, including its name, a sharply pointed reappropriation (not a remake) of D. W. Griffithâ€™s landmark and racist 1915 film of the same title. Born into poverty, Mr. Parker, whose previous films include â€œThe Secret Life of Bees,â€ â€œRed Tailsâ€ and â€œBeyond the Lights,â€ had made telling Turnerâ€™s story a passion project, even turning down other work. He wanted Americans to face the legacy of slavery head on, and said the countryâ€™s aversion to doing so led to countless   problems, including tensions between the police and black Americans. Support for the film surged. Last weekend, at the film festival on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, Mr. Parker and his   Aja Naomi King, appeared on a panel with Mr. Lee, who urged audience members to pack the theaters when it opens. At Sundance in January, Mr. Parker received a standing ovation from a packed audience before the film began. Afterward, there was a bidding war, with Fox Searchlight emerging the victor and paying a festival record for the right to distribute the drama. This week Variety reported that in light of new attention around Mr. Parker over the rape case, Fox Searchlight would be changing its release plans and possibly refusing to grant more interviews with Mr. Parker for a few weeks, but a studio spokesman said Tuesday that those suggestions were untrue and that the release and marketing of the film would go ahead as planned."
21279,"Girl Asks Her 20 Boyfriends To Each Give Her an iPhone, Uses The Money To Buy a House",Eddy Lavine,"Many Women Suffer From Fungal Infections And They Can Cure Them At Home Îž [November 1, 2016] BLOG Girl Asks Her 20 Boyfriends To Each Give Her an iPhone, Uses The Money To Buy a House posted by Eddie We have heard the stories about Apple fanatics selling body parts and changing their passport in order to get the latest products from the company , but this latest story coming from China gives a different perspective on how you can use Apple devices as a tool. As a rather strange tool, in fact: an entrepreneurial Chinese woman is said to have convinced 20 men that she has been dating to buy her iPhones, which she would then sell and use the money as a downpayment for a house. The purchase of a house is probably the single biggest one-time spending in the lifetime of a person, and it could take long years of hard work, so it is indeed remarkable that the woman found the quick way to get there (however, not the most ethical one, arguably). Letâ€™s make it clear: the story seems to have started on local Tian Ya Yi Du forum, where someone by the nickname Proud Qiaoba told the story of how her co-worker Xiaoli (not her real name) asked each of her 20 current boyfriends to buy her the new iPhone 7. How in the world is it possible to simulatenously date 20 people remains a mystery that gives this whole story a bit of a fairy tale aura, but knowing that China suffers from a terrible male-to-female ratio letâ€™s assume that is somehow possible. Xiaoli, whose life remains veiled in secrecy, then sold all of the phones to a suspiciously particular place: mobile phone recycling site Hui Shou Bao, all for a total of 120,000 Chinese yuan, the equivalent of around $17,500. The woman then used the cash for a downpayment towards a countryhouse home. Xiaoli broke the news when she invited her co-workers for a house warming party. â€œEveryone in the office is talking about this now. Who knows what her boyfriends think now this news has become public.â€ From Qiaoba we also learn that Xiaoli â€œis not from a wealthy family. Her mum is a housewife and her dad is a migrant worker, and she is the oldest daughter. Her parents are getting old and she might be under a lot pressure hoping to buy them a houseâ€¦ But itâ€™s still unbelievable that she could use this method!â€ 
It does indeed sound quite fantastical and made-up, and some have theorized that itâ€™s all just a theory to popularize the local Hui Shou Bao phone re-seller (the company has confirmed that it had indeed sold 20 iPhones from a single person recently). Meanwhile, the whole story quickly started becoming popular in China: a â€™20 mobiles for a houseâ€™ hashtag went trending on local microblog Weibo and has been used more than 13 million times. Reaction sway from admiration for Xiaoliâ€™s boyfriend-getting and management skills to sheer awe and condemnation of her actions. Whatever it is, Xiaoli â€“ if she even exists â€“ is now said to shy away from the public eye and to refuse interviews from media. Thatâ€™s actually not surprisingâ€¦ those 20 boyfriends surely would not be happy about her actions. Source:"

â€œThis is ready-made advertising for Republican candidates to use nationwide,â€ stated Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. â€œIf youâ€™re a Republican candidate, it would be malpractice not to talk about it, highlight it or advertise on it.â€ 
To be sure, Trump has been hitting the issue hard over the past several days, mentioning the rate hikes at four separate rally appearances in a 24-hour period this week. 
â€œ Repealing Obamacare and stopping Hillaryâ€™s healthcare takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on Nov. 8,â€ Trump told rally-goers Tuesday afternoon in Sanford, Florida. Advertisement - story continues below 
Other Republicans have been quick to jump on the issue as well, including vulnerable incumbent GOP senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Roy Blunt of Missouri. 
Should these Republican senators and others maintain a focus on Obamacare during the final two weeks, they stand a good chance of fending off the Democrat effort to wrench control of the Senate away from the GOP. 
The same applies to Trump, should he refrain from media distractions and continue harping on the failures of Obama and his health care law, particularly in hard-hit swing states like Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, to name just a few. 
And he will have Obama to thank personally for paving the way to a Trump presidency through his horribly flawed Obamacare law. Advertisement - story continues below"
21281,"Ossoff Campaign Told Volunteers to Say â€™He Lives Three Blocks Away from the District,â€™ Reporter Shows Distance Is Three Miles",Michael Patrick Leahy,"It has been reported for several months that Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate seeking to win the special election in Georgiaâ€™s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday, does not live in the district. [Last month, an Ossoff campaign worker told volunteer canvassers that if asked about their candidateâ€™s residence, they should say that â€œhe lives three blocks from the district. â€  (Beginning at the 55 second mark in this YouTube video, the Ossoff campaign worker says, â€œThis falls into the category of if you donâ€™t know, you can say I donâ€™t know. But, yeah, I mean, he lives three blocks away from the district. â€) Brent Scher, an intrepid reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, put that Ossoff campaign claim to the test on Monday, and discovered that the actual distance from Ossoffâ€™s residence to the Sixth Congressional District is three miles rather than three blocks: I set out to walk from Ossoffâ€™s current residence in the northwest corner of Emory University to a section of the sixth district (outlined in green in the below screenshot) that juts down into the fifth district on Buford Highway. It would have been a shorter trip, by the way, to Georgiaâ€™s Fourth Congressional District, but thatâ€™s not where Ossoff is running. I drew myself my own little map, knowing that my phone would be taxed by my attempt to put the entire quest on Facebook Live, and set out at 10:32 a. m. for the International Cafe, which I determined to be the closest landmark inside the sixth district. I documented the early parts of my journey in the above video, but eventually the treacherous conditions of the long walk were too much for my Motorola Droid Turbo to handle. Shortly after my attempts to Facebook Live crashed and burned, my entire phone followed suit. Scher says he arrived at the International Cafe, â€œthe closest landmark inside the sixth district,â€ after walking for about two hours. He took an Uber back to where he had parked his car to begin his walk. â€œMy Uber from the International Cafe back to my car, which was parked by Ossoffâ€™s place, was 6. 55 miles and took 18 minutes and 45 seconds. My walk was about 3. 2 miles,â€ Scher wrote. â€œA lot longer than 3 blocks,â€ Scher concluded. The outcome of Tuesdayâ€™s election between Ossoff and Karen Handel, the Republican candidate, remains too close to call."
21282,Japanese troops deploy to South Sudan risking first overseas conflict since World War 2,Michael Krieger,"Japanese troops deploy to South Sudan risking first overseas conflict since World War 2 The move risks pulling the troops into conflict for the first time in more than seven decades By Michael Krieger - 11.21.2016 @1:18 PM EST 
The re-miliarization of Japan has been on my radar and caused me much concern in recent years. Iâ€™ve covered the topic on several occasions, with the most recent example published over the summer in the post, Japanese Government Shifts Further Toward Authoritarianism and Militarism . Here are the first few paragraphs: One of the most discomforting aspects of Neil Howe and William Straussâ€™ seminal work on generational cycles, The Fourth Turning (1997), is the fact that as far as American history is concerned, they all climax and end with massive wars. To be more specific, the first â€œfourth turningâ€ in American history culminated with the Revolutionary War (1775-1783), the second culminated with the Civil War (1861-1865), while the third ended with the bloodiest war in world history, World War II (1939-1945). The number of years between the end of the Revolutionary War and the start of the Civil War was 78 years, and the number of years between the end of the Civil War and the start of World War II was 74 years (76 years if you use Americaâ€™s entry into the war as your starting date). Therefore, if Howe & Straussâ€™ theory holds any water, and I think it does, weâ€™re due for a major conflict somewhere around 75 years from the end of World War II. That brings us to 2020. The more I look around, the more signs appear everywhere that the world is headed into another major conflict. From an unnecessary resurgence of a Cold War with Russia, to increased tensions in the South China Sea and complete chaos and destruction in the Middle East, the world is a gigantic tinderbox. All it will take to transform these already existing conflict zones into a major conflagration is another severe global economic downturn, something I fully expect to happen within the next 1-2 years. Frighteningly, this puts on a perfect collision course with the 2020 area. 
Although I felt World War 3 was a virtual lock under Hillary Clinton, the election of Trump does not negate historical cycles or current geopolitical trends, and the world continues to move in a very dangerous direction. 
While the below snippet from a Reuters article published today may not seem like a big deal, itâ€™s just a small part of a much larger trend. 
Via Reuters : A contingent of Japanese troops landed in South Sudan on Monday, an official said â€“ a mission that critics say could see them embroiled in their countryâ€™s first overseas fighting since World War Two. The soldiers will join U.N. peacekeepers and help build infrastructure in the landlocked and impoverished country torn apart by years of civil war. But, under new powers granted by their government last year, they will be allowed to respond to urgent calls for help from U.N. staff and aid workers. There are also plans to let them guard U.N. bases, which have been attacked during the fighting. The deployment of 350 soldiers is in line with Japanese security legislation to expand the militaryâ€™s role overseas. Critics in Japan have said the move risks pulling the troops into conflict for the first time in more than seven decades. 
All it would take is a sharp global economic downturn to push world â€œleadersâ€ towards overseas conflict in order to distract from problems at home. The risk is very real."
21283,Donald Trump Rescued From Stalled Elevator in Colorado Springs - The New York Times,The Associated Press,"COLORADO SPRINGS  â€”   The Colorado Springs Fire Department said that Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, had to be rescued from an elevator that was stuck between the first and second floors of a resort. In a statement released on Saturday, the department said that it was called at 1:30 p. m. on Friday to rescue about 10 people, including Mr. Trump, who were trapped inside the elevator at The Mining Exchange, a Wyndham Grand Hotel and Spa resort. The department said the firefighters opened the top elevator hatch and lowered a ladder into the elevator. Mr. Trump and the others used the ladder to climb out of the elevator to the second floor. The department said no injuries were reported. The Trump campaign confirmed that the incident occurred but did not provide details. During a rally on Friday at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Mr. Trump criticized the cityâ€™s fire marshal for limiting the number of people allowed to attend his speech at the building where the event was held. Fire Marshal Brett Lacey told the Colorado Springs Gazette that he had already agreed to allow a 10 percent increase in seating at the venue."
21284,Prosecutors Say Trump Tower Climber Wanted Publicity - The New York Times,Eli Rosenberg,"The man who scaled Trump Tower last week told investigators he did so for â€œthe publicity,â€ which he hoped would earn him a meeting with Donald J. Trump, Manhattan prosecutors said in court on Wednesday. Prosecutors said the man, Stephen Rogata, 19, made the statement after he was detained for the Aug. 10 stunt. It turned into an international spectacle, streamed over social media and broadcast by television news. Mr. Rogata appeared in Criminal Court through a video link to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he has been under psychiatric care since the episode. Wearing a pale blue hospital outfit, his brown hair covering most of his face, Mr. Rogata sat quietly as prosecutors read the charges, including reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing. Judge Kevin McGrath set bail at $10, 000 cash or $5, 000 bond. Prosecutors said Mr. Rogata, who lives in Virginia, walked into the Midtown towerâ€™s atrium, sneaked into a   area and began his climb of the buildingâ€™s exterior on the fifth floor. Mr. Rogata had been scaling the building for nearly three hours when he was grabbed by officers who had removed a window on the 21st floor. The climb, which was watched by millions of viewers on television and online, as well as hundreds of people from the streets below, was the latest   chapter for Trump Tower, since Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign there last summer. On Wednesday, Pierre Griffith, an assistant district attorney, said that Mr. Rogata told investigators he had wanted to give Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, â€œsecret informationâ€ that â€œhas to do with when heâ€™s president, how heâ€™s going to govern. â€ Prosecutors said Mr. Rogata told investigators that he had hoped to make it to the top of the   building but also knew he would quite likely be arrested. Mr. Rogata, prosecutors said, waited for his parents to leave home before driving to New York City, where he arrived on Aug. 9. He bought climbing equipment online in the weeks before the stunt and practiced on a   building in Virginia, Mr. Griffith said. Mr. Griffith asked the judge for a $20, 000 bail, saying several items fell out of Mr. Rogataâ€™s backpack as he climbed, including a laptop computer. â€œThis defendantâ€™s crime endangered not only himself and people beneath him,â€ but also emergency responders, he said. But Judge McGrath lowered the amount after being petitioned by Mr. Rogataâ€™s lawyer, Tara Collins of the Legal Aid Society. Ms. Collins said Mr. Rogata had been receiving psychiatric treatment at Bellevue. She described him as a good student  â€”   a member of the debate and the cross country teams in high school  â€”   who volunteered for Mitt Romneyâ€™s 2012 presidential campaign. He works at a plant nursery, she said. She described Mr. Rogataâ€™s father as a â€œ â€ officer in the Navy with a specialty in flight navigation, and said both of his parents had visited him at the hospital. Mr. Rogata, she said, â€œdid something that was profoundly stupid with hopes of meeting someone who he will never get to meet. â€"
21285,Boxing Judges and Refs Removed After Suspicious Results - The New York Times,Ken Belson,"RIO DE JANEIRO  â€”   Several referees and judges have been removed from the Olympic boxing competition after officials reviewed their decisions, fueling suspicion of dubious results in some matches at the Rio Games. A spokesman for the federation that governs the boxing tournament said Wednesday that the names of the referees and judges who were dismissed, and the matches that were tainted, would not be released because he did not want to â€œbesmirch their families. â€ The international federation, known as AIBA, said in a statement that the committee that reviews officiating had assessed all 239 bouts at the Rio Games through Tuesday and had â€œdetermined that less than a handful of the decisions were not at the level expected. â€ The federation statement also said that â€œthe concerned referees and judges will no longer officiate at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. â€ The move came a day after Michael Conlan, an Irish bantamweight, accused the federation of corruption and suggested that Russian boxing officials had bribed judges. Conlanâ€™s accusations came in an   tirade after he lost his quarterfinal to Vladimir Nikitin of Russia. Nikitin won a unanimous decision, but the public response to the verdict suggested that many observers believed Conlan should have won. The judgesâ€™ decision in the   fight was not the first at the Rio Games to draw scrutiny. On Monday, the crowd jeered when another Russian fighter, Evgeny Tishchenko, was awarded a unanimous decision over Vassiliy Levit of Kazakhstan, who appeared to have won the bout handily. Two of the three judges who scored Conlanâ€™s bout  â€”   Jones Kennedy Silva do Rosario of Brazil and Udeni Talik Bandara Kiridena of Sri Lanka  â€”   returned to officiate on Wednesday. All three judges had scored the fight   in favor of Nikitin. The judges of the   fight, the heavyweight gold medal match, were also unanimous in their decision. Only one of them, however, made a repeat appearance. Armando Carbonell Alvarado of Colombia judged two fights Wednesday, while Michael Gallagher of Ireland and Kheira Sidi Yakoub of Algeria judged none. The boxing federation did not say how many decisions it deemed insufficient, and it did not specify what was wrong with those decisions. None of the decisions will be overturned, AIBA said. Coaches at the boxing venue Wednesday said that the scoring system left a lot of room for interpretation and that the judges, although well trained, were not infallible. They also expressed relief that the issue of inadequate judging was being addressed, although they dismissed the accusations of corruption. â€œIâ€™m glad some action was taken,â€ said Billy Walsh, a coach of the United States team. â€œAnybody can make a mistake, but itâ€™s happened too often. â€ Kay Koroma, who also coaches the Americans, said, â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s corruption itâ€™s just bad decision making. â€ AIBA invited people with evidence about bribing judges to step forward. â€œWith regard to corruption, we would like to strongly restate that unless tangible proof is put forward, not rumors, we will continue to use any means, including legal or disciplinary actions, to protect our sportâ€ and the referees and judges â€œwhose integrity is constantly put into question,â€ the federationâ€™s statement said. The federation chooses from 36 judges and referees at the Rio Games. AIBA picks five judges to work each bout and prohibits judges from a fighterâ€™s country, or from a country in conflict with a fighterâ€™s country, from working a bout. After each fight, a computer program randomly determines which three of the five judgesâ€™ scorecards will be counted. The other two scorecards are thrown out. Still, questions about judging will continue. â€œIf they really prove that there was some kind of corruption, it is really very sad, but for now thereâ€™s no proof of anything, only rumors,â€ said Mateus Alves, a Brazilian coach."
21286,In Just 11 Days Scientists Destroyed Breast Cancer Tumors Without Chemo,Dikran Arakelian (noreply@blogger.com),"Share on Facebook Research presented by Professor Nigel Bundred at the European Breast Cancer Conference in Amsterdam revealed that they had tested the effectiveness of a pair of drugs known as Herceptin (a.k.a trastuzumab) and Lapatinib. The two drugs are commonly used in breast cancer treatment already, but this is the first time they had been combined together and used before surgery and chemotherapy. What they found was they were able to eliminate some types of breast cancer in just 11 days. Funded by Cancer Research UK, they aimed to use these drugs to combat a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) which affects the growth and division of cancer cells . It's also more likely to return than other cancer types. What also makes this treatment so appealing is the fact that it eliminates the need for chemotherapy and surgery. The temporary side effects like hair loss, vomiting and fatigue are also avoided, making treatment less impactful on the body. Chemo is not entirely effective, nor is it the right choice for a lot of patients, so any alternatives are welcomed. Study Results 257 women with HER2 positive breast cancer were selected for the study, with half being put on the drug combo and the other half were the control group. What they found was that of those on the drug, 11% had no cancer cells remaining within two weeks and 17% of cases featured dramatically shrunken tumors . Compared to the control group who were only given Herceptin, they were found to have 0% with no trace of cancer cells and only 3% showed a drop in tumor size. Clearly, the two drugs combined have a major effect on breast cancer cells as opposed to being used on their own. The problem currently, however, is that Herceptin's licensing makes it only available for use alongside chemotherapy and not alone. The results of this study may help to change that though. Although there's still a lot of work to be done, hopefully, this is a major step in the fight against one of the world's deadliest diseases. With medical advancements improving every year, it's entirely possible this could happen sooner than we think!"
21287,Marco Rubio Inches Closer To Unemployment As Poll Shows Florida Senate Race Tie,Jason Easley,"A PPP poll of Florida found: 
Candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in Florida. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by four points (48/44), and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy is tied with Republican incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, 46/46. By an almost two to-one margin, 51/26, Florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for U.S. Senate who supports strengthening gun laws, suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month. 
The poll was conducted by PPP the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and it illustrates the dilemma that the Florida Senate race has created for Democrats. Democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive Florida media, but there are polls that suggest that Sen. Marco Rubioâ€™s Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. 
If Rep. Murphy can beat Sen. Rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to Rubioâ€™s national political career or at least force the Florida Republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. 
Democrats have a real chance to send Marco Rubio to the unemployment line. Rubio has been a disinterested Senator, who just like Ted Cruz, seems only interest in his Senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions. Rubio has provided poor service to his constituents , and doesnâ€™t deserve to return to the US Senate. 
Sen. Rubio has refused to commit to serving his full Senate term, which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them. 
Democrats have a chance to solidify their potential Senate majority by sending Marco Rubio home. With cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign, theyâ€™d be foolish not to take it.

21289,New Orleans Police Officers Plead Guilty in Shooting of Civilians - The New York Times,Campbell Robertson,"NEW ORLEANS  â€”   A legal journey that was set off more than a decade ago with the shooting of unarmed citizens by police officers in the desperate days after Hurricane Katrina wound toward a close on Wednesday when five former officers pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy, obstruction of justice and civil rights charges. The plea agreements drew prison terms from three to 12 years. Those sentences were significantly shorter than those handed down when the men were convicted five years ago in verdicts that were later thrown out. But the agreements were supported by the families of the victims and brought some degree of conclusion to a nearly   endeavor that in ways presaged the current struggles over police and accountability in places like Baltimore, Cleveland and Ferguson, Mo. â€œToday is the first day of the rest of my life,â€ Sherrel Johnson, the mother of    James Brisette, one of the two people who were killed in the shootings, told reporters after the hearing. â€œSomeone confessed â€˜I did it. I did it.â€™ And that did my heart all the good in the world. â€ The officers  â€”   Sgt. Kenneth Bowen, Sgt. Robert Gisevius, Officer Anthony Villavaso and Officer Robert Faulcon, as well as a detective, Arthur Kaufman, who was assigned to investigate the shooting  â€”   were initially indicted on state charges in 2007. But from there the case would be undergo years of troubles and reversals, eventually becoming drawn into a scandal in the federal prosecutorsâ€™ office here that took down the local United States attorney. The Danziger case was one of several federal prosecutions of police officers for killings in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, with 18 current and former officers facing charges at one point. These cases did not find an easy path in the courts the prosecution of another   police shooting, that of Henry Glover, ended mostly in acquittals. But the cases did prompt the United States Justice Department to examine the cityâ€™s police force as a whole, and in 2012, the force was brought under a federally mandated consent decree, a   blueprint for an overhaul of the departmentâ€™s practices. That consent decree remains in place. â€œServing as an officer is one of the most complex and difficult jobs in our society,â€ Kenneth A. Polite Jr. the current United States attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, said at a news conference after the hearing. â€œAt the same time, when individuals ignore their oath of office, and instead violate the civil rights of the public they are sworn to serve, they will be held accountable. â€ The case began on Sept. 4, 2005, in a city still without order and drowning in floodwaters. Two groups of families and friends, all of them black, were crossing the Danziger bridge in search of food and relatives when police officers rushed to the scene in a Budget rental truck. The officers, responding to a distress call, opened fire with shotguns and   sending those on the bridge, all of whom were unarmed, diving and running for cover. Four people were severely injured  â€”   one woman lost part of her arm  â€”   and two were killed: James Brisette, and Ronald Madison, a    developmentally disabled man who took a shotgun blast in the back. The state indicted seven officers, but that indictment was dismissed for improprieties involving the grand jury. Six were then charged by federal prosecutors in 2010, and the next year five of them went to trial together. (The case of a retired sergeant, Gerard Dugue, was severed from the others. He is still waiting for a new trial after an earlier mistrial.) At the federal trial of the five officers, defense lawyers emphasized that the men were rushing to the bridge under the belief  â€”   mistaken, as it turned out  â€”   that a policeman had been shot, and that under the extreme circumstances of the time, they should not be harshly judged. But prosecution witnesses, including other officers at the scene who had pleaded guilty, said officers had fired without warning and immediately after the shootings began to construct what would become an elaborate  . All of the men were found guilty and faced sentences of six to 65 years. At their sentencing, however, Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt of Federal District Court delivered a lengthy speech condemning the prosecution for its plea deals and its use of problematic witnesses, and deploring the mandatory minimum sentences he was forced to impose. Two years later, he threw out the convictions, citing a scandal that had been unfolding in the local United States attorneyâ€™s office, involving senior prosecutors who had anonymously commented under online articles in the local media about cases on trial. Describing his own investigation into the scandal and his frustration with the Justice Departmentâ€™s internal investigation, Judge Engelhardt insisted that the Danziger case be retried. His disdain for the Justice Department at the 2011 trial that was still on stark display on Wednesday, when the judge said that the Danziger case â€œmight most be remembered by the  â€ of the prosecutors. A panel of appeals court judges upheld Judge Engelhardtâ€™s order for a new trial last year. In recent weeks, the lawyers from the Justice Department withdrew, which Judge Engelhardt deemed necessary for the case to move forward. Under the terms of Wednesdayâ€™s deal, the four officers involved in the shooting received sentences ranging from seven to 12 years, with credit for time served. The fifth man, Mr. Kaufman, who was accused in the   got three years. â€œThis has been a terrible ordeal for our family, our friends and our community,â€ said Lance Madison, who was arrested  â€”   under false pretenses  â€”   by officers on the bridge just minutes after one of them shot and killed his younger brother Ronald. â€œIâ€™m thankful that our mother is still with us and is able to see justice being served, and for these officers to finally be held accountable for their crimes. I hope and pray that no other family ever has to go through what we have gone through. â€"

But Italyâ€™s president, Sergio Mattarella, said in a statement that he had asked Mr. Renzi to delay stepping down until Parliament passes a budget for 2017. â–  Mr. Renzi had said he would resign after voters rejected changes to the Constitution that he supported in what amounted to a referendum on the prime ministerâ€™s government. â–  The decision to hold a referendum is another example of why political scientists say such votes are often â€œmessy and dangerous. â€ â–  The results represented another victory for   movements in Europe. â€œTimes have changed,â€ said Beppe Grillo, the leader of the populist Five Star Movement.

Before his meeting with the president, Mr. Renzi briefly conferred with his cabinet at the Chigi Palace, the prime ministerâ€™s residence in Rome, where the night before Mr. Renzi announced in an emotional news conference, â€œthe experience of my government ends here. â€ Once Mr. Renziâ€™s resignation eventually takes effect, Mr. Mattarella will work with Italian political leaders to discuss what comes next.  â€”   ELISABETTA POVOLEDO and JASON HOROWITZ Italy greeted the news of Mr. Renziâ€™s symbolic defeat with uncertainty on Monday. A headline in the daily La Repubblica declaring, â€œThe No Triumphs, Renzi Quits,â€ echoing the sentiment in most newspapers. Commentators acknowledged Mr. Renziâ€™s dignified reaction to what mostly seemed a vote against his tenure, and they called for responsibility from political forces. â€œNow the reality is the risk of a return to the swamps and to instability,â€ Mario Calabresi, editor in chief of La Repubblica, wrote in a   editorial on Monday. â€œA scenario that Italy really doesnâ€™t need. â€ Once Mr. Renziâ€™s resignation is official and he steps down, Mr. Mattarella would then hold talks with the political parties trying to form a caretaker government or call early elections. According to the Italian news media, one candidate who could lead a temporary government is Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, a technocrat. The speaker of the Senate, Pietro Grasso, a longtime   magistrate, is also a possibility. Although most opposition parties are pushing for quick elections, opponents of Mr. Renzi in his Democratic Party are more inclined to take their time.  â€”   GAIA PIANIGIANI Beppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement who campaigned against the proposed constitutional changes and against Mr. Renzi, declared on Monday that â€œtimes have changed. â€ How much so may depend on Mr. Grilloâ€™s ability to parlay his latest success into a full sweep of the political establishment he has thumbed his nose at for years. Mr. Grillo, a former comedian, said that Italians should waste no time pressing for a new electoral law and for the dismantling of the old order. â€œYou should vote as soon as possible,â€ he said in a blog post on Monday to rally his supporters against the usual jockeying by parties for power in a caretaker government. â€œThe parties will do anything to drag their feet,â€ he said. The Five Star Movement won a quarter of the vote in 2013 national elections. Mr. Grillo said then that cooperating with traditional parties in any sort of alliance would be akin to capitulation. â€œThe existing political class must be expelled immediately,â€ he said in an interview at that time with The New York Times.  â€”   JEFFREY MARCUS A breakdown of returns shows that opposition to the constitutional changes was widespread, though more pronounced in the south. Only three regions backed the changes: the historically leftist areas of Tuscany and   in central Italy, and   Adige in the far north. In the economically struggling Sicily and Sardinia, which voted against the changes, the divide between the camps was as large as 44 percentage points. The pattern was similar in areas with high unemployment and social problems. â€œThe country isnâ€™t growing, and voters blamed their personal condition on the government,â€ said Stefano Folli, a commentator for La Repubblica. The results also reflected a generational divide. According to a survey reported by the news channel Sky TG24, young voters rejected the proposed changes, while more than half of those over 55 supported them.  â€”   GAIA PIANIGIANI In analyzing the results, Italian pundits did not always agree, except on one point: the severe consequences for Mr. Renzi. â€œDoes Renzi represent the country from a political, cultural point of view? Yesterdayâ€™s vote is a clear rejection of Renziâ€™s economic policies and of how he envisioned the country,â€ the political commentator Mario Sechi said. Mr. Renzi â€œdoesnâ€™t represent the zeitgeist of the nation, which did not follow him,â€ he added. For Mr. Sechi, the Five Star Movement is the clear victor, even if the â€œnoâ€ campaign brought together divergent political forces. Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, said the outcome was less clear. Rejection of the constitutional changes was actually a reaction to Mr. Renziâ€™s â€œreformist program that in some way threatened a big part of the social political equilibrium,â€ he said. The nearly 60 percent of the population that voted against him is â€œhighly divided, with nothing in common, and no leader,â€ Mr. Fabbrini said. What joins them is a conservative,   outlook. â€œWithin that, you have the most extreme left and right. â€ The person to watch in the short term is Mr. Mattarella, the president. â€œThis is the first real test of the president of the Republic, who has kept mostly in the background,â€ said Antonio Polito, deputy director of the   daily Corriere della Sera.  â€”   ELISABETTA POVOLEDO The euro recovered from early losses, and European stocks edged up. It was a muted reaction, in part because a vote against the constitutional changes had been expected, giving investors time to adjust their portfolios. Also, political instability in Rome is not unusual. But analysts said Italy was not in the clear, and there is potential for market turmoil in the case of government paralysis and of delays to plans to fix Italyâ€™s ailing banks. The euro first fell as much as 1. 5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading after the vote, but recovered by the morning in Europe, and it even gained ground compared with last week. Major European stock markets were all slightly higher.  â€”   JACK EWING The vote results and Mr. Renziâ€™s decision to step down drew a jubilant response from other populist leaders in Europe. â€œItalians have disavowed the E. U. and Renzi,â€ Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front in France, wrote on Twitter. â€œWe need to listen to this thirst for nationsâ€™ freedom and for protection!â€ With polls predicting that Ms. Le Pen will reach the 2017 presidential election runoff, she has sought to build an   platform calling for a â€œFrexitâ€ and a â€œPeopleâ€™s Spring. â€ The vote in Britain to withdraw from the European Union, known as Brexit, and Donald J. Trumpâ€™s recent victory in the United States have put wind in her sails. The   Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who recently refused to attend his   trial, used Twitter to congratulate â€œItalia + Matteo Salvini,â€ a reference to the leader of the   Northern League.  â€”   BENOÃŽT MORENNE Writing in Italyâ€™s leading economic newspaper, Il Sole 24 Ore, the columnist Guido Gentili said that after the referendum, Italy needed to show through actions and legislation that it â€œis not impermeable to reform. â€ The image of Italy as a nation that â€œbobs more or less happily in stagnant water between the third largest public debt in the world and a banking system in a deep comaâ€ must be â€œvigorously contested,â€ he wrote. Vincenzo Boccia, the president of Italyâ€™s main business lobby, Confindustria, said the referendum results highlighted the need to tackle pressing economic issues like â€œdebt, deficit and   growth. â€ â€œGrowth is the only way to eliminate inequalities and poverty,â€ he said in a statement issued Monday morning. Italian companies have been making â€œcrucial effortsâ€ to compete in international markets, he added, and need the government to back them up.  â€”   ELISABETTA POVOLEDO The populist victory in Italy was hailed by many   leaders across Eastern Europe, where similar sentiments are on the rise, but their reaction was tempered by widespread concern that the results would accelerate the fraying of the European Union, upon which the region has come to depend. Poland, the largest economy in the region, seemed torn between praising a victory by populists who share its governing party views and worrying about vulnerability to Russia. â€œThis would be a major blow not just for the E. U. but for the eurozone,â€ Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in an interview with Polish state radio. â€œWhat will the future bring?â€ Tomas Sedlacek, chief macroeconomic strategist in Prague for the lender CSOB, tied the Italian defeat directly to Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory and predicted a dire future. â€œDemocracy, and the future of the euro in Europe, is truly walking on the edge of a knife,â€ he said. In Slovakia, where   sentiment is widespread, many residents say that embracing the currency led to higher prices for everyday goods. â€œWe can expect a referendum about leaving the eurozone,â€ predicted Richard Zulik, leader of Slovakiaâ€™s liberal Freedom and Solidarity party.  â€”   RICK LYMAN Finance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro expressed relief that the economic reaction to the Italian referendum was muted. Yet the vote could still roil the European Union: It threatens to embolden opponents of the single currency, which could destabilize the Italian economy and foment turmoil in the banking sector. Helping to stoke that concern is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italyâ€™s oldest lender, which faces questions about whether it has sufficient capital. Asked whether a planned capital increase for the bank would now be delayed, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the   Eurogroup of finance ministers, emphasized that Italy first needed to select a new leader. Even as Brussels scrambled to stave off negative financial consequences, ministers from fiscally hawkish countries like Germany and the Netherlands will not want to be seen by their own electorates as being overly permissive toward Italy.  â€”   JAMES KANTER"

Williams, Ph.D.","From actor Chris Evans (Captain America) to director Joss Whedon, the Marvel Comics franchise is committing harikari in the most unbecoming of ways: through unapologetic, partisan bashing of a democratically elected president they canâ€™t stand. [Evans has expressed deep contempt for what he considers to be in the ignorant masses of Americans that voted Donald Trump into the White House. These are, however, the very masses that make up the core viewership of Marvelâ€™s superhero movies.  â€œPeople were just so desperate to hear someone say that someone is to blame,â€ Evans said in a recent interview with Esquire magazine. â€œThey were just so happy to hear that someone was angry, hear someone say that Washington sucks. â€ â€œI feel rage,â€ he said. â€œI feel fury. Itâ€™s unbelievable. â€ â€œThey just want something new without actually understanding,â€ he continued. â€œI mean, guys like Steve Bannon  â€”   Steve Bannon!  â€”   this man has no place in politics. â€ Evansâ€™ trolling of Trump on Twitter seems more an obsession than a pastime, and the actor seems to blame the President for all of the countryâ€™s woes. They did not die because of you. They died because of a hateful, ignorant, pathetic, EMBOLDENED piece of trash. https:  .   â€”   Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) May 29, 2017,  Unacceptable.

In large part, the bizarre rants the Marvel folks carry out on Twitter and elsewhere are abortion driven. Spitting in the face of their conservative fan base that is overwhelmingly   Whedon and Evans, along with other Marvel stars such as Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) fawn over Planned Parenthood while painting abortion foes as backward and unenlightened. â€œAs most of you know, Planned Parenthood has been under attack for many years now for another service they thankfully offer, providing a safe place for legal abortions,â€ Johansson said during a Variety luncheon last year. â€œA womanâ€™s right to choose what to do with her body shouldnâ€™t just be a womanâ€™s rights issue.

Why actors and filmmakers feel an irresistible urge to allow partisan politics to get in the way of their craft is a mystery, but whatever their motives such unrestraint often has consequences.

21292,Eleven Madison Park Plans a Makeover and a Summer Pop-Up - The New York Times,Florence Fabricant,"The restaurantâ€™s ratings are as good as it gets: three stars from Michelin and four from The New York Times. But for all the success of Eleven Madison Park, its owners, Will Guidara and the chef Daniel Humm, are about to start a major overhaul. They plan to close the Manhattan restaurant on June 9 to renovate the kitchen and the dining room, and to ship the operation and staff to a more casual, temporary setting in the Hamptons. If all goes well, they expect to reopen in   with a new look and a revised menu with some new dishes. â€œItâ€™s time for a change,â€ Mr. Humm said. â€œWeâ€™ve been at the restaurant for 11 years, and itâ€™s been open for 20 years. Weâ€™re still using Danny Meyerâ€™s brasserie. â€ Mr. Humm was referring to the restaurantâ€™s original owner, who sold it to them in 2011. Back then, they considered closing and renovating but held back because they thought it was more important to establish their footing. So they made only small changes over time to their stately dining room, with its Art Deco geometry and soaring casement windows overlooking Madison Square Park. The kitchen is also nearly 20 years old its renovation will require closing the restaurant. Mr. Humm has already ordered a Molteni stove from France, a   of cookery with a comparable price tag. But he does not plan to outfit his kitchen with lots of   electronic gear. â€œWe cook in a pretty traditional way,â€ he said. The partners are entrusting the redesign, which has not been completed, to Brad Cloepfil, who has offices in New York and Portland, Ore. and whose only restaurant work has been in Portland. He designed the Museum of Arts and Design, at Columbus Circle, and the Contemporary Art Museum in St. Louis. Mr. Cloepfil knows Eleven Madison Park well and has been a regular customer. â€œIâ€™m thrilled to be doing this,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s a great, elemental, historic room that needs preserving and updating. â€ The partners want to open up the entrance, which is now partitioned from the dining room, and rearrange seating to give the whole room a more symmetrical, central focus. There will be rugs on the terrazzo floors and more color everywhere: grays, blues, greens and golds. â€œIâ€™m not making a design statement,â€ Mr. Cloepfil said. â€œIf people are startled, I will have failed. â€ The most significant change will be in the bar area, which will be enlarged somewhat and given a more distinct identity. The partners decided that during the renovation this summer, they would need to find a way to keep the staff working. â€œWe thought about what New Yorkers did in summer  â€”   they go to the Hamptons,â€ Mr. Guidara said. Once the restaurant closes, they will move into a big white farmhouse on Pantigo Road in East Hampton. For decades, it was the Spring Close restaurant in the past few years it has been Mobyâ€™s, for fish. Theyâ€™re calling their   EMP Summer House it will open in late June with an indoor restaurant, a dining room under a tent with picnic tables for   dinners like lobster boils, and another outdoor area. The equipment they will no longer need in Manhattan will outfit the kitchen. Reservations for indoor seating will be taken online starting on May 1. Only cards from American Express, Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidaraâ€™s partner in this project, will be accepted. In   before Eleven Madison Park closes, the partners will replace its current menu with an   $295 tasting menu recalling favorites over the years. Dishes will include sea urchin cappuccino, carrot tartare, foie gras with maple syrup, poached chicken with black truffles, and the   dessert called Milk and Honey. When the restaurant reopens, Mr. Humm plans to offer multicourse tasting menus that are similar to the present   format, perhaps with more choices. (The particular dishes have not been determined.) In recent years, the number of courses has gradually been reduced, and the number of choices increased. â€œWeâ€™ll be starting over in many ways,â€ Mr. Guidara said. â€œAnd weâ€™ll finally be making the restaurant truly our own. â€"
21293,North Dakotaâ€™s Public Bank Is Funding Police Repression at Standing Rock,nan,"North Dakotaâ€™s Public Bank Is Funding Police Repression at Standing Rock Posted on Nov 4, 2016 
By Matt Stannard / Cowboys on the Commons Matt Stannard 
The brutal repression of indigenous and allied protesters at Standing Rock has shocked the conscience of fair-minded Americans, particularly those advocating economic and ecological reform. Although the protesters had in some cases been encroaching on â€œcompany land,â€ they had done so peacefully, and their chief modes of political action have been prayer and nonviolent civil disobedience. The crackdowns of the last few weeks have seen attack dogs and rubber bullets causing bloody injuries to protesters, detention and malicious prosecutions, and other dehumanizing behavior from the cops and soldiers deployed there by North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple. 
For those of us in the public banking movement, used to holding up the Bank of North Dakota (the nationâ€™s only public bank) as an example of how promising public banks are, the recent news that Dalrymple and an emergency spending panel voted to add $4 million in additional credit onto a $10 million line from BND, to fund law enforcement expenses at Standing Rock, is troubling. It means BND is using its heralded public power over fractional reserve banking to pay for those rubber bullets and a host of logistical expenses involved in arresting and evicting protesters the federal government has refused to evict, citing free speech concerns. 
This financing is part of one of BNDâ€™s core functions: providing emergency loans. A more positive deployment of that function happened in 1997, when BND provided emergency loans for the Grand Forks flood, at a time when communities desperately needed loans before receiving slow-moving FEMA reimbursements. Unlike the need to abuse   the flood was a real public emergencyâ€“the flooding caused structure fires and destroyed dozens of buildings via fire or water. Property losses in Grand Forks topped $3.5 billion. There were 50,000 evacuees. BND provided over $70 million in funds for relief. 
The Bank of North Dakota was conceived a century ago in the molding of distinctly American, agrarian-socialist populism. North Dakota farmers were in trouble, getting cheated by the big banks and big grain companies headquartered in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Those entities knew they had farmers at their mercy, and so all the interest rates were double-digit, all the loan terms were unfavorable (and less favorable to those who relied on them the most), and as the grain companies operated every grain elevator along the railroad route; those companies offered farmers destructively low prices, often cheating on tonnage because the farmers had nowhere else to go. 
  
In 1915, led by a struggling farmer named A.C. Townley, a group of North Dakotans formed the Nonpartisan League to push back against those powerful grain and banking interests. The NPL ended up taking political power in the state, creating both the Bank of North Dakota and the North Dakota Mill and Elevator. Today, those two public utilities are the only institutions of their kind under any state government in the U.S. Theyâ€™ve long outlived the NPL, whose inexperienced political leaders were subject to constant attacks and red-baiting from big business interests, exacerbating NPL infighting and corruption, culminating in the recall of Governor Lynn Frazier, alongside whom the state legislature had created one of the most progressive state agendas in American history. 
Since then, for understandable reasons, BND has been militantly apolitical. BND President and CEO Eric Hardmeyer has explicitly repudiated arguments that the BND ought to be a model, despite his effective touting of its successes. The Bank exists to help the state and its businesses function well and to maintain liquidity and economic stability. BND created the infrastructure for North Dakotaâ€™s oil boom, and if the state were to commit to a truly proactive transition to renewable and clean energy (it has taken baby steps), the BND would make it happen financiallyâ€“with an efficiency that would put the rest of the country to shame. 
But in the present political reality, cops and soldiers are brutally cracking down on Standing Rock protesters, and BND is funding it, and that makes BND not truly apolitical, but a facilitator of injustice. Public banks are tools, not sources of virtue in themselves. In the hands of bad policymakers, they can prop up bad policies. 
So what do we do with this unfortunate knowledge, besides continuing to support the Standing Rock protesters, calling the governor regularly (if you do, please mention that using BND to finance repression is shameful), and pushing for a just and sustainable transition to clean energy (including economic support for energy sector workers and their families)? What do these unfortunate events teach us about our movement? 
First, the awful actions in North Dakota donâ€™t undermine the idea of public banking. If anything, theyâ€™re more evidence against private ownership and shareholding in both fossil fuels and the financial sector. In financing those rubber bullets and smoke bombs, BND is paying the security costs of private corporations, subsidizing the worst of big oil capitalism. But as my colleague, Ira Dember, pointed out to me yesterday, North Dakota is rich in wind and is building wind farms. That four million dollars could have been better lent to develop additional wind resources and technology, and to train workers to transition from oil fields to wind farms and more. That depends on a larger movement, which Iâ€™ll talk more about below. 
Second, the actions illustrate the folly of pushing for state and local control without accompanying universal human and environmental rights. Economic and environmental justice advocates have long promoted local autonomy as a bulwark against big corporations and their puppets in national and state government. But local governments (often pushed by state legislators and governors) can do violence to indigenous communities just as they have enforced segregation and lynchings in the South. Human rights and environmental protection must be encoded in national and international norms and these norms need to have a complimentary and non-oppressive relationship with local communities. That makes our coalition-building and policy-making tasks bigger and more challenging. It makes allies and communication more important, and demands clarity about various movementsâ€™ and organizationsâ€™ ethical frameworks. 
Third, you canâ€™t keep people you disagree with ideologically out of single-issue movements. Sometimes this can be frustrating: There are all sorts of people in the public banking movement, including a few supporters who arenâ€™t committed to ending fossil fuel consumption, and even weirder and more disturbing, a tiny handful of extremists who want to take down big private banks because they associate banking with Jews. Thankfully, those toxic forces donâ€™t show up in any significant numbers (and the Public Banking Institute has explicitly repudiated them). While the movement is primarily white and bourgeois, there are powerful non-white, non-bourgeois voices in it, and its alignment with the New Economy Coalition and other economic justice coalitions helps considerably. It matters who you do your activist business with. 
Finally, whatever your own organizationâ€™s commitment to justice, the policies and institution your movement creates, if it is lucky enough to create them, will only be as socially positive and ethically correct as the people working inside of them, and the communities overseeing them. Public banks can fund a post-carbon, sustainable energy transitionâ€“but only if people successfully demand a post-carbon, sustainable energy transition. Public banks can create safe and prosperous communities for all, but only if thatâ€™s what communities are already committed to. 
Public banking advocates, in particular, ought to emphasize the ways public control of state and municipal finance can fund new structures of work and production that neither exploit nor extract. That has always been the most powerful argument for public banks: that they can produce justice because as community-controlled entities, we can make them just.

21295,Orlando Police Defend Actions as Clock Ticked in Massacre - The New York Times,"Richard PÃ©rez-PeÃ±a, Frances Robles and Eric Lichtblau","Some details of the Orlando nightclub massacre are known to the minute: The first reports of gunfire came at 2:02 a. m. The gunman made a 911 call at 2:35 a. m. in which he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. By 5:15 a. m. as hostages fled to safety, he lay dead or mortally wounded in a scene of unimaginable carnage. Many questions persist about those three hours at the   Pulse nightclub, and about how law enforcement handled the crisis on June 12. Orlando police officials have been peppered with queries from the public, survivors and the news media about whether they should have confronted the gunman sooner and whether any of the victims were shot by the police. The cityâ€™s police chief, John Mina, and other officials have repeatedly defended the delay in storming a bathroom where the gunman had taken hostages, and have deflected questions about whose bullets did what damage. On Monday, Chief Mina answered in a way that left open the possibility that some of the 49 people killed and 53 wounded were, in fact, hit by police gunfire. â€œThatâ€™s part of the investigation, but hereâ€™s what I will tell you: Those killings are on the suspect,â€ he said. The chief spoke at a news conference with local and federal law enforcement officials outside the club to release a partial transcript of the gunmanâ€™s conversations with the police during the siege, and to fill a few gaps in the official account of what took place. But the news conference seemed intended just as much to reject criticism of the police. â€œI think there was this misconception that we didnâ€™t do anything for three hours, and thatâ€™s absolutely not true,â€ the chief said. He said the police had used the time to rescue patrons, get the lay of the building, put resources into place, determine where people were hiding and talk to the gunman. Federal law enforcement officials at Mondayâ€™s news conference offered vigorous praise of local agencies and their personnel. â€œThey should not be â€ said A. Lee Bentley III, the United States attorney for the Middle District of Florida. â€œLives were saved because of their heroic work. â€ The killer, Omar Mateen, spoke with the authorities four times for a total of 29 minutes while holding hostages in a bathroom where victims lay bleeding. The transcript released by the F. B. I. covered only the first, brief call and fragments of the last call the substance of his statements was made public last week but not the precise language. In the first call, to 911 at 2:35 a. m. which lasted less than a minute, Mr. Mateen, 29, took responsibility for the shootings â€œin the name of God the merciful,â€ and declared allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader, Abu Bakr  . He demanded that the United States halt its bombing in Syria and Iraq. He talked with a police negotiator at 2:48 for nine minutes, at 3:03 for 16 minutes and at 3:24 for three minutes. In the last call, he claimed  â€”   falsely, it turned out  â€”   to have explosives. â€œThere is some vehicle outside that has some bombs, just to let you know,â€ he said. â€œYou people are gonna get it, and Iâ€™m gonna ignite it if they try to do anything stupid. â€ He said he had a vest of the kind â€œused in France,â€ an apparent reference to explosive vests used by Islamic State attackers in Paris in November. â€œWhile the killer made these murderous statements, he did so in a chilling, calm and deliberate manner,â€ said Ronald Hopper, an assistant special agent in charge of the F. B. I. â€™s office in Tampa, Fla. The F. B. I. at first released a transcript redacted to avoid mentioning the Islamic State and Mr. Baghdadi by name, which officials described as an effort not to play into the groupâ€™s propaganda. That drew ridicule in the news media and from some Republicans, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who suggested the Obama administration was playing down the attackerâ€™s radical Islamist motivation. Hours later, the F. B. I. released what it said was an unedited transcript of the first 911 call, with the names. The material released does not include any mention of a hatred of gays, which the bureau has been investigating as a possible motive. Federal officials declined to release transcripts of all the calls, or of 911 calls made by people trapped inside Pulse, or audio recordings of any of them. The first calls about a shooting came at 2:02 a. m. according to a timeline released by the F. B. I. The timeline did not say whether Mr. Mateen exchanged gunfire with an   officer working security, as some officials have said. At 2:04, more officers arrived, and at 2:08, officers from multiple agencies entered the club, and they and Mr. Mateen opened fire. â€œThat engagement and that initial entry caused him to stop shooting, retreat, and barricade himself into a bathroom,â€ Chief Mina said. Officials did not say how many officers fired in that gun battle, or how many rounds. The Orange County medical examiner, Dr. Joshua D. Stephany, said in an interview that autopsies of victims had not made any determination about who fired the fatal shots. In an interview, the SWAT commander, Mark Canty, said he doubted any fatalities resulted from police bullets. Members of his team, he said, â€œare trained to kind of identify the targets. â€ But it is not clear whether any officers in that gunfight were from the SWAT team, and it is clear that some were not. The full team was not called to the scene until 2:18. From the time Mr. Mateen retreated to the bathroom, Chief Mina said, â€œThere was no shooting in that   period until the commencement of the   operation. â€ Survivors who were in that bathroom have said Mr. Mateen had sprayed it with gunfire, killing and injuring several people, but their accounts did not make clear whether that happened before or after the firefight with the police. Former hostages agreed that a long period without shooting followed, though some have said Mr. Mateen shot a few more people at the end of the siege, after officers began to storm the building. Officials here have insisted that the police followed protocol in not trying to force a showdown that could have claimed more lives. In fact, Mayor Buddy Dyer said the departmentâ€™s practices called for officers to retreat 1, 000 feet once there was a threat of explosives, but they did not. Chief Mina said that throughout the standoff, officers went into the club, putting themselves in danger to rescue people. Some survivors have told stories to that effect Angel Colon, tearfully told of being unable to walk after having been shot several times, and expressed gratitude to an officer who pulled him to safety. But others who escaped with their lives have not been so complimentary. Norman Casiano said that after hiding and then making his way toward the club entrance, â€œI poked my head out, and the police actually shot at me. â€ â€œI started crying and yelling, â€˜Iâ€™m a victim, Iâ€™m a victim, please, Iâ€™m hurt, Iâ€™m injured, Iâ€™ve been shot twice,â€™ â€ he said. Jeannette McCoy, 37, who escaped early on, was furious at the caution of the police, yelling at them to end the matter. â€œI wanted this guy dead,â€ she said, but â€œthey gave him so much time. â€ At 4:21 a. m. officers pulled an   out of a wall, creating an escape route for people hiding in one room of the club. Eight minutes later, according to the F. B. I. timeline, some people who been inside had told the police that the gunman had said he was going to put explosive vests on four hostages within 15 minutes. That prompted the decision to storm the club, officials have said. While the gunman and his hostages were in one bathroom, officials decided to breach the buildingâ€™s outer wall at another bathroom nearby, to free people trapped there, and make a path in. A team from the Orange County Sheriffâ€™s Office placed explosives on the wall. Those were detonated at 5:02 a. m. but did not break all the way through, so officers used an armored vehicle to punch through the wall. But officials have said their aim was off, and they had to try multiple times to find the right spot for a hole. At 5:14 a. m. there were gunshots, as officers traded fire with Mr. Mateen. At 5:15, word came across the radio: the suspect was down. The F. B. I. said it had collected more than 600 pieces of evidence and conducted more than 500 interviews. One of those interviewed, Mohammad Malik, said that Mr. Mateen, a longtime friend, told him two years ago that he had listened to recordings of Anwar   the radical   cleric who was killed in an American drone strike in Yemen. Mr. Malik told a reporter that he told the F. B. I. at the time, and the bureau investigated but did not bring charges. The F. B. I. has said it looked into Mr. Mateen in 2014. Investigators continue to believe that Mr. Mateen acted on his own, inspired by extremist groups but not directly in contact with them. They are still looking into what his wife knew, to determine whether she should face charges. Agent Hopper appealed for the publicâ€™s patience with a case so complex that agents were still combing the crime scene. â€œThis investigation is one week and one day old,â€ he said, â€œand it may last months, and even years. â€"
21296,"â€˜Iâ€™m Nobodyâ€™? Not a Chance, Emily Dickinson - The New York Times",Holland Cotter,"â€œIn the Trumpian sense of the term, sheâ€™s the ultimate â€˜nasty woman.â€™ An inspiration. Volcanic. When I start to write about her, I always feel,  . â€ The volcano referred to is Emily Dickinson, as described by the contemporary poet Susan Howe in the catalog for an exhibition, â€œIâ€™m Nobody! Who are you? The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson,â€ opening on Friday at the Morgan Library  Museum. The show is one of the largest gatherings ever of prime Dickinson relics, and it comes with an aura the size of a city block. It instantly turns the Morgan into a pilgrimage site, a literary Lourdes, a place to come in contact with one aspect of American culture that truly can claim greatness, which we sure can use in an   political moment. The show has a mission: To give   audiences a fresh take on Dickinson. Gone is the   Puritan nun, and that infantilized charmer, the Belle of Amherst. At the Morgan we get a different Dickinson, a person among people: a member of a household, a   a citizen. She was born in 1830 to rural gentry in Western Massachusetts, and one of the earliest items in the show gives an impression of modest Yankee privilege. Itâ€™s a portrait of Dickinson at around age 10 with her older brother, Austin, and young sister, Lavinia, done by a local artist, Otis Allen. Itâ€™s sort of a big deal to have it here: This is the first time it has left Houghton Library at Harvard since it arrived there in 1950. And the Morgan displays it well, against   wallpaper that replicates the original, only recently uncovered, in Emilyâ€™s Amherst bedroom. In a sweet coincidence, the roses on the paper echo the flower the    holds in her portrait. As the daughter of a    â€”   her father, Edward, was elected to the United States Congress in 1853  â€”   and a lifelong consumer of newspapers and periodicals, Dickinson had a good sense of what was happening in the world. She went to grammar school, and was a bookworm, but had friends and a poised, dry sense of humor, as some teasing early letters to her brother suggests. In 1847, she spent a year as a boarding student at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, her one stint in higher education. And from that time came what many devotees will consider the exhibitionâ€™s star attraction: the   daguerreotype of the    Dickinson with her pale skin and   eyes. Itâ€™s another rare visitant  â€”   it last left home at Amherst College in 1986  â€”   and itâ€™s almost a shock to see how small it is:   like a holy card or a talisman. Dickinson said that she liked Mount Holyoke, but I donâ€™t know. It had its stresses. Part of the curriculum was religious, with students expected to make a profession of faith before graduating. The school informally divided potential candidates into three categories: those who would readily comply those who would need some persuasion and â€œâ€ to whom they paid special attention. Dickinson, who had developed an allergy to orthodoxy, was a   and proud. Itâ€™s important, in presenting a revisionist view of her, especially a normalizing one, to note that from the start, resistance was her natural mode, and one that grew increasingly pronounced, and eventually acute. The end of her schooling signaled the start of a new phase of her life. She was again at home and beginning to work in a serious way on poetry, which required concentration and a degree of isolation: a commitment, the willingness, I guess you could say, to make a vow. I think it wasnâ€™t easy. The 1850s were a period of personal tumult. Her school friends had dispersed. Several had married. Among them was Susan Gilbert, with whom she had forged a tight emotional and intellectual bond, and whom she relied on as a first reader and editor of her poetry. In 1856, Gilbert  â€”   thereâ€™s a picture of her here  â€”   married Austin and lived with him in the house next door to the family homestead. By 1858, Dickinson had accumulated enough poems to begin collecting them in handwritten,   booklets known as fascicles. And from around this time comes what is thought to be another portrait, a daguerreotype that surfaced in 2012 and is on   public view at the Morgan. Itâ€™s a portrait of two seated women, the one on the left tentatively identified as Dickinson the other one as her friend, and possible romantic partner, Kate Scott Turner. In the show, itâ€™s placed side by side with the earlier, authenticated photograph. The Dickinsons in each, with their candid, unguarded gaze, share a clear, if inconclusive, resemblance. And her pose in the dual portrait is extremely moving. Far from being the timid, removed figure of myth, she looks directly at the camera and reaches, in a   to touch the back of her friend. Much of Dickinsonâ€™s poetry from this time has an experimental, incendiary flair images of combat and violence occur. Itâ€™s as if she were experiencing the Civil War before it happened. And when it did happen, her production soared. Oddly, in the midst of the conflict, war was rarely her active theme. But like Walt Whitman, who began working as the equivalent of a psychiatric nurse in a military hospital in Washington, Dickinson seems to have been caught up in the   atmosphere that gripped the nation, a mood probably not entirely different from the one found in a divided America now. Whitman was permanently shaped by the war and its waste. Whether Dickinson was, I donâ€™t know. But when it was over, her life changed. She began to withdraw. Communication was through writing: letters as intricately composed as puzzles, notes as brief as tweets, poems sent out like gifts. The primary relics from this time forward are her manuscripts of poems. Nearly 1, 800 survive 24 examples are in the show, organized by Mike Kelly, head of archives and special collections at Amherst College, and Carolyn Vega, assistant curator in the Morganâ€™s department of literary and historical manuscripts. The manuscripts come with questions of legibility. Dickinsonâ€™s penmanship grew eccentric over time, as did her compositional methods. Transcribing her work has become a complex science, particularly in the matter of rendering the alternative phrases and words she included in drafts. It was as if she were deliberately creating poems that demanded reader participation, poems that could be endlessly rewritten. And maybe as her conviction grew that she would always be her own best audience, she turned poems into art objects, sculptures and pictures: A draft of a poem that begins â€œThe way hope builds his houseâ€ is composed on a bit of paper  â€”   an envelope flap?  â€”   shaped like a house. In the showâ€™s catalog, aptly titled â€œThe Networked Recluse: The Connected World of Emily Dickinson,â€ the art historian Marta Werner analyzes the visual nature of the manuscripts. Yet what matters most in Dickinson is the element most easily passed over in an exhibition: words. And they warn us, whenever we focus on them, against trying to normalize Dickinson, against trying to make her acceptable and explicable. She was an outsider, and as such a disrupter. Was she a feminist? Not in the modern sense, though an idea of female power as a protean force was central to her thinking, as it was to the writers she loved: Emily BrontÃ«, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, George Eliot. Central, too, was her disdain for the false power of churches, fathers, governments, God, ego. Even her most   poems, like the one for which the show is named, slice away at that power: This little anthem to outsider solidarity, delivered with a   lift, is both cute and furious, a joke and a call to arms. Some of its references translate neatly into the present of ethical bogs, Pepe the Frog, a new   . Its paranoia is of the moment, too, for many with a grain of Otherness in their makeup. Dickinson did, as a woman who said no to a culture that wanted her to be a wife, a mother, a social creature on its terms, when she had other plans. And to pursue them she assumed the guise of a Nobody: invisible, independent,   ignoring the knock on the door. The fringe for her was a position of strength, not deprivation. This truth should not be lost in the rebranding campaigns periodically conducted on her behalf. Nor should it be forgotten that defending difference took a lifelong fight, one which she was willing and able  â€”   supremely able  â€”   to wage. Thatâ€™s a revolutionary talking. And her voice carries, subaudibly explosive, through this show."

21300,Russophobia: War Party Propaganda    : Information,Margaret Kimberley," Russophobia: War Party Propaganda
The worldÂ’s most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council, while Russia has been kicked out. The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media Â– and Hillary hasnÂ’t even been elected yet.
By Margaret Kimberley Â“All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.Â”
November 06, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" BAR "" - Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights.
The dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.
Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isnÂ’t clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary.
The unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media, led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post , are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim.
Russia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in Yemen, too, but they are American allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds.
The openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful.
The United States and its allies are the cause of SyriaÂ’s destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate AssadÂ’s fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldnÂ’t know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to.
The anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on RussiaÂ’s borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell.
There is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more Â“muscularÂ” foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars.
The United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show.

21301,"After Plagiarism Reports, Monica Crowley Wonâ€™t Take White House Job - The New York Times",Maggie Haberman,"Monica Crowley, who was selected just weeks ago to serve in a   post on   Donald J. Trumpâ€™s National Security Council, has decided against taking the position after allegations that she plagiarized key passages in a 2012 book. Ms. Crowley, whose name was briefly floated as a candidate for White House press secretary, has been dogged by accusations of plagiarism in recent weeks, beginning with the discovery by CNN that she copied several passages in a book she published with HarperCollins. A later report in Politico unearthed similar issues in her doctoral dissertation. â€œAfter much reflection, I have decided to remain in New York to pursue other opportunities and will not be taking a position in the incoming administration,â€ Ms. Crowley said in a statement to The Washington Times. â€œI greatly appreciate being asked to be part of   Trumpâ€™s team, and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal,â€ she said. She did not address the allegations of plagiarism. Ms. Crowley is the second official announced by the transition team to decide not to go to the White House, following Jason Miller, who was to be the communications director. One person close to the transition said that Ms. Crowleyâ€™s role would have involved overseeing certain speeches, something that would have been difficult after the plagiarism claims. HarperCollins has withdrawn the digital edition of Ms. Crowleyâ€™s book â€œWhat the (Bleep) Just Happened?â€ Published by Broadside Books, a conservative imprint at HarperCollins, it is a critical look at Barack Obamaâ€™s presidency.

21302,Obama Puts Syria at Armâ€™s Length as Carnage Drags On - The New York Times,Mark Landler,"WASHINGTON  â€”   When Secretary of State John Kerry took the floor at the United Nations on Wednesday to deliver a searing denunciation of the airstrike on an aid convoy headed for the Syrian city of Aleppo President Obama was crosstown, at his Manhattan hotel, preparing for a day of diplomacy that included Africa, Israel and Colombia  â€”   but, conspicuously, not Syria. It was typical of the armâ€™  approach the president has taken toward the Syria conflict on the world stage in recent weeks. At a summit meeting in China this month, he studiously avoided negotiating a   with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, leaving the diplomacy to Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart. At the United Nations, he scarcely mentioned Syria in a   farewell address to the General Assembly. Mr. Obamaâ€™s public distancing, White House officials insist, does not reflect a lack of concern. On the contrary, they say the president is desperate for Mr. Kerry to negotiate a viable agreement with Russia that would halt the relentless bombing of civilians in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria  â€”   if only because he does not see a viable Plan B to stop the carnage. But as Mr. Obamaâ€™s presidency enters its final months, the negotiations with Russia have become a threadbare exercise, leaving a president who has long avoided military entanglement with Syria backing a policy that he himself believes is destined to fail. This week, his frustration boiled over publicly. The situation in Syria â€œhaunts me constantly,â€ the president said in an interview with the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, published Thursday in Vanity Fair. In a mix of candor and defensiveness, Mr. Obama said he had   himself more on Syria than any other issue during his presidency. He repeated his rejection of critics who said he should have armed the moderate rebels much earlier in the conflict or carried through on his threat to take military action against the government of President Bashar   after he fired poison gas at civilians in 2013. But he conceded that there might have been a failure of imagination in his response to the conflict. â€œI do ask myself, â€˜Was there something that we hadnâ€™t thought of? â€™â€ the president told Ms. Goodwin. â€œâ€˜Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a Churchill could have seen, or an Eisenhower might have figured out? â€™â€ While Mr. Obama has supported Mr. Kerryâ€™s diplomacy  â€”   even over the objections of the Pentagon  â€”   he does not want to be drawn into it. When Mr. Kerry met with Russiaâ€™s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, at a Group of 20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, on Sept. 4, the two fell just short of a   agreement over what officials said were minor details. American officials suspected the Russians were stalling so the deal could be sealed in a meeting the following day between Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin. After 90 minutes, a   Mr. Obama emerged to say, â€œGiven the gaps of trust that exist, thatâ€™s a tough negotiation, and we havenâ€™t yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work. â€ He instructed Mr. Kerry to keep talking to Mr. Lavrov, and the two came to terms five days later in Geneva. Mr. Obama, his aides said, was determined not to give Mr. Putin a platform to declare Russia was working hand in hand with the United States in Syria, particularly since he did not believe the Russians would abide by the terms of the agreement. â€œThe president wasnâ€™t prepared to offer the Russians what they wanted most  â€”   a symbolic show of U. S. cooperation  â€”   until the Russians delivered on their end of the bargain,â€ said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. â€œThatâ€™s why the bargain is structured the way it is. And itâ€™s rooted in our skepticism that they would deliver. â€ â€œThe president doesnâ€™t want U. S. credibility to be sullied by Russiaâ€™s dishonesty and willingness to sacrifice principle in the name of convenience,â€ Mr. Earnest added. Mr. Obamaâ€™s skepticism appeared warranted when the aid convoy was hit by a warplane that American officials believe was Russian. White House officials reacted harshly. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said, â€œThe question is whether or not we just walk away from the table completely at this point, or whether or not we do some more diplomacy and consultation to determine whether or not there is some path forward. â€ Again, though, Mr. Obama left it to Mr. Kerry to reproach Mr. Lavrov at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. To the extent he mentioned Syria during the General Assembly, it was in   humanitarian terms. At a meeting with other world leaders on the refugee crisis, Mr. Obama read a letter by a    boy from Scarsdale, N. Y. who wrote to him to offer a home to Omran Daqneesh, the    Syrian boy from Aleppo who was photographed, dazed and bloodied, after being rescued from an airstrike. The White House recorded the boy reading the letter aloud, and the video went viral on social media. Mr. Obamaâ€™s struggles with Syria are most palpable when he tries to sum up his   legacy. In his speech to the General Assembly, for example, the president cited his diplomatic overtures to Cuba and Myanmar, as well as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, which he said exemplified the power of global collaboration. But when he referred to Syria, Mr. Obama spoke of constraints rather than possibilities. â€œIf we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,â€ he said, referring to Syriaâ€™s sectarian rifts. â€œI do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts. â€ Mr. Obama made no direct reference to the negotiations with the Russians, saying only, â€œIn a place like Syria, where thereâ€™s no ultimate military victory to be won, weâ€™re going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need. â€ Several former administration officials said they understood why Mr. Obama was keeping his distance from the issue. â€œFrankly, I doubt Obama engaging on the diplomatic side would help much,â€ said Robert S. Ford, a former American ambassador to Damascus who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. â€œLike Kerry, Obama wouldnâ€™t have much leverage with the   Putin unless Obama was also putting into play in the Syria war new elements of material  â€”   not verbal  â€”   pressure against the    alliance. â€ Dennis B. Ross, a former coordinator of Middle East policy at the National Security Council, said Mr. Obamaâ€™s dilemma went back to the earliest days of his response to the Syria conflict, when he viewed it as a sectarian quagmire similar to that in neighboring Iraq. As the war ground on and the opposition became more Islamist, Mr. Obamaâ€™s options narrowed. Now, Mr. Ross said, the president has little incentive to say anything. â€œHe knows that anything he says either requires him to do something if it is tough  â€”   and he wonâ€™t  â€”   or makes him look weak and ineffective on an issue that will plague his legacy,â€ he said."
21303,Hereâ€™s How Goldman Sachs Lays People Off | Financial Markets,beforeitsnews.com,"(Before It's News) 43 here, 109 there and pretty soon 443 employees are dismissed Bank has to file â€˜WARN noticesâ€™ with New York state agency The first â€œplant layoffâ€ notice came in February: 43 people would lose their jobs.
The second arrived six weeks later, increasing the cuts to 109 workers. Then a third, in April, for 146 more. And a fourth, in June: 98. Three more notices followed, including 20 dismissals announced last week.
The â€œplantâ€ in question â€” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Like all big companies in New York State, the firm is required to file a â€œWARN noticeâ€ with state authorities when it plans to shed large numbers of employees as part of a plant closing, or â€œmass layoffsâ€ involving 250 or more. Employers also must inform the state of smaller reductions under certain circumstances, and Goldman Sachs cited a â€œplant layoffâ€ in each case. Last weekâ€™s notice brings this yearâ€™s job-cut tally to 443.With the run of notices, seven since the start of the year, the bank has signaled its intention to dismiss hundreds of employees in New York without placing a single, headline-grabbing number on the overall reduction, already its largest since 2008. The companyâ€™s approach differs from competitors, including Morgan Stanley, who have shown a preference for larger, one-time cuts.
Big Number
â€œWhen thereâ€™s a big number, people right away get that something is happening at that firm â€” itâ€™s a negative,â€ said Jeanne Branthover, a partner at New York-based executive-search firm DHR International. â€œThis is more, â€˜Weâ€™re having layoffs and we donâ€™t want to explain it.â€™ Itâ€™s more under the radar screen.â€
The 20 people in the latest reduction were notified either this month or last, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing staffing decisions. The terminations will take place between Nov. 7 and Jan. 5, according to the notice posted on the state Labor Departmentâ€™s website. The workers arenâ€™t represented by a union.
Gena Palumbo, a managing director and the bankâ€™s global head of employment law, is the sole Goldman Sachs contact listed on each of this yearâ€™s WARN notices. In 2008, the firm dismissed 900 people in New York in two different sets of cuts as the financial crisis raged. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs set aside $9.2 billion for compensation and benefits this year through September, 13 percent less than the first nine months of last year. Total employees, including consultants and part-time workers, fell 5.4 percent to 34,900.
While Goldman prefers a scalpel, its rival Morgan Stanley wielded an ax. That firm took steps to shrink in the fourth quarter, cutting 1,200 employees, including about 25 percent of the fixed-income trading staff, or about 470 traders and salesmen. When asked about how Morgan Stanley decided to make the changes, trading chief Ted Pick said he favored a bold move.
â€œWe took the view of taking tough medicine,â€ Pick, 47, said in February.
Slower Approach
Goldman Sachsâ€™s slower approach may reflect a desire to avoid cutting too much if trading or dealmaking comes roaring back. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has spoken about staying nimble to respond to revenue opportunities when they arise.
It also may reflect an outlook that got cloudier as the year progressed. In January, a person familiar with the firmâ€™s thinking said Goldman Sachs was mulling cuts to more than 5 percent of its fixed-income staff. By March, that would expand to more than 5 percent but less than 10 percent. And by May, 10 percent.
The job cuts continued after first-quarter revenue was the worst for the start of a year in Blankfeinâ€™s decade-long tenure. While trading business bounced back in the second and third quarters, total trading revenue for the first nine months declined 11 percent from last year.
The WARN notices donâ€™t capture firings outside New York and they donâ€™t include voluntary retirements. More than a half-dozen partners have left Goldman Sachs this year, according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg.
â€œEverything Goldman does is scrutinized,â€ Branthover said. â€œThis may be a signal or a sign that there are changes being made internally, or there are businesses and areas that are not performing satisfactorily. I would keep an eye on it.â€"
21304,War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital,Henry Wolff,"War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital Nick Gutteridge, Express, November 2, 2016 
A migrant turf war erupted into violence on the streets of one of Parisâ€™ trendiest neighbourhoods early this morning as asylum seekers beat each other to a pulp with wooden clubs. 
The area around Stalingrad Metro station was turned into a refugee battleground as rival gangs of migrants set upon each other in shocking scenes of violence. 
Asylum seekers wearing hooded tops wielded makeshift clubs fashioned from lengths of wood which they used to bludgeon each other as horrified pedestrians looked on. 
The blood-curdling brawl erupted just yards from the Stalingrad Metro station, where a squalid migrant camp has popped up following the demolition of the Jungle. 
It was not immediately clear what sparked the early morning fight, but rival gangs of people smugglers have previously been involved in violent brawls in Calais. 
And despite the horrific brawl, a pro-migrant rally is apparently being organised to take place at the camp at 6pm tonight. 
The once peaceful neighbourhood, in Parisâ€™ 10th Arrondissement, used to be a popular area with tourists, boasting a lively nightlife scene bustling with restaurants and bars. 
But worried residents have revealed how it has become a no go zone in recent weeks following the establishment of the refugee camp, which has brought squalor and violence. 
Thousands of migrantsâ€“mostly from Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan, and Eritreaâ€“have pitched tents under the Metro station after the demolition of the Jungle hampered their attempts to reach Britain. 
French police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat, but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it. 
There are now nore than 2,500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp, with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a â€œliving hellâ€. 
Residents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, with increased reports of muggings. 
Faisal, a shopkeeper, told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear, threatening the future of his business. 
He said: â€œThe stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live. The place is dead â€“ no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. 
â€œIâ€™m making less than â‚¬60 (Â£53) a day. A few more weeks like this and Iâ€™ll go bust! 
â€œFrench people have been kind to them. I know theyâ€™re desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.â€ 
Jeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. 
She said: â€œBrazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-byâ€“theyâ€™re even stealing bread. Iâ€™ve seen them beat people up too.â€ 
Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president FranÃ§ois Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. 
But within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. 
Furious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard â€œblood-curdling noisesâ€ coming from it in the middle of the night. 
Marie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: â€œLife here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, theyâ€™re back. And now that the â€˜Jungleâ€™ camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.â€ 
Another local, Monique, said that she was at â€œa loss for wordsâ€ and â€œutterly distraughtâ€ over the situation. 
She said: â€œThe streets are littered with rubbish and faeces. We can hear blood-curdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night."

21307,Turning the Tide Against Cholera - The New York Times,Donald G. McNeil Jr.,"SUNDARBANS NATIONAL PARK, Bangladesh Two hundred years ago, the first cholera pandemic emerged from these   mangrove swamps. It began in 1817, after the British East India Company sent thousands of workers deep into the remote Sundarbans, part of the Ganges River Delta, to log the jungles and plant rice. These brackish waters are the cradle of Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out. Water loss turns victims ashen their eyes sink into their sockets, and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries. Robbed of electrolytes, their hearts lose their beat. Victims die of shock and organ failure, sometimes in as little as six hours after the first abdominal rumblings. Cholera probably had festered here for eons. Since that first escape, it has circled the world in seven pandemic cycles that have killed tens of millions. Artists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet. It stalked revelers at a masked ball in Heinrich Heineâ€™s â€œCholera in Parisâ€ and kills the protagonist in Thomas Mannâ€™s â€œDeath in Venice. â€ Outbreaks forced London, New York and other cities to create vast public water systems, transforming civic life. Today cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like Ethiopia or Haiti. But it is a continuing threat in nearly 70 countries, where more than one billion people are at risk. Now, thanks largely to efforts that began in choleraâ€™s birthplace, a way to finally conquer the   plague is in sight. A treatment protocol so effective that it saves 99. 9 percent of all victims was pioneered here. The World Health Organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades. Just as important, after 35 years of work, researchers in Bangladesh and elsewhere have developed an effective cholera vaccine. It has been accepted by the W. H. O. and stockpiled for epidemics like the one that struck Haiti in 2010. Soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold. Merely creating that stockpile  â€”   even of a few million doses  â€”   profoundly improved the way the world fought cholera, Dr. Margaret Chan, secretary general of the W. H. O. said last year. Ready access to the vaccine has made countries less tempted to cover up outbreaks to protect tourism, she said. That has sped up emergency responses and attracted more vaccine makers, lowering costs. â€œMore cholera vaccines have been deployed over the last two years than in the previous 15 years combined,â€ Dr. Chan said. The treatment advances relied heavily on research and testing done at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, known as the ICDDR, B, in Dhaka. Although Dhaka may not be the first place one might look to find a public health revolution, the center is famous among experts in gut diseases. While its upper levels are quiet and scholarly, the centerâ€™s ground floor is the worldâ€™s largest diarrhea hospital. Its vast wards treat 220, 000 patients a year, almost all of whom recover within 36 hours. Doctors there save hundreds of lives a day. The ICDDR, B was originally the Cholera Research Laboratory, founded in 1960 by the United States as part of that eraâ€™s â€œsoft diplomacy. â€ Research hospitals were built in friendly countries both to save lives locally and to act as sentinels for diseases that might threaten America. The wards, which in the rainy season extend into   tents in the parking lot, contain long rows of â€œcholera cots. â€ On each iron or wood frame is a plastic sheet with a hole in the middle. A bucket beneath the hole catches diarrhea, while another beside the cot fills with vomit. An IV pole completes the setup. Defying expectations, the ward smells only of the antiseptic that the floors are constantly mopped with. Patients with severe watery diarrhea arrive around the clock, many of them carried in  â€”   limp, dehydrated and barely conscious  â€”   by friends or family. A nurse sees each one immediately, and those close to death get an IV line inserted within 30 seconds. It contains a blend of glucose, electrolytes and water. Cholera spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves, but it does not actually damage the gut cells. If the fluid is replaced and the bacteria flushed out or killed by antibiotics, the patient is usually fine. Within hours, patients start to revive. As soon as they can swallow, they get an antibiotic and start drinking a rehydration solution. Most walk out within a day. The techniques perfected here are so effective that the ICDDR, B has sent training teams to 17 cholera outbreaks in the past decade. Usually, the only patients who stay long in the hospital are infants so malnourished that another bout of diarrhea would kill them. They live for up to a month in a separate ward with their mothers, who are taught how to cook nutritious porridges from the cheapest lentils, squash, onions, greens and oil. Only about 20 percent of the patients at the center have cholera. The rest usually have rotavirus, salmonella or E. coli. The same therapy saves them all, but the cholera cases are more urgent because these patients plummet so precipitously toward death. â€œI thought I was dying,â€ Mohammed Mubarak, a gaunt    printing press worker, said one afternoon from his cot. His roommates had carried him in at 7 that morning, unconscious and with no detectable pulse. Now, after six liters of intravenous solution, he was still weak but able to sit up and drink the rehydration solution and eat bits of bread and banana. â€œHis stool is changing from   to green, so he is recovering,â€ said Momtaz Begum, the ward nurse who monitors the buckets and makes sure patients take in as much liquid as they lose. Mr. Mubarak had first fallen ill at about 2 a. m. a few hours after he drank tap water with his dinner. â€œUsually I drink safe water, filtered water,â€ he explained. â€œBut I drank the city water last night. I think that is what did this. â€ Cholera, born in the swamps, arrived long ago in Dhaka. The city is home to more that 15 million, and a third of the population lives in slums. In some places, water pipes made of rubbery plastic are pierced by illegal connections that suck in sewage from the gutters they traverse and carry pathogens down the line to new victims, like Mr. Mubarak. Vibrio cholerae travels from person to person via fecal matter. In 1854, the epidemiologist John Snow famously traced cases to a single well dug near a cesspit in which a mother had washed the diaper of a baby who died of cholera and nd convinced officials to remove the wellâ€™s pump handle. Because cholera is a constant threat to hundreds of millions of people lacking safe drinking water in China, India, Nigeria and many other countries, scientists have long sought a more powerful weapon: a cheap, effective vaccine. Now they have one. Injected cholera vaccines were first invented in the 1800s and were long required for entry into some countries. But many scientists suspected they did not work, and in the 1970s studies overseen by the ICDDR, B confirmed that. In the 1980s, a Swedish scientist, Dr. Jan Holmgren, invented an oral vaccine that worked an impressive 85 percent of the time. But it was expensive to make and had to be drunk with a large glass of buffer solution to protect it from stomach acid. Transporting tanks of buffer was impractical. Making matters worse, it was fizzy, and poor Bangladeshi children who had never tasted soft drinks would spit it out as soon as it tickled their noses. In 1986, a Vietnamese scientist, Dr. Dang Duc Trach, asked for the formula, believing he could make a bufferless version. Dr. Holmgren and Dr. John D. Clemens, an American vaccine expert who at the time was a research scientist for the ICDDR, B, obliged. â€œThis isnâ€™t an elegant vaccine  â€”   itâ€™s just a bunch of killed cells, technology thatâ€™s been around since Louis Pasteur,â€ said Dr. Clemens, who is now the ICDDR, Bâ€™s executive director. He and Dr. Holmgren lost touch with Dr. Dang, largely because of Vietnamâ€™s isolation in those days. But seven years later, Dr. Dang notified them that he had made a new version of the vaccine. He had tested it on 70, 000 residents of Hue, in central Vietnam, and had found it to be 60 percent effective. Although his was not as effective as Dr. Holmgrenâ€™s, it cost only 25 cents a dose. If enough people in an area can be made immune through vaccination, outbreaks often stop spontaneously. In 1997, Vietnam became the first  â€”   and thus far, only  â€”   country to provide cholera vaccine to its citizens routinely, not just in emergencies. Cases dropped sharply, according to a 2014 study, and in 2003 cholera vanished from Hue, where the campaign focused most heavily. But Dr. Dang had not conducted a classic clinical trial, and Vietnamâ€™s vaccine factory did not meet W. H. O. standards, so no United Nations agency was allowed to buy his vaccine. Because no pharmaceutical company had an incentive to pay for trials or factories, his invention languished in â€œthe valley of deathâ€  â€”   the expensive gap between a product that works in a lab and a   version safe for millions. In 1999, Dr. Clemens approached what is now the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, which was just getting organized. â€œThey were literally operating out of a basement then,â€ he said. â€œI got a letter from Bill Gates Sr. It was very relaxed, sort of, â€˜Hereâ€™s $40 million. Would you mind sending me a report once in a while?â€™ â€œBut without that,â€ Dr. Clemens continued, â€œthis wouldnâ€™t have seen the light of day. â€ With that money, Dr. Clemens reformulated Dr. Dangâ€™s vaccine, conducted a successful clinical trial in Calcutta and found an Indian company, Shantha Biotechnics, that could make it to W. H. O. standards. Rolled out in 2009 under the name Shanchol, it came in a vial about the size of a chess rook, needed no buffer and cost less than $2 a dose. Even so, there was little interest, even from the W. H. O. The vaccine lacked the publicity campaign that pharmaceutical companies throw behind commercial products, and â€œcholera ward careâ€ was saving many lives  â€”   when it could be organized. The new vaccine was not used in a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009, or initially in Haitiâ€™s explosive outbreak in 2010. The â€œvalley of deathâ€ lengthened: Without customers, Shantha could not afford to build a bigger factory. The impasse was broken only when Dr. Paul Farmer, a founder of Partners in Health, which has worked in central Haiti since 1987, began publicly berating the W. H. O. for not moving faster. The agency approved Shanchol in 2011, and since then, the vaccine has slowly gained acceptance. In 2013, an emergency stockpile was started, and the GAVI Alliance committed $115 million to raise it to six million doses. The vaccine is now used in Haiti, and has been deployed in outbreaks in Iraq, South Sudan and elsewhere. A second version, Euvichol, from South Korea, was approved in 2015. And later this year, Bangladesh  â€”   where it all began  â€”   hopes to begin wiping out its persistent cholera. A local company has begun making a domestic version of the vaccine, called Vaxchol. Dr. Firdausi Qadri, a leading ICDDR, B researcher, estimated last year that success there would require almost 200 million doses. The world finally has a vaccine that, with routine administration, could end one of historyâ€™s great scourges. But what will happen is still hazy. With 1. 4 billion people at risk, the potential cost of vaccination in   countries is enormous. And the disease tends to move, surging and vanishing among the many causes of diarrhea. Even Bill Gates, who paid for much of the research, has asked: â€œWe actually have a cholera vaccine, but where should it be used?â€ Looking back on his long struggle to prove the vaccineâ€™s value, and then to win acceptance, Dr. Clemens offered an explanation that blended wistfulness and cynicism. â€œWeâ€™re probably not bad scientists,â€ he said, â€œbut we were lousy advocates. â€œIf this disease had been in American kids, there would have been trials as fast as the Salk polio vaccine. â€"
21308,Donald Trumpâ€™s Executive Order: Officials Must Identify Immigration Applicants Who Support â€™Acts of Violenceâ€™ - Breitbart,Neil Munro,"President Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration Executive Order directs federal officials to set new immigration rules that will identify and exclude people who support the use of violence, and also hints at the exclusion of people who embrace orthodox Islamâ€™s â€œviolent extremism. â€[Senior officials â€œshall implement a program, as part of the process for [immigration] adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry,â€ said Section 5 of the new Executive Order, which likely will reverse President Barack Obamaâ€™s   policies to foreign migrants.   The   language in the new March 6 Executive Order is narrower and more legalistic than the   language in the   Jan. 27 Executive Order, which said: In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including â€œhonorâ€ killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Allied   and Islamic advocates, including Democratic activist Khizr Khan, complained that Trumpâ€™s â€œhostile attitudesâ€ language was intended to exclude immigrants with Islamic beliefs. The language bolsters the   language in the current   citizenship application document, which asks applicants if they have â€œEVER advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence? Have you EVER persecuted (either directly or indirectly) any person because of race, religion, national origin, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion?â€ The new memo also directs officials to collect and share information about immigrants and refugees who commit crimes, including the terror and   crimes associated with people from   countries.  Section 11 of the new order declares officials should collect information about: (i)    information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with   offenses while in the United States convicted of   offenses while in the United States or removed from the United States based on   activity, affiliation with or provision of material support to a   organization, or any other    reasons, (ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and who have engaged in   acts, or who have provided material support to   organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, (iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of   violence against women, including   â€œhonor killings,â€ in the United States by foreign nationals.  (iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses. The new Executive Order says it does not â€œdiscriminateâ€ against any particular religion, which is likely meant to rebut progressive claims that opposition to Islamâ€™s combined religious and political ideology is similar to legal curbs on the practice of Christianity and other religions which do accept the separation of church from state. Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion.  While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion.  That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities  â€”   whoever they are and wherever they reside  â€”   to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances. The Executive order directs agency heads to quickly establish the new entry rules, saying: The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order. The president also directs the agencies to toughen routine screening of legal visitors, such as tourists or business executives. â€œIn the first 20 days, [the Department of Homeland Security] will perform a global,    review of the identity and security information that each country provides to the U. S. Government to support U. S. visa and other immigration benefit determinations. Countries will then have 50 days to comply with requests from the U. S. Government to update or improve the quality of the information they provide. â€  Trumpâ€™s immigration and visitor rules will likely be very different from former President Obamaâ€™s   policies. Obama described his globalist policy in a Nov. 2014 speech to Democratic supporters in Chicago: Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, â€˜Well, I donâ€™t want those folksâ€™  â€”   even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. Obama made the same   claim in September 2015: When I hear folks talking as if somehow these [foreign] kids are different than my kids or less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow that they are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, I think thatâ€™s  . I donâ€™t believe that, I think it is wrong and I think we should do better, because thatâ€™s how America was made. Obamaâ€™s outside policy is expressed more crudely by the alliance of Islamic and   groups which are protesting Trumpâ€™s   immigration policies. #SFO: â€No borders, no nations, fuck deportationsâ€ pic. twitter.   â€”   Dieter Bohn (@backlon) January 29, 2017,          On"

[The 18 to    age bracket is usually notably liberal and broadly opposed to all expressions of nationalism, including Brexit and the election of U. S. President Donald J. Trump.  Yet in France, some 24 per cent of this group told pollsters they intended to vote for the populist candidate and her Front National party in the first round of the presidential vote on the 24th of August. The young, photogenic centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, who served as economy minister under outgoing president FranÃ§ois Hollande, also gained 24 per cent of their support in the Harris Interactive survey for French radio station RTL. Another 19 per cent of those interviewed wanted the   candidate   MÃ©lenchon to win the presidency and 14 per cent said they were rooting for   BenoÃ®t Hamon of the Socialist party.

SWIRLING rumours in one Waterford homestead suggest that Tramore woman and local aunt Deirdre Collaneâ€™s latest boyfriend may be â€˜the oneâ€™. 
In a dramatic unveiling ceremony, Deirdre is believed to have presented Danny Mondran to her older sister, her brother-in-law and her 4 nieces and nephews and declared they were getting on so well she wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they were married sometime next year in Spain, in a church she definitely hadnâ€™t already picked out. 
Not wanting to speak too soon or â€˜jinx itâ€™, Deirdre tentatively suggested Mondran, her 14th boyfriend of the 2016 dating season, was likely to be the one, her future husband and mother of her 5 children named Daniel Jr, Ciara, Colm, Eoin and Ella. 
â€œMore like future ex-husband,â€ Deirdreâ€™s brother-in-law Martin whispered under his breath, not helping matters at all. 
Citing two dates they had gone reasonably well and a half remembered and drunken conversation about â€˜wanting kidsâ€™ the 36-year-old school teacher was happy to report she had â€˜called off the searchâ€™, much to the confusion of Daniel, who could have sworn Deirdre said they were going to the cinema and not to her sisterâ€™s house for a sit down meal. 
â€œI thought Graham was your boyfriend,â€ said one of Deirdreâ€™s nieces, veering wildly off a carefully worded script provided to her by her mother, Elaine, as part of an effort to ensure one of Deirdreâ€™s triggers werenâ€™t activated.

Donald Trump held a rally Wednesday night in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, and as he spoke, one of his supporters held up a Hillary Clinton doll with a noose around its neck. 
The woman who hung the Democratic nominee in effigy said her name was Ginger Glover. Glover said she decided to hang the â€œLyinâ€™ Hillaryâ€ doll to show that Clinton should be â€œincarcerated, at the very least.â€ 
So does Glover wish harm on the former Secretary of State? She insisted she didnâ€™t: â€œItâ€™s just for effect.â€ 
One is left wondering why, if Glover thinks Clinton should be imprisoned, she didnâ€™t dress the doll in an orange jumpsuit or prison stripes. Perhaps sheâ€™s simply not bright enough to have thought of doing so. 
In recent weeks, various disturbing and violent displays have shown up at Trump rallies: Earlier this week at a rally in Virginia Beach, Trump supporters took a model of Clintonâ€™s head and mounted it on a stake. 
Also, at that same rally, reporters saw a poster which depicted a bullâ€™s-eye superimposed over Clintonâ€™s face. 
It should also be noted that a frequent chant heard at Trump rallies is the oft-repeated â€œLock her upâ€ refrain which was a feature of the GOP convention in Cleveland. Yet the Trump campaign always denies that their supporters are are the least bit violent or seeking confrontations with those who disagree with them.

21313,Bombings Near Afghanistanâ€™s Parliament Kill Dozens on Day of Assaults - The New York Times,Mujib Mashal and Taimoor Shah,"KABUL, Afghanistan  â€”   A double bombing by the Taliban near the Afghan Parliament office compound in Kabul on Tuesday killed dozens of people during the   rush hour, officials said. The assault in the Afghan capital was the deadliest of several   attacks on Tuesday, including an explosion at a government guesthouse in the southern province of Kandahar that wounded the provincial governor and the visiting ambassador of the United Arab Emirates. Wahidullah Majrooh, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry, said 80 injured people and 30 bodies were taken to Kabul hospitals. Many officials feared that the number of casualties would rise. The Taliban issued a statement claiming responsibility for the Parliament bombings. One witness who was inside the compound said the attack started when a suicide bomber detonated explosives nearby. Then, as security forces gathered in the area a few minutes later, a car bomb detonated on the busy road that passes in front of the compound, the witness said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. An Afghan lawmaker, Kamal Safi, said meetings were underway in the compound when the attack took place, including one about the national budget. â€œThe explosions took place exactly at the time when government employees were going home, so it was a rush hour,â€ Mr. Safi said. â€œMore than a thousand people are working there, so I know the number of casualties are very high. â€ An officer named Mirwais who was among those providing security for the Parliament building said most of the casualties came from a public bus that was passing by the compound when the car bomb exploded. â€œIt was 4 p. m. and the workers were leaving  â€”   they either had private cars or were walking out to the main road for public transport,â€ Mr. Mirwais said. â€œThe second attack happened on the main road by the gate, and that caused a lot of casualties. â€ Violent attacks in Afghanistan have not subsided this year despite the harsh winter, with Taliban assaults reported on a daily basis across several provinces in the north and the south. The deteriorating situation in the south, in particular, prompted the dispatch of about 200 NATO military advisers to Farah Province. And in Helmand Province, where American and British troops struggled for years to loosen the Talibanâ€™s grip at the height of the war, 300 United States Marines will return to help hold the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, against the insurgents. The attacks in Kabul came hours after a Taliban bomber targeted a meeting of militia commanders in Lashkar Gah, killing seven to 11 people, according to various Afghan officials. The target of that attack revealed the chaotic reality of the province that has been slipping from the hands of the Afghan government: The bombing hit the house of Hajji Khudaidad, a Taliban commander who had recently switched sides to lead a clandestine government force, essentially a duplicate Taliban, to infiltrate insurgency lines, Afghan officials said. Col. Gulai Khan, the security chief of the province, said a meeting was underway at Mr. Khudaidadâ€™s house in the cityâ€™s Second Precinct when the attack happened. â€œThe suicide bomber parked his vehicle laden with explosive nearby the house and walked to the house, where he shot the watchman who was on duty, and later he blew up his explosives inside,â€ Colonel Khan said. He said that seven people were killed and three were wounded, and that a bomb squad was trying to clear the vehicle. Other accounts suggested the attacker might have thrown grenades inside and managed to flee before he was tracked down by the police. Abdul Karim Attal, head of the Helmand provincial council, however, put the number of dead at 11. Among the wounded, officials said, were Mr. Khudaidad and Mullah Ibrahim, a senior commander of a Taliban breakaway faction that is believed to have close ties with the government. Many officials in Helmand said the effort to create the militia was being led by Abdul Jabar Qahraman, President Ashraf Ghaniâ€™s special envoy to the province, who used similar militia tactics in the 1980s on behalf of the collapsing communist government at the time. Mr. Qahraman, in an interview, admitted that he was behind creating such a â€œsecret forceâ€ but denied that the group targeted today was part of it. It amounts to a desperate attempt to break some of the Talibanâ€™s momentum  â€”   the insurgents largely control six districts of the province, the government controls two, and another six are contested, according to Bashir Ahmad Shakir, the head of the security committee at the Helmand provincial council. Details about the attack at the governorâ€™s guesthouse in Kandahar remained scant. Officials said the governor, Humayoon Azizi, was meeting with the visiting ambassador of United Arab Emirates for an evening reception when explosions went off. Gen. Abdul Raziq, the police chief of Kandahar Province, said bombs had been placed in couches in the governorâ€™s house. â€œEleven people have been killed and around 12 have been injured, including the governor and the U. A. E. ambassador, but their conditions are not â€ General Raziq said. â€œThe bodies of the dead are badly burned and beyond recognition. â€"
21314,"Hearings Will Unmask â€˜Swamp Creaturesâ€™ in Trumpâ€™s Cabinet, Democrats Say - The New York Times",Jennifer Steinhauer,"WASHINGTON  â€”   Senate Democrats concede they have little leverage to stop Donald J. Trumpâ€™s cabinet nominees. But that will not discourage them from trying to make life as uncomfortable as possible for many of his choices, with the hope of forcing their Republican colleagues and Mr. Trump to squirm along the way. With nominees like Representative Tom Price, a proponent of fundamental changes to Medicare, to be health secretary, and Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs trader turned hedge fund manager, as Treasury secretary, Democrats hope to use the confirmation hearings to highlight the wide river of incongruities between Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign promises and much of the team he is assembling. The goal: to fuel a narrative that the incoming president, and the Republicans who support him, cannot be trusted. â€œ  Trump promised that he was going to clean up the swamp,â€ said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, â€œand a whole lot of his nominees have had their career in the swamp. â€ One by one, Mr. Schumer said, Democrats will use the confirmation process to highlight positions held by nominees that are either inconsistent with Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign promises or raise the sorts of ethical questions that Democrats tried in vain to hang around Mr. Trumpâ€™s neck during the campaign, like refusing to release his tax returns. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who serves on committees that are likely to have contentious hearings, can be counted on to work over many nominees. â€œWe should know what direction this administration is headed in,â€ Mr. Schumer said. â€œThey didnâ€™t win the election by saying they were going to hire people who want to cut Social Security and Medicare. I will also be looking for any ethical transgressions. â€ For starters, Democrats announced this past week that they would push for a rule requiring all   nominees to provide Congress with their tax returns, a move made to suggest that some of Mr. Trumpâ€™s selections may share    and tax issues with the incoming president. Democrats have themselves to blame for their weakened position in challenging a nominee. In 2013, the Senate voted largely along party lines to remove the   threshold on   and   Court judicial nominees. Mr. Trumpâ€™s nominees will now need the support of only 51 senators to be confirmed Republicans are expected to hold 52 seats next year. â€œAt the end of the day, we were the ones who changed it to 51,â€ said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who voted for the measure. â€œI think itâ€™s important to remember how righteous we were. â€ It is highly unusual for Congress, even in an era of divided government, to outright filibuster cabinet nominees. Republicans have shown broad support for Mr. Trumpâ€™s choices so far, even those lawmakers who have been otherwise critical of him. In one telling move, Senator Susan Collins gave a fast nod to Mr. Trumpâ€™s choice of attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who came under immediate fire by Democrats for his   positions on civil rights issues and his   immigration stance that made him an early Trump ally. In short, Republicans say, bring it on. â€œResponsible Democrats responded to the election by saying they heard the message of the American people and pledged to work with the incoming administration and Republicans in Congress to move America forward,â€ said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. She added, â€œWe hope responsible Democrats wonâ€™t be bullied by the radical left to turn the confirmation process into some political side show. â€ But Democratic lawmakers can make the process afflictive. Mr. Price is expected to receive a particularly hot grilling. As a congressman from Georgia, Mr. Price has been the chief architect of a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has long desired to transform Medicare into a voucherlike program for future participants. Mr. Sessions is likely to undergo tough questioning about accusations of racially insensitive comments from the 1980s that doomed his nomination to be a federal judge and his tentative embrace of Mr. Trumpâ€™s call for a ban on Muslim immigration. That effort seems most likely to backfire because Mr. Sessions has served in the Senate for more than a decade and has a complex record on civil rights back home in Alabama, and his Republican colleagues will likely be quick to defend him. â€œOur friend,â€ said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, referring to Mr. Sessions, â€œis undoubtedly qualified and prepared for this role as attorney general because of the long career he spent protecting and defending our Constitution and the rule of law. â€ Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire Mr. Trump chose to lead the Department of Education, will also be questioned by Democrats for her unwavering support of charter schools, many of which have fared poorly in her state, and tax issues concerning her summer home. â€œThere are a lot of pointed questions I plan to ask,â€ said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the Medicare program and already requires tax returns from nominees. â€œThese nomination hearings are extremely important in that they are going to provide a key opportunity to lay out the concerns we have. â€ Democrats hope that moderate Republicans, especially those up for   in two years, will face an uncomfortable vote on someone like Mr. Price, given the popularity of the Medicare program. â€œAre Republicans going to want to vote for a guy who wants to raise the Medicare eligibility age?â€ said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a done deal. â€ (It probably is a done deal.) But most Democrats seem more interested in pointing out that Mr. Trumpâ€™s nominees largely stand out of step with his campaign promises to â€œdrain the swampâ€ of lobbyists, former bankers and Washington insiders. Mr. Mnuchin is a   veteran of Goldman Sachs, and the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, the choice for commerce secretary, signed a letter in support of the   Partnership trade deal, which Mr. Trump has ridiculed as disastrous. Democrats plan to use the nomination process to underscore the dichotomy. â€œHeâ€™s filling it with bigger swamp creatures,â€ said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who is pressing for nominees to be required to disclose tax returns. And for whatever bumps Mr. Price or Mr. Sessions might face, other nominees will probably breeze through confirmation. Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, whom Mr. Trump has chosen to be his ambassador to the United Nations, and Elaine L. Chao, a former labor secretary whom he has nominated for secretary of transportation, have encountered little opposition. Mr. McConnell is especially excited for Ms. Chao, his wife. â€œI think it was an outstanding choice,â€ he said."

21316,The View From Two Sides of the Standing Rock Front Lines - The New York Times,Jack Healy,"CANNON BALL, N. D.  â€”   The prairie is seething. Work crews are plugging ahead on the   Dakota Access oil pipeline, inching closer and closer to a river crossing that activists view as a critical juncture in their monthslong fight against a $3. 7 billion project that they say will threaten water supplies and that Native Americans say violates their right to sacred land. Last week, clashes erupted between lines of law enforcement officers and protesters. The air was filled with pepper spray and black smoke from burning tires. The authorities arrested 142 people during what local sheriffs denounced as a riot and protesters said was a peaceful demonstration. For months now, Mekasi Horinek and Deputy Jon Moll have lived these demonstrations, day in and day out. But they fall on opposite sides of the front lines, reflecting a community that is as divided as, well, oil and water. Mekasi Horinek, activist Mr. Horinek sees the pipeline protest from the rolling prairies, his arms locked with his fellow Native American activists to sing and pray. He sees tribe members standing up to years of racist slights and   treaties. He sees prayer circles, pipe ceremonies and a unifying fight for clean water. He is the son of Ponca Tribe activists from Oklahoma who took him to rallies when he was a baby. Mr. Horinek, 43, remembers riding on his fatherâ€™s and uncleâ€™s shoulders as they marched with Cesar Chavez in the California  â€™ protests. â€œI canâ€™t remember a time that I wasnâ€™t being taught to stand up for human rights, native rights,â€ he says. He came to North Dakota for a cause. Here is how he describes that cause now: â€œWhat I said to the police officers when I was sitting down in a prayer circle, I asked them, â€˜Donâ€™t you drink water, too? â€™â€ he says. â€œDonâ€™t your children drink water? Weâ€™re here to protect the water. This isnâ€™t just a native issue. Weâ€™re here protecting the water, not only for our families and our children, but for your families and your children. For every ranch and every farm along the Missouri River. â€ Law enforcement officials have accused the protesters of rioting and attacking pipeline contractors, and they have arrested more than 400. But Mr. Horinek says the protesters  â€”   water protectors, they call themselves  â€”   are not the bad guys. He tells a story: Last week, he and 49 other demonstrators decided to link arms and sit together by the overturned earth where the Dakota Access pipeline is slated to go. They were on what the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe considers sacred ancestral land, but from a legal perspective, it is owned by the pipeline company. So sheriffâ€™s officers arrested them for trespassing. Mr. Horinek says he and the others, including his    mother, were   and driven to the county seat, Mandan. He says he had bruises from being tied up so tightly, and from being thrown to the ground and pinned during his arrest. His mother and some of the older people were stiff and sore for days. Officials wrote numbers on their arms  â€”   his was 4838, he says  â€”   and held them overnight in cages in a parking garage, men and women separated by a plastic tarp. They spent the night singing and praying. â€œNo matter what they do to us, theyâ€™re not going to strip our dignity, our honor,â€ Mr. Horinek says. â€œThese are things we hold in our DNA, and weâ€™ll never lose. â€ The next morning, he bailed himself out of jail with money he had been keeping in his wallet in case he was arrested, and headed back to the camp.  Jon Moll, sheriffâ€™s deputy  Deputy Moll sees the pipeline protest through a   windshield, his patrol car slipping along North Dakotaâ€™s gravel county roads. He sees    protesters occupying federal land and trespassing on private ranches. He sees tense confrontations, lost days off and threats to his fellow officers. He is the son of a Lutheran pastor, who moved the family from Ottertail, Minn. to Philadelphia. Mr. Moll, 38, remembers learning about the diversity of this country as the only white child in his class. â€œIâ€™m the son of farmers, and we worked hard for everything we have,â€ he says. He came to Morton County, N. D. for work. Here is how he describes that work now: â€œSometimes, the job sucks, but you do your job. Itâ€™s definitely been a strain. Every time weâ€™ve been out, weâ€™ve seen weapons. People screaming down this road at 100 miles per hour. Trespassing and squatting on federal property. If I wanted to build a house there, Iâ€™d have U. S. marshals knocking on my door, saying, â€˜No, you canâ€™t do that. â€™â€ Activists have accused law enforcement of needlessly roughing up and   demonstrators, and of responding to their   and marches with militarized force. But Mr. Moll says the deputies are not the bad guys. He tells a story: Earlier this fall, about 70 demonstrators rallied at one of the ranches being bisected by the pipeline. Ranchers have grown angry and impatient with the protests and regularly come up to Deputy Moll when he gases up his car to ask him when it will all just be over. He says he sees the Standing Rock Sioux as neighbors and respects them, but he has a harsher view of what he sees as   protesters from outside North Dakota. â€œFolks are terrified,â€ he says. On this day, officials decided to move in and arrest the protesters for trespassing. As they did, some in the crowd started to yell, â€œBring out your horses!â€ to their fellow activists who had parked their trailers in a field of winter wheat. From his patrol car, Mr. Moll says, he saw one of the horses charge directly at a line of officers, and he hit the gas and raced over to cut off the horse as another officer raised a shotgun loaded with beanbag rounds at the rider. â€œYou run a   animal at a   person, thatâ€™s a deadly threat,â€ Mr. Moll said. â€œThey were willing to use the threat of the horse against us, all the while screaming, â€˜Weâ€™re peaceful protesters. â€™â€ He has been working around the protests almost every day since, and expects to be on straight through to Thanksgiving."
21317,"If Britain Favors â€˜Brexit,â€™ Changes Will Come Slowly - The New York Times",Stephen Castle,"LONDON  â€”   If Britain wakes up on Friday morning to the news that it has voted itself out of the European Union, about the only thing that everyone is sure to agree on is that the nation will face a protracted political and legal mess. For all the drama the moment would bring, there would be no instant change. European Union citizens could still come to Britain to live and work without a visa. Trade with the single market would continue unimpeded. Brussels would continue to regulate bananas. Instead, the process of decoupling would officially begin only when the British government chooses to invoke a previously unused provision of the blocâ€™s governing treaty, known as Article 50, that sets out the basics of the withdrawal process. The most critical element of Article 50 is that, once invoked, it sets a   deadline for a negotiated departure. Beyond that, no one really knows how the process would work, since no country has ever left the European Union. Moreover, it is up to the British government when to invoke Article 50, and it is not entirely clear whether Prime Minister David Cameron, who has led the campaign to stay, would stick to his stated plan to invoke it immediately if the country votes to leave. In legal terms, the British government is not even bound by the result of Thursdayâ€™s referendum, which is generally considered a tossup at this point. In a report for the Constitution Society, Richard Gordon and Rowena Moffat said, â€œThe government could, in strict law, choose to ignore it. â€ Most members of Parliament  â€”   including the majority of the governing Conservatives in the House of Commons and nearly all of the opposition Labour Party  â€”   are also opposed to leaving the bloc, though Parliament would probably not get a direct vote on whether or when to invoke Article 50. Politically, however, it would be almost impossible to overlook the outcome of the first plebiscite on Britainâ€™s place in Europe in 41 years. â€œGiven the constitutional significance of the issue at stake,â€ the reportâ€™s authors say, â€œit is inconceivable that the government could choose not to be bound by the result. â€ In fact, one of the few certainties about a vote in favor of Britain leaving the European Union  â€”   a Brexit  â€”   is that initially, at least, it will plunge capitals on both sides of the English Channel, but in Britain in particular, into  complex negotiations and political jockeying that could last for years. Despite Mr. Cameronâ€™s plans to invoke Article 50 swiftly after the vote, he would face pressure to delay starting the   clock from those in his party who favor leaving. Their thinking is that before starting the clock, Britain should start informally negotiating a new trade deal with the European Union in tandem with the terms of Britainâ€™s departure from the bloc. They suggest that Britain would lose considerable leverage in negotiating a new trade deal once it was outside the bloc, and that it could get a better trade deal as part of a negotiation that encompasses all aspects of the new   relationship. Once the   Article 50 term expires, Britain would be outside the single European market for services and become subject to possible tariffs on goods. The   camp does not want to negotiate a new trade pact with that clock ticking. But while Britain might want to move slowly to leave Europe, countries like France and Germany would want to move swiftly, to reduce Britainâ€™s leverage. They can also be expected to take no prisoners in the negotiations, in an effort to limit political contagion by making a tough example of Britain for other member states. Yet there appears to be no mechanism to force Britain to invoke Article 50 and set the   clock running. Mr. Cameronâ€™s assurances that he would do so in the event of a Brexit vote may not count for much, in that he may not survive such an outcome. Were he to quit, it would take the Conservative Party several weeks at least to select a successor. If he loses the referendum but decides to try to remain prime minister, as he has said he would, Britain could be consumed by political maneuvering for weeks or months, postponing a decision on how to proceed. â€œWe donâ€™t know whoâ€™s going to be in charge,â€ said Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at Kingâ€™s College London. â€œThe uncertainty extends to whoâ€™s going to be leading this show. â€ Some Brexit supporters suggest that they could negotiate a departure without using Article 50. By contrast, in Brussels, there is discussion of somehow forcing the British to invoke it. Most legal experts say it would be impossible to avoid. Whatever Conservative government emerges would have to decide what kind of relationship to seek with the European Union, and get the British Parliament on its side for eventual ratification of a new arrangement covering trade and immigration, among other issues. The problem is, fewer than a third of the current Parliament members support leaving the bloc. Stephen Kinnock, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker, has said lawmakers might press for a relationship like Norway has with the European Union  â€”   outside the bloc but still having access to its single market. However, Norway not only pays into the bloc but also accepts the free movement of workers  â€”   two of the biggest and most emotional arguments Brexit supporters have made against membership in the European Union. Analysts say the arguments in Parliament could become so polarized that the government might be forced to seek new elections. But that would require changing a recently passed law on elections, and even then a new Parliament might still be hopelessly divided. Roger Liddle, a   Union member of the House of Lords and a chairman of the Policy Network research institute, said, â€œEven if, as is likely, within weeks of a â€˜leaveâ€™ vote we would have a new Brexit government with a new prime minister, which may be reinforced by a general election victory within six to nine months, it is very unlikely that a majority in either House of Parliament could be found for a credible leave option. â€ A vote to leave the bloc would put Britain in a worse position to curb European migration until it actually departed. In February Mr. Cameron negotiated limits on welfare payments as a disincentive to some European migrants, but this concession is conditional on a vote to remain. Not only would this deal be moot in the event of a Brexit vote, but European citizens might race to enter Britain before the gates are closed. Chris Grayling, a cabinet minister campaigning to leave the bloc, has proposed quick legislation to end the right of free movement before Britain leaves formally, something that would put Britain in breach of European Union law. While European law would be hard to enforce on a country in the blocâ€™s departure lounge, it is unclear whether British lawmakers would approve such a legally contentious step in any case. Even if they did, that would complicate exit negotiations and could provoke retaliatory measures from Continental Europe. If a deal can be reached within the two years, it may need to be ratified in all 28 member nations and perhaps approved by the Parliament in Scotland, where all major parties want to remain in the bloc. Some of those not normally given to hyperbole have deep misgivings about what could go wrong while disentangling Britain from four decades of European integration. â€œThe   ghastliness of the legal complications is almost unimaginable,â€ Sir David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice and professor emeritus at Edinburgh University, told a committee of the House of Lords. Professor Menon said he worries most about the political leadership if Britain leaves: â€œWhoâ€™s providing it, who has the authority to do anything, and whether political contagion spreads to our European partners, which then leads to a hideous, ugly standoff before the negotiations have even started. â€"

[In no particular order, here are five outrages within the text of the nonbinding UNESCO resolution, which was submitted by Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, and Sudan and passed in a   UNESCO vote:  1  â€”   The resolution designates Judaismâ€™s second holiest site, the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, and Judaismâ€™s third holiest site, Rachelâ€™s Tomb, as â€œan integral part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. â€ 2  â€”   The resolution claims it is â€œsafeguardingâ€ the â€œcultural heritage of Palestine,â€ despite the fact that no such country exists. Palestine previously referred to territories that encompass present day Israel and Jordan. It was utilized in the 1917 Balfour Declaration to call for â€œthe establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. â€  In the case of the resolution, UNESCO clearly intended â€œPalestineâ€ to connote a Palestinian state within Israel even though there is no such state. 3  â€”   The text refers to eastern sections of Jerusalem as an entity called â€œEast Jerusalemâ€ in a clear attempt to lobby for the division of Jerusalem. The full clause states: Affirming that nothing in the current decision, which aims, inter alia, at the safeguarding of the cultural heritage of Palestine and the distinctive character of East Jerusalem, shall in any way affect the relevant Security Council and United Nations resolutions and decisions on the legal status of Palestine and Jerusalem, including United Nations Security Council resolution 2334 (2016). In reality, Jerusalem is one city there is no city called East Jerusalem. The term is largely utilized to claim that Israel is occupying â€œEast Jerusalem,â€ and that the city section should become part of a future Palestinian state.   Jews maintained a historic presence in Jerusalem, including in the eastern sections, until they were forced to leave the Old City en masse in 1948. Jordan illegally occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967. The 1967 Six Day War was launched after Arab countries used the territories to stage attacks against the Jewish state.  In 1988, Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and unilaterally recognized terrorist Yasser Arafatâ€™s Palestine Liberation Organization as â€œthe sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. â€ 4  â€”   The resolution refers to Israel as an â€œoccupying powerâ€ in its own capital, Jerusalem. It claims all fundamental Israeli territorial actions in Jerusalem are â€œnull and void. â€ The text states:  Reminding that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and in particular the â€œbasic lawâ€ on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith. In actuality, the Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the authorities in those areas for Israel to be occupying the land from.  The UNESCO resolution further ignores that the Temple Mount and Western Wall  â€”   the holiest sites in Judaism  â€”   are located in eastern Jerusalem, which is steeped in Jewish history. 5  â€”   The resolution forbids Israel to carry out â€œexcavations, tunneling, works and projects in East Jerusalem, particularly in and around the Old City of Jerusalem. â€ The sponsoring countries seem to fear that excavations in these areas routinely uncover archaeological evidence further tying Jews to Jerusalem. For example, discoveries at the City of David, an archeological site just outside the Temple Mount, have unearthed the core of ancient Jerusalem, including Hezekiahâ€™s Tunnel, evidence of the Gihon Spring, Jewish Temple artifacts, Temple purifying pools and more.

21321,5 Movies to See With (and Without) Family Over Thanksgiving - The New York Times,Mekado Murphy,"The Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade has finished, turkey has been consumed and football has been watched. Time for a trip to the movies. Here is a look at five films that Times editors recommend after that last piece of pumpkin pie. If You Want a Family Film for Younger Kids Disneyâ€™s latest animated offering tells the story of an adventurous teenager (Auliâ€™i Cravalho) in search of the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson). The visuals are lush and the songs (some written by the â€œHamiltonâ€ creator   Miranda) are lively, with plenty to hold the whole familyâ€™s attention. If itâ€™s sold out: With crowds expected for â€œMoana,â€ you may need a second choice. Consider â€œTrolls,â€ another     animated movie that has been in theaters a bit longer. If You Want a Family Film for Older Kids Harry Potter himself may not be back, but the wizarding world is at the center of this new film written by J. K. Rowling. The setting is 1926 New York and Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander, a wizard with a suitcase full of unruly creatures. Kids who grew up on the Harry Potter series should feel at home here. The Times critic Manohla Dargis found the titular beasts a highlight, writing, â€œWith the strange caws and showy displays, these beasties provide a lot of the movieâ€™s easygoing pleasures. â€ If itâ€™s sold out: Consider â€œDoctor Strange,â€ Marvelâ€™s latest â€œgiddily enjoyableâ€    adventure film that has been a big draw at the box office, but should be a little easier to get into now that it has been out a few weeks longer. If You Want to Get Away From Family  Done playing nice around the dinner table and seeking a break from the family this holiday? Try this irreverent sequel to the irreverent comedy that became a hit in 2003. Billy Bob Thornton is back as the boozing, womanizing title character. (Did you know he wasnâ€™t the first or even second choice for the role? Find out more in this oral history of the first film.) If You Want to Get Serious After the Holiday For the kind of film that will offer substance as well as a ray of hope, try the   drama â€œArrival. â€ Amy Adams plays a linguist who figures out a way to communicate with alien visitors. It has sleek visual effects and a twisty narrative. In her review, Manohla Dargis praised the lead performance, writing, â€œBy turns inviting and opaque, Ms. Adams turns softness and quiet into heroic qualities, keeping her voice low, modulated, and using stillness to draw you near. â€ If You Want to Keep It Light After Thanksgiving Turkey Stuffed from the meal and in search of a movie that will go down easy? Try the comedy â€œAlmost Christmas. â€ The ensemble film focuses on an Alabama family gathering for the holiday, with comic turns from Danny Glover, Gabrielle Union, Omar Epps, J. B. Smoove and a wisecracking Moâ€™Nique, whom the critic Glenn Kenny called â€œsimply magnificentâ€ in his Times review."

21323,GOOGLE PLANNED MASSIVE AI INTEGRATED SOCIAL NETWORK SPY TOOL FOR HILLARY CAMPAIGN IN 2014,nan,"GOOGLE PLANNED MASSIVE AI INTEGRATED SOCIAL NETWORK SPY TOOL FOR HILLARY CAMPAIGN IN 2014   Source: Higgins News Network 
A newly released Podesta email reveals that Google CEO Eric Schmidt contacted the Hillary campaign in 2014 to begin their partnership in sponsoring Clintonâ€™s campaign run for President in 2016. 
The revelations come from a memo in the email sent to Cherry Mills which was then forwarded Robby Mook, John Podesta, and David Plouffe. 
Schmidtâ€™s memo outlines an overall campaign strategy for Hillary, Schmidtâ€™s vision for a massive cloud-based AI integrate software program and also reveals that Google colluded with the Obama administration in the 2012 election. 
The memo goes on to layout plans to construct a massive cloud-based database, along with programs that leveraged machine learning (aka Artificial Intelligence) that would be used to first to track users online to create a partial digital voter ids. 
Those partial digital ids contain a collection of attributes about the users online behavior which Schmidt explains will all eventually be tied to a real voter id file by leveraging machine learning. 
Schmidt details the procurement of a development team and the use of outline money to create software that will be connected to users smart phones on 2016 that would allow volunteers the ability to access any and all voter data. 
Schmidt also outlines ideas for the using the integrated tool to monitor social media and news stories to help promote positive articles and target the source of â€œrumorsâ€ and negative articles. 
Given Googleâ€™s massive collection of personal user data combined with previous revelations that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg and Facebook COO were colluding with Hillary raises series concerns above user privacy, media manipulation and host of other problems. 
That combined with the fact that just about every other Silicon Valley company and executive is behind the Hillary Campaign makes this a chilling memo that should be getting much more attention than it is.

Fwd: 2016 thoughts 
Date: Tue, Apr 15, 2014 at 1:56 PMSubject: 2016 thoughts 
Cheryl, I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I havescheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better. This is simply a draft but dolet me know if this is a helpful process for you all. Thanks !! Eric 

Notes for a 2016 Democratic CampaignEric Schmidt 
Here are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the 2012campaign. If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position toexecute well for 2016. 
1. Size, Structure and Timing 
Lets assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paidemployees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceasesoperation four days after November 8, 2016 . The structure includes aChairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and aPresident who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements,systems and building and managing the organization. 
Every day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaignright after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best. 
2. Location 
The campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly youngand hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very largehiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic,smart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full ofdistractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhereguarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help. 
The key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work foryou. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all goodexamples of a large, blue state city to base in. 
Employees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find lowcost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis.This worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere. 
The computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services(AWS) . All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smartphones along with credit card reader s. 
3. The pieces of a Campaign 
a) The Field 
Its important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy andempowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up thesystems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people.Initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states.There is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the humansystems. T he field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get outthe vote programs. 
For organizing tools, build a simple way to link people and activities as aworkflow and let the field manage the system, all cloud based. Build asimple organizing tool with a functioning back-end. Avoid deep integrationas the benefits are not worth it. Build on the cloud. Organizing isreally about sharing and linking people, and this tool would measure andtrack all of it. 
There are many other crucial early investments needed in the field:determining the precise list of battleground states, doing early polling toconfirm initial biases, and maintaining and extending voter protectionprograms at the state level. 
b) The Voter 
Key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates allthat is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify,meet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easilyspeak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get thevoter videos and other answers to areas they care about (â€œthe benefits ofACA to youâ€ etc.) 
The scenario includes a volunteer on a walk list, encountering a potentialvoter, updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voterand the information we have to offer. 
c) Digital 
A large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods toconnect to voters, to offer information, to use social networks to spreadgood news, and to raise money. Partners like Blue State Digital will domuch of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partnersto pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load. 
d) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling 
New tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earnedand social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable inreach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and othersurveys. 
Build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors , andmodel how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us aboutthe origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme .Connect polling into this in some way. 
Find a way to do polling online and not on phones. 
e) Analytics and data science and modeling, polling and resourceoptimization tools 
For each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote.Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributesof the needed voters. Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn outand why, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches workwell. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the mostimportant factors for turnout, and preference. 
It should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcomingdatabases from companies like Comcast and others for media measurementpurposes. 
The analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set ofvendors. 
f) Core engineering, voter database and contact with voters online 
The database of voters (NGP Van) is a fine starting point for voter recordsand i s maintained by the vendor (and needs to be converted to the cloud ).The code developed for 2012 (Narwahl etc. ) is unlikely to be used, andreplaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the Van database andintermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter. 
Quite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities withthe actual voter file with high confidence . The key unit of the campaignis a â€œvoterâ€, and each and every record is viewable and updatable byvolunteers in search of more accurate information . 
In the case w here we canâ€™t identify the specific human , we can still have a partial digital voter id , for a person or â€œprobable-personâ€ with attributesthat we can identify and use to targe t. As they respond we can eventuallymatch to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key iseventually matched to a real person . 
The Rules 
Its important that all the player in the campaign work at cost and there beno special interests in the financing structure . This means that allvendors work at cost and there is a separate auditing function to ensure noone is profiting unfairly from the campaign. All investments and conflictsof interest would have to be publicly disclosed. The rules of the auditshould include caps on individual salaries and no investor profits from thecampaign function. (For example, this rule would apply to me.) 
The KEY things 
a) early b uild of an integrated development team and recognition that thisis an entire system that has to be managed as suchb) decisions to exclusively use cloud solutions for scalability, and choiceof vendors and any software from 2012 that will be reused.c) the role of the smart phone in the hands of a volunteer. The smartphone manages the process, updates the database, informs the citizen, andallows fundraising and recruitment of volunteers (on android and iphone).d) early and continued focus of qualifying fundraising dollars to build thefield, and build all the tools. Outside money will be plentiful andperfect for TV use. A smart media mix tool tells all we need to know aboutmedia placement, TV versus other media and digital media .  "
21324,Why You Canâ€™t Lose Weight on a Diet - The New York Times,Sandra Aamodt,"SIX years after dropping an average of 129 pounds on the TV program â€œThe Biggest Loser,â€ a new study reports, the participants were burning about 500 fewer calories a day than other people their age and size. This helps explain why they had regained 70 percent of their lost weight since the showâ€™s finale. The diet industry reacted defensively, arguing that the participants had lost weight too fast or ate the wrong kinds of food  â€”   that diets do work, if you pick the right one. But this study is just the latest example of research showing that in the long run dieting is rarely effective, doesnâ€™t reliably improve health and does more harm than good. There is a better way to eat. The root of the problem is not willpower but neuroscience. Metabolic suppression is one of several powerful tools that the brain uses to keep the body within a certain weight range, called the set point. The range, which varies from person to person, is determined by genes and life experience. When dietersâ€™ weight drops below it, they not only burn fewer calories but also produce more   hormones and find eating more rewarding. The brainâ€™s   system considers your set point to be the correct weight for you, whether or not your doctor agrees. If someone starts at 120 pounds and drops to 80, her brain rightfully declares a starvation state of emergency, using every method available to get that weight back up to normal. The same thing happens to someone who starts at 300 pounds and diets down to 200, as the â€œBiggest Loserâ€ participants discovered. This coordinated brain response is a major reason that dieters find weight loss so hard to achieve and maintain. For example, men with severe obesity have only one chance in 1, 290 of reaching the normal weight range within a year severely obese women have one chance in 677. A vast majority of those who beat the odds are likely to end up gaining the weight back over the next five years. In private, even the diet industry agrees that weight loss is rarely sustained. A report for members of the industry stated: â€œIn 2002, 231 million Europeans attempted some form of diet. Of these only 1 percent will achieve permanent weight loss. â€ The specific â€œBiggest Loserâ€ diet plan is probably not to blame. A previous study found similar metabolic suppression in people who had lost weight and kept it off for up to six years. Whether weight is lost slowly or quickly has no effect on later regain. Likewise  â€”   despite endless debate about the relative value of different approaches  â€”   in    comparisons, diet plans that provide the same calories through different types of food lead to similar weight loss and regain. As a neuroscientist, Iâ€™ve read hundreds of studies on the brainâ€™s ability to fight weight loss. I also know about it from experience. For three decades, starting at age 13, I lost and regained the same 10 or 15 pounds almost every year. On my most serious diet, in my late 20s, I got down to 125 pounds, 30 pounds below my normal weight. I wanted (unwisely) to lose more, but I got stuck. After several months of eating fewer than 800 calories a day and spending an hour at the gym every morning, I hadnâ€™t lost another ounce. When I gave up on losing and switched my goal to maintaining that weight, I started gaining instead. I was lucky to end up back at my starting weight instead of above it. After about five years, 41 percent of dieters gain back more weight than they lost.   studies show dieters are more likely than   to become obese over the next one to 15 years. Thatâ€™s true in men and women, across ethnic groups, from childhood through middle age. The effect is strongest in those who started in the normal weight range, a group that includes almost half of the female dieters in the United States. Some experts argue that instead of dieting leading to   weight gain, the relationship goes in the other direction: People who are genetically prone to gain weight are more likely to diet. To test this idea, in a 2012 study, researchers followed over 4, 000 twins aged 16 to 25. Dieters were more likely to gain weight than their   identical twins, suggesting that dieting does indeed increase weight gain even after accounting for genetic background. The difference in weight gain was even larger between fraternal twins, so dieters may also have a higher genetic tendency to gain. The study found that a single diet increased the odds of becoming overweight by a factor of two in men and three in women. Women who had gone on two or more diets during the study were five times as likely to become overweight. The causal relationship between diets and weight gain can also be tested by studying people with an external motivation to lose weight. Boxers and wrestlers who diet to qualify for their weight classes presumably have no particular genetic predisposition toward obesity. Yet a 2006 study found that elite athletes who competed for Finland in such   sports were three times more likely to be obese by age 60 than their peers who competed in other sports. To test this idea rigorously, researchers could randomly assign people to worry about their weight, but that is hard to do. One program took the opposite approach, though, helping teenage girls who were unhappy with their bodies to become less concerned about their weight. In a randomized trial, the eBody Project, an online program to fight eating disorders by reducing girlsâ€™ desire to be thin, led to less dieting and also prevented future weight gain. Girls who participated in the program saw their weight remain stable over the next two years, while their peers without the intervention gained a few pounds. WHY would dieting lead to weight gain? First, dieting is stressful. Calorie restriction produces stress hormones, which act on fat cells to increase the amount of abdominal fat. Such fat is associated with medical problems like diabetes and heart disease, regardless of overall weight. Second, weight anxiety and dieting predict later binge eating, as well as weight gain. Girls who labeled themselves as dieters in early adolescence were three times more likely to become overweight over the next four years. Another study found that adolescent girls who dieted frequently were 12 times more likely than   to binge two years later. My repeated dieting eventually caught up with me, as this research would predict. When I was in graduate school and under a lot of stress, I started binge eating. I would finish a carton of ice cream or a box of saltines with butter, usually at 3 a. m. The urge to keep eating was intense, even after I had made myself sick. Fortunately, when the stress eased, I was able to stop. At the time, I felt terrible about being out of control, but now I know that binge eating is a common mammalian response to starvation. Much of what we understand about weight regulation comes from studies of rodents, whose eating habits resemble ours. Mice and rats enjoy the same wide range of foods that we do. When tasty food is plentiful, individual rodents gain different amounts of weight, and the genes that influence weight in people have similar effects in mice. Under stress, rodents eat more sweet and fatty foods. Like us, both laboratory and wild rodents have become fatter over the past few decades. In the laboratory, rodents learn to binge when deprivation alternates with tasty food  â€”   a situation familiar to many dieters. Rats develop binge eating after several weeks consisting of five days of food restriction followed by two days of free access to Oreos. Four days later, a brief stressor leads them to eat almost twice as many Oreos as animals that received the stressor but did not have their diets restricted. A small taste of Oreos can induce deprived animals to binge on regular chow, if nothing else is available. Repeated food deprivation changes dopamine and other neurotransmitters in the brain that govern how animals respond to rewards, which increases their motivation to seek out and eat food. This may explain why the animals binge, especially as these brain changes can last long after the diet is over. In people, dieting also reduces the influence of the brainâ€™s   system by teaching us to rely on rules rather than hunger to control eating. People who eat this way become more vulnerable to external cues telling them what to eat. In the modern environment, many of those cues were invented by marketers to make us eat more, like advertising, supersizing and the     buffet. Studies show that   dieters are more likely to eat for emotional reasons or simply because food is available. When dieters who have long ignored their hunger finally exhaust their willpower, they tend to overeat for all these reasons, leading to weight gain. Even people who understand the difficulty of   weight loss often turn to dieting because they are worried about health problems associated with obesity like heart disease and diabetes. But our cultureâ€™s view of obesity as uniquely deadly is mistaken. Low fitness, smoking, high blood pressure, low income and loneliness are all better predictors of early death than obesity. Exercise is especially important: Data from a 2009 study showed that low fitness is responsible for 16 percent to 17 percent of deaths in the United States, while obesity accounts for only 2 percent to 3 percent, once fitness is factored out. Exercise reduces abdominal fat and improves health, even without weight loss. This suggests that overweight people should focus more on exercising than on calorie restriction. In addition, the evidence that dieting improves peopleâ€™s health is surprisingly poor. Part of the problem is that no one knows how to get more than a small fraction of people to sustain weight loss for years. The few studies that overcame that hurdle are not encouraging. In a 2013 study of obese and overweight people with diabetes, on average the dieters maintained a 6 percent weight loss for over nine years, but the dieters had a similar number of heart attacks, strokes and deaths from heart disease during that time as the control group. Earlier this year, researchers found that intentional weight loss had no effect on mortality in overweight diabetics followed for 19 years. Diets often do improve cholesterol, blood sugar and other health markers in the short term, but these gains may result from changes in behavior like exercising and eating more vegetables. Obese people who exercise, eat enough vegetables and donâ€™t smoke are no more likely to die young than   people with the same habits. A 2013   (which combines the results of multiple studies) found that health improvements in dieters have no relationship to the amount of weight they lose. If dieting doesnâ€™t work, what should we do instead? I recommend mindful eating  â€”   paying attention to signals of hunger and fullness, without judgment, to relearn how to eat only as much as the brainâ€™s   system commands. Relative to chronic dieters, people who eat when theyâ€™re hungry and stop when theyâ€™re full are less likely to become overweight, maintain more stable weights over time and spend less time thinking about food. Mindful eating also helps people with eating disorders like binge eating learn to eat normally. Depending on the individualâ€™s set point, mindful eating may reduce weight or it may not. Either way, itâ€™s a powerful tool to maintain weight stability, without deprivation. I finally gave up dieting six years ago, and Iâ€™m much happier. I redirected the energy I used to spend on dieting to establishing daily habits of exercise and meditation. I also enjoy food more while worrying about it less, now that it no longer comes with a side order of shame."

21326,Wells Fargo Needs to Make a Clean Break With the Past - The New York Times,Gretchen Morgenson,"Even after two big shuffles at the top, Wells Fargo is still working from the same playbook. And for the bankâ€™s stockholders, that could mean more frustration lies ahead. John Stumpf abruptly exited late Wednesday from his chief executive and chairman posts at the bank, taking responsibility for the bankâ€™s phony accounts disaster. But the elevation of Timothy J. Sloan, the Wells Fargo president and former chief operating officer, to succeed Mr. Stumpf, and the simultaneous appointment of an independent board chairman seem like incremental moves from a bank that really needs a   to repair the damage. Is Mr. Sloan, an almost   veteran of Wells Fargo and a seasoned insider, the best executive to lead the bank out of crisis? Some of the experts I talked to donâ€™t think so. Sarah Bloom Raskin, deputy secretary of the United States Treasury and a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said that Wells Fargo needed to shift from a reactive   stance to proactive risk management. And this may require more significant change than the company is offering. â€œThe whole country is watching to see if this bank is seizing the opportunity to make a clean break from doing business in a way that strains its reputation with its customers to one that enhances it,â€ Ms. Raskin said. â€œThis is an opportunity to bring in a new perspective at the top. â€ Mr. Sloan may indeed be a great manager. But one of the big questions looming over him is whether his long tenure at Wells Fargo is an asset or a liability. Richard Bove, a veteran bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, said Wells Fargo needed an overhaul that went far beyond the scandal itself. Yes, repairing the culture that allowed the fraudulent practices to occur is a crucial task for Mr. Sloan, but that alone will not get the bank back on track. In recent years, Wells Fargoâ€™s competitors, Mr. Bove said, have vastly improved their operations by exiting significant businesses and selling off assets. Citigroup has gotten out of 30 businesses and sold off a large number of assets, he said. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have also downsized. But Wells Fargo has added lines of business during the period, Mr. Bove said, resulting in a bloated bank. â€œThis is a company that must make massive revisions to its business model,â€ Mr. Bove said. â€œSomeone has to get in there and rip the company apart. Sloan is not the guy to do that. â€ There is also a question about Mr. Sloanâ€™s previous position as the bankâ€™s chief financial officer from February 2011 to May 2014. In that post, Mr. Sloan was required to sign periodic certifications that he had disclosed to the companyâ€™s auditors and the audit committee of the board any fraud involving management or other employees that had a significant role in the companyâ€™s internal controls. The pervasive opening of sham accounts, a practice in a division overseen by Carrie Tolstedt, also a top Wells Fargo executive, would certainly seem to qualify as fraud relating to the bankâ€™s internal controls. Did Mr. Sloan make disclosures about these practices to the board during his stint as chief financial officer? If not, why not? And if he did, why were the disclosures not acted on years ago? I asked these questions of Wells Fargo. A spokeswoman, Arati Randolph, emphasized that the bank had determined that the financial impact of the problematic practices was not meaningful. â€œThe vast majority of the accounts reviewed did not generate fees or result in net income for the company,â€ Ms. Randolph said in a statement. â€œIn fact, it cost Wells Fargo more than $10 million to open and service those accounts, which generated the $2. 6 million in fees that was returned to customers. â€ Certainly, the bankâ€™s shareholders are hoping that Mr. Sloanâ€™s rise will stop the fall in the companyâ€™s share price. Wells Fargoâ€™s stock has lost almost $28 billion in market value since early September, when the bank announced its settlement with regulators over the dubious practices. On Friday, after Mr. Sloan held a conference call with analysts, the stock fell 0. 6 percent from the previous dayâ€™s close. Annalisa Barrett, a clinical professor of finance at the University of San Diego school of business, thinks the bank may be making the best of a bad situation. She argued that the investor reaction could have been worse had the board announced it was looking for an outsider to replace Mr. Stumpf. â€œThey likely would have named an interim C. E. O. while they conducted their search,â€ she said. â€œIn my opinion, that would have been very disruptive and led to more uncertainty in the market and concern among employees and customers. â€ Given the sad sequence of events at Wells Fargo, I couldnâ€™t help but wonder: Why does it take a crisis of this magnitude to get a company or its board to act on governance matters that its shareholders have been agitating about? One such matter involves who runs the Wells Fargo board. For years, the position of chairman was held by the companyâ€™s chief executive, most recently Mr. Stumpf. This meant that the same person presided over the board even as he oversaw the bankâ€™s operations. Recently, companies whose chief executives also lead their boards have come under pressure from investors who think these responsibilities should be divided to ensure an appropriate balance of power. At Wells Fargoâ€™s annual shareholder meeting in April, for example, investors were once again asked to vote on a proposal that would have required an independent chairman to replace Mr. Stumpf in that role. Such a proposal has come up at the bank every year for more than a decade. Each time, Wells Fargo has recommended that shareholders nix it and each time the bank has gotten its way. This year was no different. But in arguing against the proposal, Wells Fargo made the following points. Its existing board structure, the company said, â€œprovides effective independent oversight of management and board accountabilityâ€ and its governance is â€œworking effectively as evidenced by the companyâ€™s strong financial performance. â€ Well, so much for that. On Wednesday, the company did an   indicating that its governance prowess might not have been as effective as the company had contended. In his new position as C. E. O. Mr. Sloan will not become board chairman. That assignment now goes to Stephen W. Sanger, retired chief executive and chairman of General Mills, who will be assisted by Elizabeth A. Duke, a former Federal Reserve Board governor, as vice chairwoman. These two directors have a lot on their plates. They are essentially charged with waking up what has been a somnambulant board. Ms. Duke joined the Wells Fargo board only in early 2015, so she cannot be held responsible for overlooking years of problematic activities. Mr. Sanger, on the other hand, has been a Wells Fargo director since 2003. And since 2012, he has held the position of lead independent director of the bankâ€™s board. In that job, he was supposed to ensure that Mr. Stumpf was putting his shareholdersâ€™ interests first. That didnâ€™t happen then, but it better happen now."
21327,Treasury Department Shoots Down Fannie and Freddie Obamacare Conspiracy Theory - Breitbart,John Carney,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has not endorsed   claims that profits from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were diverted to fund Obamacare, a spokesman said. [Mnuchin also supports the ongoing sweep of the profits of the   giants into the U. S. Treasury, the spokesman said.  Special interest groups have been falsely claiming for several months that the Obama administration was diverting the profits of the   giants to provide funding for portions of Obamacare for which Congress has declined to appropriate funds. These efforts have been aimed at manipulating conservative opponents of Obamacare into supporting efforts by hedge funds and other investors to suspend the quarterly dividends the companies pay to Treasury. In reality, the funds collected by Fannie and Freddie count as revenue to the U. S. Treasury, much like tax receipts, and are used to fund general government operations. There is no particular connection to Obamacare. Following an interview with Maria Bartiromo at a Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles Monday,   advocates of Fannie and Freddieâ€™s shareholders claimed Mnuchin had endorsed their position. â€œMnuchin Confirms GSE Sweep May Have Funded Obamacare,â€ declared a pressure group called Investorâ€™s Unite. What Mnuchin actually confirmed is much more mundane and widely known: the profits of Fannie and Freddie that get turned over each quarter to the U. S. Treasury as compensation for their bailout and Treasuryâ€™s ongoing support are used to fund the operations of the U. S. government. â€œSecretary Mnuchin believes the dividend from the GSEs should be paid per the agreement as compensation for the government.  The Secretary clearly stated that the dividends were used to fund other parts of the government more broadly,â€ a Treasury spokesman said. Mnuchinâ€™s ongoing support for the payments to the U. S. Treasury was first reported by Bloomberg News. The confusion appears to have arisen because of the way Bartiromo worded her question. â€œThereâ€™s a conversation going on on Twitter and it has been for a long time about how President Obama needed money for ObamaCare and would take from all of the agencies and he took from Fannie and Freddie. Is that true?â€ Bartiromo asked Mnuchin. â€œIt is true. They used the profits of Fannie and Freddie to pay for other parts of the government while they kept taxpayers at risk,â€ the Treasury Secretary replied. Treasuryâ€™s statement Wednesday, however, makes it clear that Mnuchinâ€™s answer was not meant to confirm any particular connection between Obamacare and the profits of Fannie and Freddie. Because money is fungible, Treasuryâ€™s receipts of those profits fund everything the federal government does from border patrols and military operations to the National Endowment for the Arts and public television.  In the interview with Bartiromo, Mnuchin also shot down the idea that the administration has plans to privatize Fannie and Freddie or return them to shareholder control, specifically rejecting the word â€œprivatized. â€ â€œLet me ask you about Fannie and Freddie, because youâ€™ve talked a lot about the need for these two housing giants to be privatized. Where is that in your priority list?â€ Bartiromo asked. â€œAgain, I havenâ€™t said they would be privatized. What Iâ€™ve said is Iâ€™m committed to housing reform, and that weâ€™re committed not to leave them as is for the next four years,â€ Mnuchin said. Fannie and Freddie provide liquidity to the housing market by buying mortgages from lenders, packaging them into securities whose principal and interest payments they guarantee. Prior to their 2008 collapse, Fannie and Freddie were widely viewed as enjoying an â€œimplicit guaranteeâ€ from the U. S. government, enabling them to earn enormous profits because investors viewed their bonds as being safe â€”  or nearly so â€”  as U. S. Treasury bonds, The companies were taken over by the U. S. government in 2008 when officials feared their collapse could further destabilize the housing and financial markets. Treasury provided hundreds of billions of funding while the Federal Housing Finance Agency became their conservator.   Under their original agreement with the U. S. Treasury, both companies were supposed to pay a dividend equal to 10% of their taxpayer funding as well as a fee on the hundreds of billions more Treasury had pledged to support them. For years, however, neither company earned enough to pay the dividend, which forced them to draw even more from their bailout funds just to send the money back to Treasury as the dividend. This circular draw, as it came to be called, threatened to put the companies into a death spiral, slowly eating away at the remainder of the Treasury backstop. In   Treasury and the FHFA agreed to change the terms of the bailout so that Fannie and Freddie would no longer have a fixed dividend â€”  ending the need for circular draws. Instead, each company would have a flexible dividend obligation that would rise and fall with their profits. Because the new dividend is equal to the positive net worth of each company, less a small capital cushion set to decline each year, it is known as the â€œnet worth sweep. â€ At the time the net worth sweep was implemented, Treasury Department officials noted that in addition to ending the circular draws and death spiral, the arrangement would facilitate the eventual wind down of the companies by preventing them from using profits to recapitalize as   designed a safe, more stable mortgage finance system. Because every attempt at bipartisan mortgage finance reform legislation stalled out on Capitol Hill, neither company has been  . Instead, they have remained in conservatorship and supported by taxpayer backing for more than eight years â€”  a situation that nearly everyone involved in mortgage finance reform regards as undesirable. Hedge funds and other big investors who have purchased shares of Fannie and Freddie, including Perry Capital LLC and the Fairholme Funds, have been attempting to undo the net worth sweep for years. These attempts have included marshaling support of civil rights groups and filing lawsuits in several federal courts. The litigation tactic, however, has largely failed. The cases have been met by dismissal in four federal district courts and a federal appeals court in March largely rejected the bid by investors to reverse one of those decisions. As Breitbart news reported last month, opponents of the net worth sweep have recently turned to the Obamacare conspiracy theory, which appears   to lure in conservatives.  to bankroll portions of the Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the funds were allegedly used to provide a substitute funding source after a federal court ruled that some subsidies that had been provided to insurers were improper. The trouble is that the changes to Fannie and Freddieâ€™s bailout that net worth sweep in place were made in 2012, while the judgeâ€™s ruling on the Obamacare subsidies didnâ€™t come until 2016. Whatâ€™s more, the judge in the case has allowed the payments to continue pending appeal, which means there still isnâ€™t a budget gap to fill. So this theory lacks even a patina of plausibility.  Treasuryâ€™s statement rejecting this conspiracy theory is likely to be another source of disappointment for those who hoped they had found an   worth sweep ally in Mnuchin."

21329,Donald Trump Is the 45th President of the United States Â· Guardian Liberty Voice,Cathy Milne,"After a long night and a hard election, Donald J. Trump was elected as the 45th President of the United States. In the early hours of November 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the election.
Both candidates helped usher in a new political era; she is the first woman to get this far in a presidential election successfully. Whereas, Trump is the first person to be elected to the highest office in the U.S. who never served in the military and never served in a political capacity.
When the night culminated with Trump winning well over the required 270 electoral votes, the election was called. The reality star now holds a new title, President Elect Donald J. Trump.
His presidency will begin with Republicans holding the majority in both chambers of Congress. President-Elect Trump will be nominating a new Supreme Court Justice to fill the seat vacated when Antonin Scalia died in February.
Surprising Night at the Polls On November 8, the polls began to close at 6:00 p.m. ET on the east coast. Whereas on the west coast, the polls closed 11:00 p.m. There were early projections, which made hearts race. The numbers bounced back and forth in many key swing states. That is until eastern stateâ€™s tallies began to roll in, then the numbers evened out.
Polling Site Glitches Many polling sites experienced technical issues. Trump attempted early in the day to sue Nevada because the polls in Clark County remained open for an hour and a half on Nov. 7. The judge stated there was no fraud since the stateâ€™s law indicates if a person is in line before the polling site closes, they must be allowed to cast their ballot.
In Durham County, N.C., there was a delay beginning the votes, so the Democratic Party sought to have the time extended to make up for time lost. This was granted, and the polls remained open for 30 of the 45 minutes requested.
Donald Trump Needs to Reunite the Country Commentators on CNN Politics agree that the campaign tore through the fabric that makes America great. During the campaigning, citizens became polarized into two drastically divisive and hateful camps.
How is President Elect Trump going to heal the wounds he inflicted on Clintonâ€™s supporters, the Muslim community, Latino citizens, and every other group?
During Trumpâ€™s campaign, he threatened to have Clinton arrested when he won, build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, close the mosques, and restart stop and search policies. He said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and lower the tax ceiling for the richest Americans.
His supporters are thrilled, and Clintonâ€™s voters are stunned. There are fear and confusion in the air.
Hillary Clinton Concedes Clinton sent out her campaign manager to tell her supporters that it was late and the final tallies were not going to happen soon. She asked them to go home and get some rest. The announcement was made that Clinton would speak in the morning.
Within an hour, Trump told his supporters that she had called him and conceded. The President-Elect proffered a simple acceptance. He stated that his was not a campaign but a movement for change.

21332,"Drink to Your Health (in Moderation), the Science Says - The New York Times",Aaron E. Carroll,"Over the past year, Iâ€™ve tried to clear up a lot of the misconceptions on food and drink: about salt, artificial sweeteners, among others, even water. Now let me take on alcohol: wine, beer and cocktails. Although I have written about the dangerous effects of alcohol abuse and misuse, that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s always bad. A part of many complex and delicious adult beverages, alcohol is linked to a number of health benefits in medical studies. That doesnâ€™t mean the studies provide only good news, either, or that the evidence in its favor is a slam dunk. You wonâ€™t be surprised to hear that, once again, my watchword  â€”   moderation  â€”   applies. Research into how alcohol consumption affects health has been going on for a long time. A 1990 prospective cohort study included results of more than 275, 000 men followed since 1959. Compared with those who never drank alcohol, those who consumed one to two drinks a day had a significantly reduced mortality rate from both coronary heart disease and â€œall causes. â€ Those who consumed three or more drinks a day still had a lower risk of death from coronary heart disease, but had a higher mortality rate over all. A 2004 study came to similar conclusions. It followed about 6, 600 men and 8, 000 women for five years and found that compared with those who drank about one drink a day on average, those who didnâ€™t drink at all and those who drank more than two drinks a day had higher rates of death. Results like these have been consistent across a number of studies in different populations. Even studies published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research agree that moderate drinking seems to be associated with a decreased risk of death over all. However, alcohol seems to have different effects on different diseases. Almost all of the major benefits of drinking are seen in cardiovascular illnesses. In fact, with men, even consumption of a surprisingly large amount can seem protective. When it comes to cancer, the picture isnâ€™t as rosy. For instance, a 2007 study involving the Womenâ€™s Health Study cohort found that increased alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. More broadly, a 2014 systematic review of epidemiologic and experimental studies looking at alcohol and breast cancer found that the overall consensus is that each additional drink per day increases the relative risk (comparing the risk in two groups) of breast cancer by a statistically significant, but small, 2 percent  â€”   although not the absolute risk. A   of colorectal cancer and alcohol found that heavy drinkers, but not light or moderate drinkers, were at increased risk of the disease. No relationship is seen with respect to bladder cancer or ovarian cancer. A study that included all cancers found that light drinking was protective moderate drinking had no effect and heavy drinking was detrimental. Moderate alcohol consumption has been found to be associated with other benefits, though. A cohort of about 6, 000 people followed in Britain found that those who consumed alcohol at least once a week had significantly better cognitive function in middle age than those who did not drink at all. This protective effect on cognition was seen in people who drank up to 30 drinks a week. A 2004 systematic review found that moderate drinking was associated with up to 56 percent lower rates of diabetes compared with nondrinkers. Heavy drinkers, though, had an increased incidence of diabetes. This is where savvy readers should be asking: What about randomized controlled trials? After all, epidemiologic evidence and associations only go so far they cannot get us to causation. Recently, in Annals of Internal Medicine, such a trial was published. Patients with   Type 2 diabetes were randomized to drink 150 milliliters of water, white wine or red wine with dinner for two years. The beverages were provided to patients free of charge. They were all placed on a Mediterranean diet with no calorie restrictions. Researchers found that those who drank the wine, most notably red wine, had a reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors, or those for heart disease, diabetes or stroke. This was especially true in patients who had certain genotypes. Further, no one had any significant adverse effects from being randomized to drink the alcohol. In another analysis of that  randomized control trial published this year, the most interesting finding was about blood pressure. In this study, some people saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure. Again, the alcohol was not associated with significant adverse effects. This contradicts the findings from systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies that show alcohol intake may be associated with a small but significant increase in blood pressure. Adding further complications was a   trial looking at red wine consumption that found it had no effect, positive or negative, on blood pressure in patients with atherosclerosis. A different analysis of that study found that it did result in improved cholesterol levels, even though many patients were already being treated with statins. A 2011   examined 63 controlled trials of wine, beer and spirits, and found that all of those beverages increased levels of HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). There was even a   with more alcohol consumed having more of an effect. Synthesizing all this, there seems to be a sizable amount of evidence that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with decreased rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and death. It also seems to be associated with increased rates, perhaps to a lesser extent, of some cancers, especially breast cancer, as well as some other diseases or conditions. The gains from improved cardiovascular disease deaths seem to outweigh all of the losses in other diseases combined. The most recent report of the U. S. D. A. Scientific Advisory Panel agrees with that assessment. But alcohol isnâ€™t harmless. Many people with certain diseases or disorders, and women who are pregnant, need to avoid it. Others who canâ€™t keep their consumption to acceptable levels need to abstain. Alcohol is very harmful when abused, so much so that itâ€™s difficult for me to tell people to start drinking for their health. Thatâ€™s rarely the conclusion of any studies about alcohol, no matter how positive the results. Nor is it the advice any doctors I know give. However, the evidence does seem to say that moderate consumption is safe, and that it may even be healthy for many people. If youâ€™re enjoying some drinks this holiday season, itâ€™s nice to know that they may be doing more than just bringing you cheer."
21333,Global Unrest Cycle Elects Evangelical Mayor for Rio,nan,"Global Unrest Cycle Elects Evangelical Mayor for Rio October 31, 2016 Global Unrest Cycle Elects Evangelical Mayor for Rio 
An evangelical bishop was elected mayor of Rio de Janeiro on Sunday in a second round of municipal voting that cemented a rout of the leftist party and allies who dominated Brazil's presidency and major cities for over a decade. Marcelo Crivella, a controversial conservative who is a senator, bishop and nephew of the founder of an evangelical megachurch, defeated a progressive former schoolteacher to runBrazil's second biggest city by a margin of nearly 20 percentage points. The 59-year-old pastor weathered an uproar over past criticism of homosexuality and Catholicism, the dominant religion in Latin America's largest country, by distancing himself from those comments and vowing to govern for Rio's residents, not the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the influential congregation from which he hails. In a victory speech to supporters in a working-class Rio neighborhood, he promised to ""take care of people,"" echoing campaign vows to improve deficient public services, from health to transport to sanitation, that complicate day-to-day life for the blue-collar voters who supported his candidacy. Crivella's victory, partly fueled by the growing influence of evangelical voters, fortifies a rightward shift in Brazil following the 13-year reign of the leftist Workers Party, which presided over a long economic boom before cratering during the recession and an historic corruption scandal. 
(BRAZIL) - The elections, which toppled many incumbents in a first round of voting earlier this month, are also a broader renunciation of the status quo, with voters frustrated by a second year of recession and the giant kickback scandal that has led to the arrest dozens of political and corporate chieftains. 
""It's an important election to change the old way of doing things,"" said Rafael Mello, a civil servant who voted Sunday morning in Rio. 
In the first round of voting, just weeks after lawmakers impeached former President Dilma Rousseff because of budget irregularities by her Workers Party government, two-term Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, a one-time Rousseff ally, failed to secure a place in the runoff for his hand-picked successor candidate.

In SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil's biggest city and the cradle of the Workers Party, voters ousted Mayor Fernando Haddad, once considered one of the party's rising stars. The Workers Party held onto only one of the state capitals it had previously occupied. 
EYEING 2018 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Sunday's voting will also influence how some key players at the national level could fare ahead of the 2018 presidential elections. 
In Belo Horizonte, capital of the rich southeastern state of Minas Gerais, a loss by a candidate from the centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party is expected to help resolve an ongoing power struggle within the PSDB, as the party is known. 
The PSDB, which had been the chief opposition to the Workers Party and is increasingly well positioned to retake the presidency after four consecutive defeats, won SÃ£o Paulo and other important cities in the first round of municipal elections. 
The victory by wealthy businessman JoÃ£o Doria in SÃ£o Paulo fortified Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of that state and a possible presidential candidate, who pushed for Doria despite opposition from other PSDB leaders. 
The loss in Belo Horizonte, to a smaller centrist party, is considered a defeat for Aecio Neves, another PSDB leader who was the party's candidate against Rousseff in 2014. Neves, a senator and former governor of Minas Gerais, failed to win the state in that election and gave his imprimatur to this year's losing mayoral candidate. 
Crivella, the Rio victor, belongs to the Brazilian Republican Party, a relatively new conservative party. 
His leftist rival, Marcelo Freixo, represented the Socialism and Liberty Party, which broke away from the Workers Party over a decade ago to focus on human rights, education and social issues. 
Though Freixo garnered energetic support from celebrities, artists, intellectuals and prosperous Rio leftists, their ballots were easily outnumbered by a populist vote in less affluent parts of the city, traditionally skeptical of progressive platforms.

21334,The Modern History of â€˜Riggedâ€™ US Elections,Consortiumnews.com,"The Modern History of â€˜Riggedâ€™ US Elections October 27, 2016 
Special Report: Donald Trump claims the U.S. presidential election is â€œrigged,â€ drawing condemnation from the political/media establishment which accuses him of undermining faith in American democracy. But neither side understands the real problem, says Robert Parry. 
By Robert Parry 
The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worldâ€™s â€œgold standardâ€ that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The â€œwise menâ€ of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizensâ€™ judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan photographed together in the Oval Office in 1991. (Cropped from a White House photo that also included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.) 
Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nationâ€™s leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldnâ€™t vote). 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedyâ€™s vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Southâ€™s heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixonâ€™s Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. 
Nixonâ€™s â€˜Treasonâ€™ 
So, by 1968, the Democratsâ€™ once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnâ€™t want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that â€” with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided â€” President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. President Richard Nixon with his then-National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972. 
The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixonâ€™s campaign went behind Johnsonâ€™s back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsonâ€™s Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixonâ€™s emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam. 
Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixonâ€™s â€œtreasonâ€ â€” from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election â€” he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford â€“ three pillars of the Establishment â€“ expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking: 
â€œSome elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Iâ€™m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected,â€ Clifford said. â€œIt could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countryâ€™s interests.â€ 
Cliffordâ€™s words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americaâ€™s electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process. 
To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixonâ€™s treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the libraryâ€™s archivists call the file on Nixonâ€™s sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their â€œX-file.â€ [For details, see Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ LBJâ€™s â€˜X-Fileâ€™ on Nixonâ€™s â€˜Treason. â€™â€] 
The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixonâ€™s paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his â€œtreasonâ€ â€“ top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJâ€™s presidency â€“ led to Nixonâ€™s creation of the â€œplumbers,â€ a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the â€œplumbersâ€ became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s headquarters at the Watergate in Washington.

Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixonâ€™s far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnsonâ€™s Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixonâ€™s sabotage â€” and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome â€” the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .â€] 
In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixonâ€™s strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidentâ€™s foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign. 
Reaganâ€™s â€˜October Surpriseâ€™ Caper 
In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reaganâ€™s campaign feared that Carter might pull off an â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reaganâ€™s team take action to block Carterâ€™s October Surprise? President Ronald Reagan, delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran are simultaneously released. 
The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reaganâ€™s team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carterâ€™s October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixonâ€™s Paris peace talk maneuver. 
That evidence indicates that Reaganâ€™s campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostagesâ€™ release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reaganâ€™s vice presidential running mate. 
By early November 1980, the publicâ€™s obsession with Iranâ€™s humiliation of the United States and Carterâ€™s inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reaganâ€™s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan. 
Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class. 
Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Iranâ€™s cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb. 11, 1981. (Photo credit: Reagan Library) 
In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview: 
â€œIt was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. â€¦ [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.â€ 
Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reaganâ€™s beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguaâ€™s leftist government. 
While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there. 
A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt. 
Tired of the Story 
By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991. PBS Frontlineâ€™s: The Election Held Hostage, co-written by Robert Parry and Robert Ross. 
However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israelâ€™s exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseyâ€™s attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages. 
Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic â€œLondon alibiâ€ would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidentâ€™s flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation. 
Meanwhile, Bushâ€™s State Department and White House counselâ€™s office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena. 
Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassyâ€™s confirmation of Caseyâ€™s trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape. 
Williamson said that among the State Department â€œmaterial potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown,â€ Beach noted in a â€œ memorandum for record â€ dated Nov. 4, 1991. 
Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachâ€™s boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushâ€™s reelection hopes in 1992. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush. 
At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bushâ€™s reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to â€œkill/spike this story.â€ 
Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. â€œWhatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate â€˜October Surpriseâ€™ investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President ,â€ Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.] 
Among â€œtouchstonesâ€ cited by Gray were â€œNo Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan.â€ White House â€œtalking pointsâ€ on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings. 
Timid Democrats 
But Bushâ€™s White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received â€“ and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993 â€“ there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reaganâ€™s election victory. Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana. 
That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process â€“ and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be â€œgood for the country.â€ 
In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachâ€™s memo regarding Caseyâ€™s trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forceâ€™s dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue. 
â€œThe [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the tripâ€ to Madrid, Hamilton told me. â€œShould they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.â€ 
Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forceâ€™s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forceâ€™s investigation. 
â€œIf the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us,â€ Hamilton said, adding that â€œyou have to rely on peopleâ€ in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquiryâ€™s failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was naÃ¯ve in the extreme. 
Arguably, Hamiltonâ€™s timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushâ€™s team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamiltonâ€™s investigative conclusion reinforced the â€œgroup thinkâ€ dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a â€œconspiracy theoryâ€ when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasnâ€™t done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent. 
Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didnâ€™t make any sense . 
But the dismissive â€œgroup thinkâ€ remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned. [For details, see Robert Parryâ€™s Americaâ€™s Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ Second Thoughts on October Surprise. â€] 
Past as Prologue 
Lee Hamiltonâ€™s decision to â€œclearâ€ Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushâ€™s rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000. President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper) 
Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the fatherâ€™s role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, itâ€™s hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush â€œstolen electionâ€ in 2000. 
Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridaâ€™s electoral votes and thus the presidency. 
The reality of Goreâ€™s rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridaâ€™s disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted. 
However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be â€œgood for the country.â€ 
So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery â€“ that the so-called â€œover-votesâ€ in which voters both checked and wrote in their choicesâ€™ names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the â€œunder-votesâ€ that hadnâ€™t registered on antiquated voting machines. â€œOver-votesâ€ would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on â€œclear intent of the voter.â€ 
However, instead of leading with Goreâ€™s rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. Former Vice President Al Gore. (Photo credit: algore.com) 
On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Goreâ€™s victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for â€œthe good of the country,â€ much as Johnsonâ€™s team had done in 1968 regarding Nixonâ€™s sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltonâ€™s inquiry had done regarding the 1980 â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ case. 
Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnâ€™t accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom. 
However, this violation of objective and professional journalism â€“ bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle â€“ was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future. 
By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000 â€“ even if the mediaâ€™s motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks â€“ the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ Goreâ€™s Victory ,â€ â€œ So Bush Did Steal the White House ,â€ and â€œ Bush v. Goreâ€™s Dark American Decade. â€] 
A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus 
Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the â€œstolenâ€ elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful â€œlosersâ€ are patted on the back for not complaining that the votersâ€™ will had been ignored or twisted. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. 
Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Courtâ€™s majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bushâ€™s â€œlegitimacy.â€ 
Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern â€œwise man,â€ in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnâ€™t ruffle too many feathers. 
But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies â€“ uttered for â€œthe good of the countryâ€ â€“ is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. 
So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnâ€™t pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
Trumpâ€™s complaints about â€œriggedâ€ elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they donâ€™t succeed at â€œstealingâ€ the election from white people. 
There is a racist undertone to Trumpâ€™s version of a â€œriggedâ€ democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. Heâ€™s just not honest about what those flaws are. 
The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracyâ€™s â€œgold standardâ€; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.

21336,Last Stand for ISIS?,Eric Margolis,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
As a former soldier and war correspondent who has covered 14 conflicts, I look at all the media hoopla over tightening siege of Mosul, Iraq and shake my head. This western-organized â€œliberationâ€ of Mosul is one of the bigger pieces of political-military theater that Iâ€™ve seen. 
Islamic State(IS), the defender of Mosul, is a paper tiger, blown out of all proportion by western media. IS is, as this writer has been saying for years, an armed mob made up of 20-something malcontents, religious fanatics, and modern-day anarchists. At its top is a cadre of former Iraqi Army officers with military experience. 
These former officers of Saddam Hussain are bent on revenge for the US destruction of their nation and the lynching of its late leader. But IS rank and file has no military training, little discipline, degraded communications, and ragged logistics. 
In fact, todayâ€™s Islamic State is what the Ottoman Empire used to term, â€˜bashi-bazouks,â€ a collection of irregular cut-throats and scum of the gutter sent to punish and terrorize enemies by means of torture, rapine, looting and arson. 
What has amazed me about the faux western war against ISIS is its leisurely nature, lack of Ã©lan, and hesitancy. In my view, ISIS was mostly created by the US and its allies as a weapon to be used against Syriaâ€™s government â€“ just as the Afghan mujahadin were used by the US and the Saudis to overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Israel tried the same tactics by helping create Hamas in Palestine and Hezbullah in Lebanon. Both were cultivated to split the PLO. 
ISIS is an ad hoc movement that wants to punish the West and the Saudis for the gross carnage they have inflicted on the Arab world. 
Western and Kudish auxiliary forces have been sitting 1.5 hours drive from Mosul and the IS town of Raqqa for over a year. Instead, western â€“ mainly US â€“ warplanes have been gingerly bombing around these targets in what may be an effort to convince breakaway ISIS to rejoin US-led forces fight the Damascus regime. 
Note that ISIS does not appear to have ever attacked Israel though it is playing an important role in the destruction of Syria. Some reports say Israel is providing logistic and medical support for IS. 
The siege of Mosul is being played up by western media as a heroic second Stalingrad. Donâ€™t be fooled. IS has only 3-5,000 lightly armed fighters in Mosul and Raqqa, maybe even less. The leaders of IS are likely long gone. IS has few heavy weapons, no air cover at all, and poor communications. Its rag-tag fighters will run out of ammunitions and explosives very quickly. 
Encircling Mosul are at least 50,000 western-led soldiers, backed by heavy artillery, rocket batteries, tanks, armored vehicles and awesome air power 
The western imperial forces are composed of tough Kurdish pasha merga fighters, Iraqi army and special forces, some Syrian Kurds, Iranian â€˜volunteersâ€™ irregular forces and at least 5,000 US combat troops called â€œadvisorsâ€, plus small numbers of French, Canadian and British special forces. Hovering in the background are some thousands of Turkish troops, supported by armor and artillery ready to â€˜liberateâ€™ Iraq â€“ which was once part of the Ottoman Empire. 
For the US, current military operations in Syria and Iraq are the realization of an imperialistâ€™s fondest dream: native troops led by white officers, the model of the old British Indian Raj. Washington arms, trained, equips and financed all its native auxiliaries. 
The IS is caught in a dangerous dilemma. To be a political movement, it was delighted to control Iraqâ€™s second largest city. But as a guerilla force, it should not have holed up in an urban area where it was highly vulnerable to concentrated air attack and being surrounded. This is whatâ€™s happening right now. 
In the mostly flat Fertile Crescent with too few trees, ground forces are totally vulnerable to air power, as the recent 1967, 1973 Israel-Arab wars and 2003 Iraq wars have shown. Dispersion and guerilla tactics are the only hope for those that lack air cover. 
IS forces would best advised to disperse across the region and continue their hit-and-run attacks. Otherwise, they risk being destroyed. But being mostly bloody-minded young fanatics, IS may not heed military logic and precedent in favor of making a last stand in the ruins of Mosul and Raqqa. 
When this happens, western leaders will compete to claim authorship of the faux crusade against the paper tiger of ISIS. (Reprinted from EricMargolis.com by permission of author or representative)"
21337,"Friday Mailbag: â€˜Christian Values,â€™ the Jewish Sabbath and BuzzFeed - The New York Times",Liz Spayd with Evan Gershkovich,"Friday caps a wildly busy week, especially out of Washington. There was Donald Trumpâ€™s news conference. There was the   dossier on Trump and Russia. And then there were the confirmation hearings for the  â€™s cabinet nominations. One of the nominees, Jeff Sessions for attorney general, was described in a Times profile leading up to the hearings as having Christian values. â€œMr. Sessions,â€ the profile said, â€œoffers an uncompromising brand of conservatism that combines Christian and   values with strains of populism and a willingness to say the unpopular, or even offensive. â€ That description drew fire from several readers. The public editorâ€™s take: I contacted the writers, Sharon LaFraniere and Matt Apuzzo, to ask about their intent. Both wanted to assure readers that they were not trying to use Christian values as a   for any specific policies. They also said they werenâ€™t trying to assert whether he lives a good Christian life, only that he is a devout Methodist who views his religion a guiding factor. Seems reasonable. I do appreciate, however, that the phrase used in this way could be seen as equating Sessionsâ€™ views to those of all Christians. It implies a universality to â€œChristian valuesâ€ in a way that might offend Christians who donâ€™t share them.  Also in the news this week was that unsubstantiated Trump dossier. We, of course, received a number of emails on the topic, and this office has been looking into it. Hereâ€™s one common reader complaint. The public editorâ€™s take: It sounds as if you came upon a rare link here to the BuzzFeed article. Iâ€™m told that Times staffers were given clear instructions not to link to it, but it appears one article briefly did so. Given how much of a point The Times made about the dossier being unsubstantiated, it would have been having it both ways to refuse to publish the documents but then link to BuzzFeed.  Another reader pointed out that while The Times emphasized that the claims in the dossier were unsubstantiated, it did not go to such lengths in covering Hillary Clintonâ€™s scandals during the presidential election. This week Trump also decided to give his    Jared Kushner, a place in his government as a senior White House adviser. The Times covered the decision thoroughly, giving readers a better view into the manâ€™s background. But some readers took issue with his religion being noted often, including in a story noting that Trump and his advisers, a group that included Kushner, had met on a Saturday even though Kushner typically observes the Sabbath strictly. The public editorâ€™s take: The Times guidelines say such references to religion should be used when relevant to the news. In this case, Trump often cites Kushnerâ€™s relationships with Israel and his Jewish faith as reasons he would be effective in dealing with Middle East issues. As to Kushner meeting on the Sabbath, the senior editor for standards, Greg Brock, notes that The Times offered similar explanations when Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was running for president.  Brock also said, â€œI can see why a reporter or editor might have included the reference to Kushnerâ€™s religion because it is the type of question another reader might very well ask: Why is Kushner attending meetings and not observing the Sabbath? I donâ€™t know that the reference was necessary, but mentioning it seems legitimate. â€ The public editorâ€™s take: I agree with Brock. When relevant yes, but thatâ€™s not a license to do it without context.  Another reader flagged what he thought was a conflict between the business and news side. Kinsey Wilson, executive vice president for product and technology, gave a good explanation of how this happens that applies to advertising generally: Another reader pointed out that The Times accidentally quoted a spoof account in its story on London transportation strikes  â€”   and is still using the quote. A rare and refreshing reader note came in last week. The reader wrote in simply to thank Times journalists. We hope you all enjoy the long weekend."

This is the main struggle driving iO Tillett Wrightâ€™s debut memoir, â€œDarling Days. â€ Tillett Wright was raised in the bohemian East Village of the 1980s and â€™90s by Rhonna, a sometime model and   â€œglamazonâ€ who preferred spending money on dance classes rather than on bills or groceries. In this household, Tillett Wright knows love but also instability. â€œSleep doesnâ€™t happen much in the house, what with the plays and things late at night, plus Ma is in a real bad way,â€ the child observes. â€œItâ€™s like she has a night personality and a day personality. â€ Tillett Wright grows up skinny and scrappy, able to score meals off neighborhood friends, then shimmy up the side of a building to get into the apartment undetected. Born female, Tillett Wright also grows up identifying as a boy. At 6 he turns to his dad, tells him heâ€™s now a boy and, for the next eight years, dresses and passes as such, avoiding   bathrooms and locker rooms for fear of being found out. Neither parent objects to this rewriting of gender. â€œMa doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s strange that I live as a boy. Boys have all the fun, girls have tons of restraints,â€ Tillett Wright observes. But classmates bully him, with one student wrapping a hand around his neck in a stairwell to check for an Adamâ€™s apple. Tillett Wright, an L. G. B. T. activist and host of MTVâ€™s â€œSuspect,â€ now identifies as a transgender man. Itâ€™s Maâ€™s benign neglect that is at the source of Tillett Wrightâ€™s malnourishment and general malaise, yet sheâ€™s the one who fights hardest for her â€œkitty. â€ Their relationship, though later strained by brutal fights, is always close. â€œWe are some kind of twins,â€ Tillett Wright tells his mother in the letter that prefaces the memoir, â€œable to see each other in a room of closed eyes, able to hear each other in a world of silence. â€ Twins or not, as a child Tillett Wright longed for regular meals and a real bed, not the broken army cot his mother finds for him on Canal Street. He fantasizes about finding a way to live with his â€œPoppaâ€ in Europe without â€œstabbing my mother, my best friend, in the throatâ€ by ratting her out to a school counselor. The emotional heart of the book lives within this tension  â€”   between taking care of his controlling and needy mother and taking care of himself. In this struggle, Tillett Wright is cleareyed but compassionate. â€œDarling Daysâ€ begins strong. The East Village of Tillett Wrightâ€™s childhood is especially vivid: â€œOur building repels â€˜normalâ€™ people. Theyâ€™d have to love cockroaches, scalding radiators and thin walls . â€™u2008. â€™u2008. they would have to establish their own niche in the zoo and defend it. â€ The menagerie includes an emaciated recluse who collects pianos, a pair of retired porn stars who reign over the building and his motherâ€™s rotating cast of boyfriends â€œwith broken teeth and crooked minds. â€ But as we move further into the narrative, and deeper into the trials of Tillet Wrightâ€™s adolescence, his perspective narrows. Though passionately felt and described, his struggles can feel overdetailed theyâ€™d benefit from the insights of an older, wiser narrator. To make reference to Vivian Gornick, itâ€™s too much situation, not enough story. I sometimes wished Tillett Wright would step back from the roller coaster of new schools and, later, new lovers to give us a broader view on the changes to his city, his community and especially his fallible but fascinating parents. While he was living his life, history was also happening, and the inclusion of that history could enlarge his memoir. Nevertheless, itâ€™s hard not to root for Tillett Wright when he finally comes into his own, and especially as he finds love with women, accepting a queer identity heâ€™d long feared and resisted: â€œI donâ€™t want to wear my tragedies on my skin, in my teeth, in my walk. I want something different than what Iâ€™m inheriting, but Iâ€™m going to have to make that happen for myself. â€"
21340,$26 Billion Dollars for the Jewish Lobby: Just the Tip of the Iceberg,Staff,"30 Views Share: Pre-commentary by Dr. David Duke. An article in the Jewish Daily Forward newspaper has claimed that â€œJewish charitiesâ€ give more money to Israel than they do to education, and that this figure is of the order of $26 billion. As Professor Kevin McDonald points out in this article below, this figure is actually not even the real totalâ€”it is considerably more. As he points out, this figure does not include what is collected at synagoguesâ€”and then given to Israelâ€”each month, because synagogues, schools and seminaries are not required to file tax returns. This is of real importance for everyone who wishes to understand how the Jewish lobby in America works, and how it uses American moneyâ€”and taxpayersâ€”to keep the racist Jews-only state of Israel in business. The immense wealth of the Jewish lobby is not the product of â€œJewish ingenuityâ€â€”it is the product of active discrimination in favor of Jews by other Jewsâ€”in the educational system, the economy and in the media. Forward Study of the Jewish Charity Industry By Professor Kevin MacDonald. The $26 billion dollar figure in the title refers to the net assets of the network of explicitly Jewish charitable organizations, which puts it in the same league as a major corporation. Annual revenue is around $12-14 billion. Assuming an American Jewish population of around 6.4 million, this implies assets per capita of over $4000 and per capita annual giving of around half that. Based on an older survey indicating 2.3 persons per Jewish household, annual giving per household would be around $4600. These numbers are certainly not earth shaking, but, when broken down to particular categories, they indicate that Jewish activist organizations are indeed well funded, especially when compared to the financial resources of organizations that oppose Jewish interests (probably well under $1 million for organizations explicitly dedicated to advancing the interests of White Americans). For example, 6% of the $3.7 billion in annual donations for â€œfunctional charitiesâ€ is allocated for â€œGeneral Advocacyâ€ ($222,000,000 annually), and 38% goes to Israel-related causes ($1.4 billion annually). Advocacy presumably includes the ADL which reported revenue of over $53 million in 2012â€”enough to fund over $31 million in employee salaries (including Abe Foxman at $688,188 ) and 28 regional offices. Thatâ€™s a lot of power in opposition to European interests given the virtual non-existence of organizations explicitly dedicated to furthering European identification and interests. These numbers for donations to Jewish charity are underestimates because the IRS doesnâ€™t require synagogues to file tax returns, and the same goes for schools and seminaries. As a result, â€œthe $12 billion to $14 billion in annual revenue, the Forwardâ€™s best estimate based on tax filings, is probably billions of dollars short of the networkâ€™s actual size.â€ The other way in which such a report fails to get at the scope of financial support for Jewish ethnic activism is that it does not include organizations that are not explicitly Jewish but are supported by Jews for ethnic reasons. As Norman Podhoretz notes, Jews are the financial engine of the left, but of course the vast majority of charity for leftist causes would not appear in the Forward article because they are not explicitly Jewish organizations. A good example is the SPLC which is largely Jewish-funded but would not be considered a Jewish communal organization. (In 2012 the SPLC reported revenue of over $37 million and salaries of over $16 million.) Or consider the neocon infrastructure, such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies: All of the identifiable donors are Jews, including a host of well-known Jewish activists like Edgar M. Bronfman ($1,050,000) and Michael Steinhardt ($850,000) who co-founded the Birthright Israel program that brings Jewish young people to Israel for a dose of Jewish patriotism. The same goes for the Republicans and Democrats, where Jewish funding promotes Israel and the liberal/left values of the Jewish community (likely at least 60% of Democrat funding, and at least 40% of Republican). For example, Haim Saban has donated millions to the Democrats, and right now â€œRepublicans who are considering a run for president are courting Sheldon Adelson [who donated more than $100 million to Republicans in the last presidential election cycle] as a preliminary to everything else they must do to prove their worthiness, like kissing babies in Iowa or formulating a position on jobs.â€ And anyone with a half a brain knows that Adelsonâ€™s support begins and ends with what the candidate will do for Israel. Ditto for David Gelfandâ€™s donation of more than $100 million to the Sierra Club on condition that it adopt a view on immigration in sync with the views of the organized Jewish community. (My gloss, but itâ€™s hard to believe that his donation did not reflect the typical Jewish commitment to displacement-level immigration). In other words, a lot of the most destructive Jewish funding is not included in these figures. And even though the donations to the explicitly Jewish organizations covered by the article are only the tip of the iceberg, there is no suggestion that the Jewish community is highly mobilized at this time, as indicated by the per capita data. A crisis in Israel would lead to a huge upsurge of Jewish funding, as it did during the 1967 and 1973 wars â€” as would any indication that European Americans are beginning to develop a sense of racial identity and beginning to assert their interests by developing explicitly European organizations which have the wherewithal to make a difference."
21341,Hannity: FBI Knows They Are About to Be Exposed By WikiLeaks | EndingFed News Network,nan,"Email Print Sean Hannity said on his radio show Friday that he doesnâ€™t believe reports from â€˜The New York Timesâ€™ that the FBIâ€™s latest investigation into the Clinton Foundation is related to Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner. Instead, Hannity suspects that the FBI is protecting itself because they know that WikiLeaks is about to drop proof that Hillary Clinton should have been indicted in July. 
SEAN HANNITY: If you believe The New York Times, they have a new story that just broke. â€œNew emails in Clinton case came from Anthony Weinerâ€™s electronic devices. Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that new emails uncovered in closed investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server discovered after the FBI seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, and aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI told Congress that uncovered new emails.â€ 
Let me tell you how. I am going to say something that I know is true. This story is total bull. I donâ€™t believe this for a minute. â€œHannity, itâ€™s The New York Times.â€ I have no doubt the New York Times got on-the-record leaks that this is related to Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedinâ€™s emails. I have no doubt â€” maybe Huma didnâ€™t take a sledgehammer to her devices the way Hillary Clinton did. But this is not what resulted in the reopening of this case. No way, shape, manner, or form. They know Julian Assange â€” thereâ€™s too much in WikiLeaks that is coming, that has tipped them off that theyâ€™re dead. That theyâ€™re about to be exposed. And that is, more than anything else, this is about preservation now. 
Because James Comey, and and now we get back toâ€¦ this this sky Andrew McCabe who was the FBI deputy director supervising the investigation of Clinton not long after Terry McAuliffe through a PAC gave $675,000 dollars to Jo McCabe, the wife of the chief the FBI deputy Director looking into the investigation into Clinton for a long shot bid, and that $675,000 came from Hillary, who went out there and raise money for the Super PACs that McAuliffe coudl give it to her. 
The wife of the guy doing the key investigation here. Now if that doesnâ€™t impress you, I donâ€™t know what does.. 
Now letâ€™s go back to Trey Gowdy grilling James Comey. What did he say? 
Secretary Clinton said she never sent or received classified information over a private email server, is that true? â€œComey: Our investigation found there was classified information sent.â€ 
Stop right there. Comey is admitting a crime is committed. That raises the question why did Comey then make a determination on his own not to send this to or grand jury or special prosecutor or anybody else? In other words, the statute requires, she doesnâ€™t even have to be negligent. Iâ€™m sorry the statute requires negligence or gross negligence, yet Hillary was knowingly, purposefully, and WikiLeaks proves this, in her decisions and actions setting up a server under her control. 
Hereâ€™s the question Comey has to ask: Why did you give all these people immunity?Why did you destroy evidence in the case as part of a proffered deal, why in under any circumstances do you close this case down when the evidence was overwhelming and incontrovertible and had sent numerous other people to jail for a far lesser offenses? Thatâ€™s called a two-tiered Justice system, thatâ€™s a problemâ€¦ 
Hillary knowingly and purposely hurt decisions and actions set up a server under her exclusive control and possession in order to control (violate the law) in ordered to control information that was available to the American public and Congress regarding actions as Secretary of State. 
Furthermore, she took those government-owned communications into our own personal possession after leaving her position, knowingly and willingly attempted to destroy them, by the way thatâ€™s obstruction of justice, violation of the law, penalty of which a minor offenses you never get a government position for the rest of your life. And was so nefarious in her actions, could never be known used as evidenceâ€¦ 
This gets more curious day by day. Now there were reports out today that FBI agents were reportedly close to revolting over the treatment of Clinton, theyâ€™re so disgusted, and every FBI special agent I know â€¦ nobody has a good answer because they donâ€™t understand why organizes pretty deep 
New emails tied to discoveredâ€“ I donâ€™t believe the New York Times, and I think the the FBI did this because they know what is coming. Thatâ€™s my take. Stay connected by subscribing to our news letter. Click on the button. "
21342,How World War III Could Start,Doug Diamond,"Source: ConsortiumNews.com 
The U.S. acts as if its military has an inalienable right to operate close to the borders of other nations and those nations have no right to see these actions as provocative, writes Jonathan Marshall. 
If humanity ever suffers a Third World War, chances are good it will start in some locale distant from the United States like the Baltic or South China Seas, the Persian Gulf, or Syria, where Washington and its rivals play daily games of â€œchickenâ€ with lethal air and naval forces. 
Far from enhancing U.S. security, the aggressive deployment of U.S. armed forces in these and other hot spots around the world may be putting our very survival at risk by continuously testing and prodding other military powers. What our military gains from forward deployment, training exercises, and better intelligence may be more than offset by the unnecessary provocation of hostile responses that could escalate into uncontrollable conflicts. 
The most obvious example is Russia, which top Pentagon officials like to remind us â€œposes an existential threat to the United Statesâ€ by virtue of its huge nuclear arsenal. So it was discomforting to learn a few days ago that U.S. and Russian warplanes are experiencing near misses in Syrian airspace â€œonce every 10 days-ish,â€ in the words of Air Force Lt. Gen. Jeff Harrigian. 
The risk of war with Russia would skyrocket , of course, if the United States were to try to impose a â€œno-fly-zone.â€ 
Potentially deadly incidents arenâ€™t confined to Syria. In September , a Russian fighter jet flew within 10 feet of a U.S. Navy spy plane over the Black Sea. Six months ago, reacting to an increase in NATO war games and maneuvers, Russian aircraft buzzed a U.S. Navy destroyer conducting exercises with Poland in the Baltic Sea. 
Secretary of State John Kerry declared that the United States would have had every right to shoot down the plane. The Russians, noting that the exercises were taking place near the base of their Baltic Fleet, insisted they were simply exercising their rights to fly. 
A couple of days later, a Russian jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in the same region. A Pentagon spokesman condemned the Russian pilotâ€™s â€œaggressiveâ€ and â€œunprofessionalâ€ maneuvers that could â€œescalate tensions between countries.â€ A Russian spokesman said its air defense forces had reacted prudently to â€œan unidentified target rapidly approaching the Russian border.â€ 
Indignant over Iran 
In the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy recorded 19 dangerous confrontations with Iranian vessels during the first half of this year, up from 10 in the same period in 2015. Another 11 such confrontations reportedly took place this July and August. Iranâ€™s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei speaks to a crowd. (Iranian government photo) 
The most notorious incident, of course, occurred this January, when Iranian gunboats detained 10 U.S. Navy sailors for a day after they strayed into Iranian waters. The Obama administration, which had recently negotiated a nuclear accord with Iran, chose not to inflate the incident. In contrast, a trivial engagement between a U.S. Navy vessel and unarmed Iranian patrol boats in January 2008 fired up President George W. Bush and came perilously close to triggering another Tonkin Gulf Incident. 
Although Iran is not a nuclear power, it could be a regional menace if drawn into war, with ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel and Saudi oil fields, and mines that could make the Persian Gulf virtually impassable. 
U.S. air and naval forces also engage in dangerous confrontations every few months with China, a nuclear state and the worldâ€™s fastest-rising conventional military power. 
In late October, Chinaâ€™s Defense Ministry protested an allegedly â€œillegalâ€ and â€œintentionally provocativeâ€ patrol by the guided missile destroyer USS Decatur, which was sailing close to the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea to protest Chinese maritime claims. The Chinese vowed to increase their own air and maritime patrols to â€œresolutely defend national sovereignty and security.â€ 
This summer, in the space of less than a month, Chinese fighter jets twice intercepted U.S. Air Force RC-135 spy planes off of Chinaâ€™s coast. The Pentagon decried the Chinese response as dangerously â€œunsafe,â€ while the Chinese complained that U.S. insistence on carrying out â€œclose reconnaissance activities against China . . . severely undermines Chinaâ€™s maritime security.â€ 
Similar confrontations and now commonplace . They offer frightening reminders of the infamous 2001 Hainan Incident, which was triggered when two Chinese fighter jets intercepted a Navy EP-3 spy plane operating near the Paracel Islands and Hainan Island. One Chinese pilot maneuvered too close to the American plane and died when his cockpit was crushed. The damaged EP-3 and its crew managed to make an unauthorized emergency landing on Hainan. The George W. Bush administration brought the crew â€” but not the spy plane â€” home only after sending a letter of regret to defuse the international incident. 
As geopolitical analyst Michael Moran observed at the time, â€œThe drama of this aerial collision underscores an important and little-known post-Cold War reality: Americaâ€™s surveillance network has grown so vast and formidable that in some respects it is feared as much as U.S. weaponry itself.â€ 
Trouble with Aerial Spying 
Of course, aerial spying first became a cause celÃ¨bre during the Cold War when the Soviets shot down Gary Powers and his U-2 spy plane in 1960. The resulting diplomatic crisis derailed a promising international summit on nuclear disarmament. Since then, the tempo of spy flights has dramatically increased , despite the availability of satellites to monitor the world. 
â€œOn any given day, there are more than a dozen â€˜strategicâ€™ reconnaissance flights, supplemented by dozens of shorter range missions by tactical listening aircraft and helicopters,â€ reported William Arkin after the Hainan Incident. 
Unlike satellites, intrusive planes trigger their targetsâ€™ radar systems, light up their communications networks, and provoke military command responses. Thatâ€™s why American military leaders value the tactical intelligence they provide. Thatâ€™s also why countries like China view them with such hostility. 
The spy flight that triggered the Hainan Incident cost only one life, but history shows the risks can be far greater, especially during times of great political tension. 
For example, U.S. spy flights along the Soviet Unionâ€™s eastern border helped provoke the tragic downing of a Korean Air Lines passenger jet in September 1983, when it strayed into sensitive Soviet airspace over military facilities in the Far East. The loss of 269 lives was terrible enough, but the resulting propaganda barrage from the Reagan administration helped arouse fears in the Kremlin into that war with the United States might be imminent. 
The two jittery superpowers came dangerously close to nuclear war later that month when Soviet early warning systems falsely reported the launch of U.S. Minuteman missiles. 
Military professionals in the United States and many of its rivals generally contain these incidents rather than letting them get out of hand. But accidents, miscalculations, and political opportunism pose ever-present risks of escalating small engagements into much larger military confrontations. 
Thereâ€™s plenty of blame to go around. But at the end of the day, whatâ€™s striking is that virtually every one of these dangerous incidents takes place as a result of U.S. military patrols or exercises near the borders of countries with whom we are ostensibly at peace, not while defending our own borders. 
Americans raised on a pervasive ideology of â€œexceptionalismâ€ all too easily assume that our far-flung military presence is simply the natural order of things, and that any challenge to it must be countered. A little reflection, however, should suggest why countries â€” like Russia, China and Iran â€” grow hostile and even paranoid as they are tested almost daily by the air and naval forces of a superpower. Even if we do not appreciate their point of view, we should seriously ask whether our military really serves U.S. security interests by provoking new opportunities for deadly confrontations almost daily."
21343,"Wikileaksâ€™ Julian Assange at Embassy Balcony: â€™I Will Not Forgive And Forgetâ€™, Criticises CIA and European Union",Oliver JJ Lane,"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange appeared on the Ecuadorian embassy balcony Friday afternoon after Sweden announced they were dropping the investigation into alleged rapes. [Calling todayâ€™s development an â€œimportant victoryâ€ Mr Assange, 45, who has been claiming political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy since 2012 to escape extradition to the United States where he faces accusations of espionage, slammed the â€œterrible injusticeâ€ that led to his incarceration, and the European Union for creating the situation that allowed it to develop.  Speaking to journalists from the balcony, Mr Assange said: â€œSeven years without charge, while my children grew up without me. That is not something I can forgive, it is not something I can forget. â€œThe inevitable enquiry into what has occurred in this moment of terrible injustice is something that I hope will be just about me and this situation. Because the reality is, detention and extradition without charge has become a feature of the European Union. A feature that has been exploited, yes, in my case, for political reasons, but in other cases has subjected many people to terrible injusticeâ€. Criticising the developing practice of detention without trial and the   arrest warrant, to which the United Kingdom is no longer party, Mr Assange continued: â€œIn Sweden, indefinite detention is policy. There is no time limited someone can be detained without charge. â€œThis is now how we expect a civilised state to behave. Similarly, extradition without charge is not something we expect from the rule of law in the United Kingdom. It is a measure that was introduced as part of the European Union system to turn the EU into a federationâ€. Acknowledging that he still faces arrest by the UK for breaking bail and failing to surrender himself to court while in the embassy, he continued: â€œThe UK has said it will arrest me regardless. â€œThe United States, CIA director Pompeo and the US attorney general have said I and other Wikileaks staff have no rights, no first amendment rights, and our arrest is a priority. Thatâ€™s not acceptable  â€¦     My legal staff have contacted the UK authorities and we have to engage in a dialogue about what is the best way forward. â€œTo some extent, the UK has been exploited by the processes from the European Union where it agreed to extradite people without charge. A forced position the UK has been put into and the first part of that is overâ€. Mr Assange said despite the threats against him the work of Wikileaks would continue, and the pace of leaks published targeting the United Statesâ€™ CIA organisation would intensify. He also hailed the release of â€œChelsea Manningâ€ a U. S. Army soldier and intelligence analyst who was incarcerated at a military prison for leaking cables to Wikileaks. Assange called the release a â€œvery important victoryâ€ remarking â€œwe and others have managed to have him released 28 years early from his sentenceâ€.    "
21344,3 More Reported Held in Bastille Day Truck Attack in Nice - The New York Times,Aurelien Breeden,"PARIS  â€”   France, still reeling from the attack on Thursday in the southern coastal city of Nice that killed 84 people, observed its second of three days of national mourning on Sunday, as the French police held three more people in connection with the assault, according to news reports. The nation has been left wondering whether the attack, in which a Tunisian man plowed a   refrigerated truck through crowds gathered for fireworks on Bastille Day, could have been avoided  â€”   or whether it must adjust to a harsh new reality. On Saturday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault, calling the driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, its â€œsoldier. â€ But no evidence has emerged so far that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, a delivery truck driver living in Nice, was in contact with the Islamic State, or that he was exposed to its propaganda. A man and a woman were arrested Sunday morning, French news media reported, and another man was detained later on Sunday, according to Agence  . None were identified, although some reports said that the man and woman were an Albanian couple, and that the man was suspected of providing Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel with the automatic pistol he used on the night of the attack. Four other people had been taken in for questioning on Friday and Saturday. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlelâ€™s estranged wife, who had also been taken in for questioning, was released without charges on Sunday. Her lawyer,   Garino, told the BFM TV news channel that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel was physically violent with her and other members of the family. She eventually threw him out and was no longer in touch with him, Mr. Garino added. Although they have not put forth specific evidence, French officials say Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel appeared to have taken the path to extremism very shortly before the attack. In an interview published on Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said the kind of terrorism seen in Nice was â€œhard to anticipate,â€ noting that the killer had â€œradicalized very quickly. â€ â€œDaesh provides unbalanced individuals with an ideological kit that gives their acts meaning,â€ Mr. Valls said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. â€œThe investigation will have to prove it, but that was probably the case for the attack in Nice. â€ There were reports on Sunday that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel had spent time researching his route on the waterfront promenade where the attack unfolded, as he was caught on surveillance cameras driving the truck in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday. Agence   and other French news media, quoting anonymous police officials, also reported on Sunday that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel had sent a text message shortly before the attack in which he appeared to ask for more weapons, but it was unclear whom the message had been for and what exactly it had said. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel used an automatic pistol to shoot at the police officers who tried to stop him on the promenade several fake weapons were also found in his truck after he was fatally shot. On Sunday, people continued to gather in Nice and in many other French cities to hold minutes of silence or to commemorate the victims. In Paris, there was a Mass at the Cathedral of   on Sunday evening. The Paris prosecutorâ€™s office said in a statement on Sunday that 49 people hurt in the attack remained in critical condition, 18 of them fighting for their lives. The total number of injured was 256, down from a figure provided on Saturday by the Health Ministry. The prosecutorâ€™s office also said that the French authorities had sped up the process to identify the dead, but that only 35 had been formally identified so far. At least 10 children were killed and 35 hurt. Families and tourists had gathered on the waterfront on Thursday evening to watch fireworks celebrating Bastille Day."

21347,Trump Sealed Carrier Deal With Mix of Threat and Incentive - The New York Times,Nelson D. Schwartz,"INDIANAPOLIS  â€”   The   call from Donald J. Trump to the heating and cooling giant Carrier came early one morning about a week after the election, when he unexpectedly won the industrial heartland. The   warned Gregory Hayes, the chief executive of Carrierâ€™s parent, United Technologies, that he had to find a way to save a substantial share of the jobs it had vowed to move to Mexico, or he would face the wrath of the incoming administration. On Thursday, as he toured the factory floor here to take credit for saving roughly half of the 2, 000 jobs Indiana stood to lose, Mr. Trump sent a message to other businesses as well that he intended to follow through on his pledges to impose stiff tariffs on imports from companies that move production overseas and ship their products back to the United States. â€œThis is the way itâ€™s going to be,â€ Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times. â€œCorporate America is going to have to understand that we have to take care of our workers also. â€ Mr. Trump was accompanied by his vice   Mike Pence, who is currently Indianaâ€™s governor. He was in the room at Trump Tower when the   placed his initial call to Mr. Hayes, and he was the one who sealed the deal with the chief executive with a handshake in the building on Monday. â€œI donâ€™t want them moving out of the country without consequences,â€ Mr. Trump said, even if that means angering the    Republicans he beat in the primaries but will have to work with on Capitol Hill. â€œThe free market has been sorting it out and Americaâ€™s been losing,â€ Mr. Pence added, as Mr. Trump interjected, â€œEvery time, every time. â€ But since the pact was disclosed on Tuesday, critics have pounced on Carrierâ€™s receipt of $7 million in incentives from the state of Indiana  â€”   just the kind of corporate giveaways Mr. Trump knocked as he slammed Carrier on the campaign trail last spring. Others have pointed out that cutting individual deals with different companies is a costly and ineffective way to stem the powerful forces that impel business to move factories and jobs in a highly competitive global and national economy. â€œHe has signaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for   tax benefits and incentives,â€ Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote in an   on Thursday for The Washington Post. In Washington, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, suggested that Carrierâ€™s decision, while â€œgood news,â€ was only a drop in the bucket. â€œMr. Trump would have to make 804 more announcements just like that to equal the standard of jobs in the manufacturing sector that were created in this country under President Obamaâ€™s watch,â€ Mr. Earnest said. â€œSo this is good news, but the incoming president has a high bar to meet when it comes to putting in place the kind of economic policies that would benefit American workers. â€ Still, Mr. Trumpâ€™s appeal is likely to lead to a more fundamental shift in the way Washington approaches dealing with corporate decisions on where to locate jobs. â€œContrary to early reactions from the left and the right, the Carrier deal opens the door to a new approach to U. S. economic growth policy that is sorely needed,â€ the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research and advocacy group, said in a statement. â€œIt sets the precedent that growing, attracting and retaining globally traded,   industries that are both   and pay high wages is central to U. S. economic growth. â€ Despite the cheers Mr. Trump received as he walked around the factory floor, where the lines continued to run and he had to shout at times to be heard, another 1, 000 workers for the company in Indiana will be losing their jobs. This includes 700 at a United Technologies factory in nearby Huntington, as well as several hundred here. The 800 or so jobs that are being preserved are mostly on the lines that build   and   gas furnaces. Not long after Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence departed for the airport and to another rally in Ohio to celebrate his victory, workers coming in for the night shift received a letter titled â€œCompany Update on Indianapolis Operations. â€ â€œWhile this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone,â€ the letter stated. â€œWe are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with the expected completion by the end of 2017. â€ United Technologies, Carrierâ€™s parent, saw the writing on the wall as soon as Mr. Trump declared victory last month. Offering to preserve jobs, even at the cost of some of the $65 million savings the company expected from the move, could serve its larger corporate interests. â€œEvery penny counts, but if we step back and Iâ€™m looking at earnings of $6. 60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the   listens to some of the companyâ€™s bigger concerns,â€ said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York. And Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, while providing a carrot through the state incentives and promises of future business tax cuts, held an implicit stick: the threat of pulling federal contracts from Carrierâ€™s parent, United Technologies. Mr. Trump and his team were well aware that the amount United Technologies stood to lose in those contracts dwarfed the savings from moving some of its operations to Monterrey from Indiana. Despite only accomplishing half of what had been promised in the campaign, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence predicted that the number of jobs ultimately preserved could rise as Carrier follows through on its promise to invest more than $16 million in the state. That provision, plus the incentives, were worked out between Carrier and officials from the state of Indianaâ€™s economic development office, with Mr. Pence overseeing the process. The vice   insisted that the incentives did not represent a giveaway on Mr. Trumpâ€™s part, and claimed United Technologies had turned down a   package of breaks in March. What made the difference, he said, was Mr. Trumpâ€™s public pressure, as well his promise to cut corporate taxes and ease regulation. â€œThese jobs were gone,â€ Mr. Pence said. â€œI sat the executives down in my governorâ€™s office in the statehouse in early March. They said we arenâ€™t in a position to reconsider this in any way, shape or form. â€ Mr. Trump, too, played down the role of the incentives. And he said he did not directly raise the $5 billion to $6 billion in federal contracts United Technologies receives, much of it from the Pentagon. But company officials are acutely aware that its Pratt  Whitney unit, among other things, supplies jet engines to the Air Forceâ€™s most advanced fighter and many other planes, making it much more vulnerable to political pressure than other,   manufacturers that have been steadily closing shop in the Midwest and moving production south of the border. â€œIt may have a played a role in their equation,â€ Mr. Trump allowed. â€œI never mentioned it. I didnâ€™t feel I had to. â€ What about the fact that Mr. Trump frequently sourced products for his properties overseas, along with some popular   merchandise? Will he lead by example and buy more goods made in the U. S. A.? â€œI buy thousands and thousands of TVs,â€ he said. â€œI would like to, but they essentially donâ€™t make them in the U. S. You know the hats I do? It took us forever to find a company that can make a hat in the U. S. â€"
21348,The US Threatens Irish Neutrality,stclair,"â€œWe declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible.â€
â€“Proclamation of Easter Week 1916
Controlling their own destiny has always been a bit of a preoccupation for the Irish, in large part because for 735 years someone else was in charge. From the Norman invasion in 1169 to the establishment of the Free State in 1922, Irelandâ€™s political and economic life was not its own to determine. Its young men were shipped off to fight Englandâ€™s colonial battles half a world away, at Isandlwana, Dum Dum, Omdurman and Kut. Almost 50,000 died in World War I, choking on gas at Ypres, clinging desperately to a beachhead at Gallipoli, or marching into German machine guns at the Somme.
When the Irish finally cast off their colonial yoke, they pledged never again to be cannon fodder in other nationâ€™s wars, a pledge that has now been undermined by the U.S. Once again, a powerful nationâ€”with the acquiescence of the Dublin governmentâ€”has put the Irish in harmâ€™s way.
The flashpoint for this is Shannon Airport, located in County Clare on Irelandâ€™s west coast. Since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on Washington and New York, some 2.5 million U.S. troops have passed through the airport on their way to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The Shannon hub has become so important to the U.S. that it hosts a permanent U.S. staff officer to direct traffic. It is, in the words of the peace organization Shannonwatch , â€œa US forward operating base.â€
The airport has also been tied to dozens of CIA â€œrenditionâ€ flights, where prisoners seized in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan were shipped to various â€œblack sitesâ€ in Europe, Asia, and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
Irish peace activists and members of the Irish parliament, or Oireachtas Elreann, charge that an agreement between the Irish government and Washington to allow the transiting of troops and aircraft through Shannon not only violates Irish neutrality it violates international law.
â€œThe logistical support for the U.S. military and CIA at Shannon is a contravention of Irelandâ€™s neutrality,â€ says John Lannon of the peace group Shannonwatch, and has â€œcontributed to death, torture, starvation, forced displacement and a range of other human rights abuses.â€
Ireland is not a member of NATO, and it is considered officially neutral. But â€œneutralâ€ in Ireland can be a slippery term. The government claims that Ireland is â€œmilitarily neutralâ€â€”it doesnâ€™t belong to any military alliancesâ€”but not â€œpolitically neutral.â€
But the term militarily neutral â€œdoes not exist in international law,â€ says Karen Devine, an expert on neutrality at the City of Dublinâ€™s School of Law & Government. â€œThe decision to aid belligerents in war isâ€¦incompatible with Article 2 of the Fifth Hague Convention on the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land.â€ Devine argues that â€œthe Irish governmentâ€™s decision to permit the transit of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers through Shannon Airport on their way to the Iraq War in 2003 violated international law on neutrality and set it apart from European neutrals who refused such permission.â€
Article 2 of the Convention states, â€œBelligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions or war supplies across the territory of a neutral power.â€
Ireland has not ratified the Hague Convention but according to British international law expert Iain Scobbie, the country is still bound by international law because Article 29 of the Irish Constitution states, â€œIreland accepts the generally recognized principle of international law as its rule of conduct in relations with other states.â€
The UN Security Council did not endorse the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq, making both conflicts technically illegal. Then UN General Secretary Kofi Annan said that the invasions â€œwere not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view, from the Charterâ€™s point of view,â€ the invasions were â€œillegal.â€
Shannonwatchâ€™s Lannon says the agreement also violates the 1952 Air Navigation Foreign Military Aircraft Order that requires that â€œaircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition and explosives, and must not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question must not form part of a military exercises or operations.â€
The Dublin government claims all US aircraft adhere to the 1952 order, although it refuses to inspect aircraft or allow any independent inspection. According to retired Irish Army Captain Tom Clonan, the Irish Times security analyst, the soldiers are armed but leave their weapons on board the transportsâ€”generally Hercules C-130sâ€”while they stretch their legs after the long cross Atlantic flight. Airport employees have also seen soldiers with their weapons.
The Irish government also says that it has been assured that no rendition flights have flown through Shannon, but Shannonwatch activists have tracked flights in and out of the airport. As for â€œassurances,â€ Washington â€œassuredâ€ the British government that no rendition flights used British airports, but in 2008 then Foreign Secretary Ed Miliband told Parliament that such flights did use the United Kingdom controlled island of Diego Garcia.
Investigative journalistâ€™s Mark Dannerâ€™s book Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War chronicles the grotesque nature of some of the â€œenhanced interrogationâ€ techniques inflicted on those prisoners. The rendition program violated the 1987 UN Convention Against Torture, which Ireland is a party to.
Roslyn Fuller , Dublin-based scholar and author of Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed Its Meaning And Lost Its Way , says terror suspects were taken to sites where â€œin an appalling re-run of the Spanish Inquisition tactics, [they were] routinely tortured and mistreated in an attempt to obtain confessions and other information.â€
Fuller points out that Article 11 of the Hague Convention requires that troops belonging to a â€œbelligerentâ€ army must be interned. â€œIn other words, any country that would like to call itself neutral is obligated to prevent warring parties from moving troops though its territory and to gently scoop up anyone attempting to contravene this principle.â€
Besides violating international law, Ireland is harvesting â€œthe bitter fruits of the Iraq and Afghan warsâ€ and NATOâ€™s military intervention in Libya, charges MP Richard Boyd Barrett of the People Before Profit Party and chair of the Irish Anti-War Movement. â€œThe grotesque images of children and families washed up on Europeâ€™s shores, desperate refugees, risking and losing their lives,â€ he says, â€œare the direct result of disastrous wars waged by the US, the UK and other major western powers over the last 12 years.â€
The Irish government, says Barrett, has â€œcolluded with war crimes and actions for which we are now witnessing the most terrible consequences.â€
The government has waived all traffic control costs on military flights, costing Dublin about $45 million from 2003 to 2015. Ireland is currently running one of the highest per capita debts in Europe and has applied austerity measures that have reduced pensions and severely cut social services, health programs and education. Other neutral European countries, like Finland, Austria and Switzerland charge the US military fees for using their airspace.
Shannon might also make Ireland collateral damage in the war on terror, according to the Irish Timesâ€™ Clonan. Irish citizens are now seen as a â€œhostile party,â€ and British Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary has named Shannon a â€œlegitimate target,â€ according to Irish journalist Danielle Ryan.
The Dublin government has generally avoided open discussion of the issue, and when it comes up, ministers tend to get evasive. In response to the charge that Shannon hosted rendition flights, then Minister of Foreign Affairs Dermot Ahern said, â€œIf anyone has evidence of any of these flights please give me a call and I will have it investigated.â€ But even though Amnesty International produced flights logs for 50 rendition landings at Shannon, the government did nothing. Investigations by the Council on Europe and European Parliament also confirmed rendition flights through Shannon.
Peace activists charge that attempts to raise the issue in the Irish parliament have met with a combination of stonewalling and half-truths. Apparently kissing the Blarney Stone is not just for tourists.
The governmentâ€™s position finds little support among the electorate. Depending on how the questions are asked, polls indicate that between 55 and 58 percent of the Irish oppose allowing US transports to land at Shannon, and between 57 to 76 percent want to add a neutrality clause to the constitution.
The â€œforward baseâ€ status of Shannon puts the west of Ireland in the crosshairs in the event of a war with Russia. While that might seem far-fetched, in 2015 NATO held 14 military maneuvers directed at Russia, and relations between NATO, the US and Moscow are at their lowest point since the height of the Cold War.
Of course Ireland is not alone in putting itself in harmâ€™s way. The US has more than 800 bases worldwide, bases that might well be targeted in a nuclear war with China or Russia. Local populations have little say over the construction of these bases, but they would be the first casualties in a conflict.
For centuries Ireland was colonialismâ€™s laboratory. The policies used to enchain its peopleâ€”religious division and ethnic hatredâ€” were tested out and then shipped off to India, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Guyana, and Irish soldiers populate colonial graveyards on all four continents, now, once again, Ireland has been drawn into a conflict that is has no stake in.
Not that the Irish have taken this lying down. Scores of activists have invaded Shannon to block military flights and, on occasion, to attack aircraft with axes and hammers. â€œPit stop of deathâ€ was one slogan peace demonstrators painted on a hanger at the airport.
That resistance harkens back to the 1916 Easter Rebellionâ€™s proclamation that ends with the words that ring as true today as they did a century ago: â€œIn this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valor and discipline and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.â€

21349,"In Japanâ€™s Slow Economy, Rare Price Rise Prompts Surplus of Remorse - The New York Times",Jonathan Soble,"TOKYO  â€”   One of the most   television commercials in Japan this year advertises an unusual product: contrition. The ad shows a group of workers and executives from an ice cream company lined up in neat rows in front of their suburban Tokyo factory. As gentle folk music plays, they bow in apology. The companyâ€™s transgression? Adding 10 yen, or about 9 cents, to the price of   a hugely popular   ice cream bar. About 500 million of the bright blue snacks are consumed every year, mostly by children. Increasing prices are a big deal in Japan. The countryâ€™s sluggish economy means that the cost of most things has not risen in 20 years, and almost any increase makes headlines. Consumer prices are a painful economic headache for Japan. The countryâ€™s officials have been trying to break this stubborn pattern of deflation by pumping money into the economy and bolstering public spending. Japanâ€™s economy, which has been oscillating between growth and contraction for years, picked up speed in the first quarter, according to government data released on Wednesday. But the price increases that do go through  â€”   like the cost of the   ice cream bar rising to Â¥70, from Â¥60  â€”   do not reflect a more vibrant economy or a stronger consumer. They usually mean a company is facing higher costs cutting into its profit. The deflationary trends are still firmly in place. And wages are under more pressure than prices, so buying power for most Japanese has declined compared with a generation ago. â€œ  is meant to be something kids can easily buy with their allowance,â€ said Fumio Hagiwara, a marketing executive at Akagi Nyugyo, the maker of the ice cream bar. â€œEven   have less pocket money these days. â€ Akagi last increased prices a quarter of a century ago, and it debated the recent rise for seven or eight years, Mr. Hagiwara said. The rising cost of raw materials finally forced Akagiâ€™s hand, he said. Tighter logging restrictions in China, for instance, meant it had to use more expensive Russian lumber for ice cream sticks. In stronger economic circumstances, Akagiâ€™s price increase would not stand out. Companies in other places routinely pass on higher costs to consumers. But in Japan, businesses that face rising costs feel they have less ability to do so because wages are flat. Instead, they take a hit to their profits or cut back rather than alienate consumers. â€œWe donâ€™t have any more income, but taxes are rising,â€ said Kazuko Ida, 65, who lives in Tokyo. As a result, she said, she is especially reluctant to spend more. â€œItâ€™s one thing if luxury items are expensive, but if cheap things arenâ€™t cheap anymore, itâ€™s a real problem. â€ Japanese policy makers have long identified deflation as enemy No. 1 for the economy. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won power four years ago on a promise to stamp it out. The central bank has been flooding financial markets with cheap money, and it has gone so far as to cut its benchmark interest rate below zero, a policy that has been tried in only a few other developed countries. But the results officials have been seeking  â€”   robust increases in borrowing and spending, and a sustained rise in prices  â€”   have been elusive. The Consumer Price Index is back below zero, after an upswing during Mr. Abeâ€™s first two years in office. Wholesale prices tumbled 4. 2 percent in April, their sharpest decline in more than six years. A recent rise in the value of the yen, after several years of weakness under Mr. Abe, has made beating deflation harder. A weak yen means costlier imports, which helps drive overall inflation. But now imports on the whole are getting cheaper again. The economic report on Wednesday showed that Japanâ€™s economy expanded 1. 7 percent in annualized,   terms in the quarter that ended in March. That was significantly faster than forecasts. Still, economists urged caution: Spending by households and businesses was down, and so were exports  â€”   all crucial pillars of growth. Rather than rely on those, the economy benefited from higher government spending and a decline in imports. The extra day in February because of the leap year also helped, specialists said. â€œReasons for the upside surprise were not encouraging,â€ said Masamichi Adachi, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase. He said the economy was likely to remain stagnant. Since Mr. Abeâ€™s conservative coalition was elected in December 2012, the economy has expanded in eight quarters and shrunk in five. Newspaper opinion surveys suggest that about half of voters are dissatisfied with his economic program, known as Abenomics. A disorganized political opposition has offered little in the way of alternatives, but an election for the upper house of Parliament in July is adding to pressure to turn things around. Mr. Abe is looking at ways to restore momentum. The government is drafting a supplementary stimulus budget and is considering delaying an increase in the national sales tax planned for April 2017. The two percentage point tax increase, the second of two planned rises, has already been put off once. Supporters say it is needed to reduce Japanâ€™s large budget deficit. But the first increase, in 2014, hurt consumers and was blamed for pushing the economy into recession. In the ice cream business, Mr. Hagiwara said Akagi had calculated that  â€™s sales volume would drop by 7 percent as a result of raising prices. The sales hit, the company believed, would be more than counterbalanced by the higher price. But it appears that for his company, at least, an apology is an effective way to deal with the pain. Mr. Hagiwara said sales jumped by about 10 percent in the first month or so after the price increase in March, though they have since begun to fall back. â€œWe figure it will take another year before we know how consumers really take to it,â€ he said."
21350,"Catching a Flight? Budget Hours, Not Minutes, for Security - The New York Times",Jad Mouawad,"Security lines at airports are getting longer  â€”   much longer  â€”   and wait times could reach epidemic levels when air travel peaks this summer, according to airlines, airports and federal officials. A combination of fewer Transportation Security Administration screeners, tighter budgets, new checkpoint procedures and growing numbers of passengers is already creating a mess at airports around the country. While federal security officials say they are hiring and training hundreds of additional screening officers, matters are not expected to improve anytime soon. Airline and airport officials have said they fear that the current slowdown will last through the year, and could cause a summer travel meltdown when more than 220 million passengers are expected to fly during the peak travel months of July and August. â€œThis is going to be a rough summer there is no doubt about it,â€ said Gary Rasicot, who was recently appointed to a newly created position as the T. S. A. â€™s chief of operations. â€œWe are probably not at the staffing level we would like to be to address the volume. This is why we are talking about people getting to the airport a little earlier than planned. â€ To deal with the expected crowds, Mr. Rasicot said the agency planned to assign 768 new officers to the busiest airports by June 15. The agency is also allocating an extra $26 million for overtime pay, and is looking for ways to move its   dogs where they will have the most effect on reducing wait times. Already, passengers have reported epic lines. Travelers have seen lines stretching to the curb, snaking to other terminal levels or even extending into different concourses. Some have managed to handle the situation with humor. Others have not been quite as forgiving. At Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, about 600 passengers missed their flights on March 25 because an inadequate number of screeners led to waits exceeding three hours, airport officials said. Brent D. Cagle, the airportâ€™s interim director of aviation, complained to the T. S. A. calling the episode a â€œfiasco. â€ â€œThis situation could have been avoided, had the T. S. A. had the proper staffing (or overtime budget necessary) to meet customer demand,â€ Mr. Cagle wrote in a letter to the security agency. (T. S. A. officials denied that the wait had ever been that long, telling local reporters that it had been 75 minutes for a short time.) This was far from an isolated incident. Airports in Atlanta, Miami, New York, Seattle, Denver and Chicago, among others, have all experienced similar problems in recent months. Last month, Denver Airport advised travelers to get to the airport as much as three hours before their flights. Still, people waited for more than an hour and a half to clear security. Airport workers walked up and down the line with therapy dogs and handed out bottled water and candy to travelers, according to one report. The airport accused the T. S. A. of providing an inadequate number of screeners on what was an average Saturday. T. S. A. officials say the main reason for the longer lines is an increase in the number of travelers this year. â€œWhere it starts is actually a volume issue,â€ said Mr. Rasicot, who was previously a senior official with the United States Coast Guard, as was the T. S. A. â€™s administrator, Peter V. Neffenger. â€œItâ€™s really a   story. The economy is doing well, Americans are traveling more, and this equates with record numbers at our checkpoints. â€ At the same time, he said, the number of T. S. A. screeners has declined by about 5, 800 because of tighter budgets. The agency currently has 42, 350 agents assigned for security checks. â€œWe need to stop losing people and we need to add more,â€ he said. He said some airlines were helping by assigning their own employees to perform some tasks, like helping direct passengers to the right lanes or advising them on when to take off their shoes. Still, many passengers complained that the agency seemed ill prepared to handle the crowds. Ben Cheever, a support engineer for a cybersecurity firm, recently missed a flight in Seattle despite getting to the airport two hours ahead of his 6 p. m. departure to San Diego. Two lines spilled into the airport lobby, he said. A third was reserved for passengers who had signed up to a trusted traveler program called T. S. A. PreCheck that allowed them speedier access. After 90 minutes, the T. S. A. opened a couple of extra lanes, but he still missed his flight. â€œIt was too little, too late,â€ he said. The next day, he showed up three hours ahead of time. â€œIt was the most miserable business trip Iâ€™ve ever had. â€ American Airlines said that the slower security lines had forced it to delay flights and rebook passengers who had missed connections. For instance, in a   period in   the airline said, about 6, 800 of its passengers missed their flights after being stuck in T. S. A. lines too long. â€œT. S. A. lines at checkpoints nationwide have become unacceptable,â€ said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines. â€œLines grew in January, February and March, and now in April, too. We are really concerned about what happens in the summer. â€ Another factor that lengthens wait times is that passengers are carrying more bags on board to avoid paying fees for checked luggage. But thereâ€™s not much airlines can do, except warn passengers to show up three hours before takeoff for international flights and as much as two hours ahead of their flights for domestic travel. There are other factors at play as well. Last year, the agency vowed to make changes to security and screening procedures to address widespread safety lapses that had been uncovered by the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s inspector general. The audit found that agents had failed to spot weapons and explosives in 95 percent of the undercover tests. The findings prompted criticism by some former and current T. S. A. employees, who claimed that the agency was keen to keep passengers moving quickly through the lines. In response, the T. S. A. stopped randomly processing some passengers who had not enrolled in a prescreening program to go through its expedited PreCheck lanes. It eliminated a program known as Managed Inclusion II, which let officers trained in behavior detection direct some passengers through the faster PreCheck lanes after checking them for explosives using trace detection samplings. Now, T. S. A. agents send unvetted passengers through the PreCheck lanes only if they have been checked by   dogs while waiting in line. (That policy is called Managed Inclusion I.) Meanwhile, T. S. A. agents have been finding record numbers of guns and other weapons that passengers are barred from carrying on the plane. Both the airlines and the T. S. A. said that one way to alleviate the longer wait is to sign up for PreCheck, which allows eligible passengers to go through the speedier lanes without having to take off their shoes and belts or remove laptops and other electronic devices from their bags. So far, seven million people have enrolled in one of several trusted traveler programs, including 2. 5 million in the T. S. A. PreCheck program and 2. 5 million in Global Entry, a program run by Customs and Border Protection. There is an $85 application fee for the T. S. A. program, and a $100 fee for Global Entry. Both are valid for five years. The T. S. A. has added more PreCheck lanes, but the number of people enrolled still falls well short of the 25 million the T. S. A. would like to sign up. Even passengers with PreCheck have had close calls. Anne Marie Harrison, a wine saleswoman who has signed up for PreCheck and who flies out of Newark Liberty International Airport about twice a month, said she nearly missed her flight after waiting more than an hour recently. That day, the security line started downstairs, in the baggage   area. That was odd, she said, especially for a Sunday morning when the airport was usually empty. â€œSomething needs to be done,â€ she said. â€œIt is just crazy. â€ Still, not everyone is complaining."
21351,3 States Approve Recreational Marijuana; Nationwide Is Next,Lance Schuttler,"3 States Approve Recreational Marijuana; Nationwide Is Next Nov 9, 2016 2 0 
As we reported last night , three states have approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, which includes California, Nevada and Massachusetts. As of the morning of November 9th, Maine is reportedly close to also approving the legalization, with 91% of the votes counted and a â€œyesâ€ vote currently being the favorite. 
In addition to the three and possibly four states legalizing recreational use of marijuana, three states have approved the legalization of medical marijuana, which includes Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota. Marijuana States of America 
With California, Massachusetts and Nevada and possibly Maine approving recreational marijuana, they join Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska as states who have already approved the same laws. 
With this in mind, we now have 7 states having approved the full legalization of marijuana. What is now to stop the rest of the country? Most likely nothing. There is a saying that â€œas California goes, so goes the nation.â€ 
California has led the way in marijuana laws for the past 20 years and this latest step is yet another sign that the nation is quickly heading in the same direction. Undoubtedly, this will be a big topic for many legislators in the days and weeks to come. With 7 states now approved for recreational use, the people have gained even more leverage in the push for a nationwide approval. 
The arguments for those against be facing a tough situation as it will soon be very well known that a full 7 states have approved this measure, with many others with medical approval. Times are quickly changing. 
Many see this as a positive sign in the awakening of humanity for a couple different reasons. 
First is that marijuana has been reported by millions to have helped them to â€œwake upâ€ and see through different distractions and illusions that society has put forth, through education, media, the medical system and politics itself. To some, this is direct evidence that the Elite has lost control and that the global awakening of humanity is spreading even quicker now. 
The other reason is that this will now allow for an even greater push for the legalization of industrial hemp to be grown in all 50 states once again. As many know, hemp is an excellent resource which can be made into clothing, food, medicine, shelter and many other things, as well as create new jobs. 
Even the Establishment sees the writing on the wall. In a recent interview with Bill Maher , President Obama said that passage of the legalization measures on Tuesday could make the current federal approach to the drug â€œuntenable.â€ In other words, what has just happened has made nationwide legalization unstoppable.

21352,"EXCLUSIVE: Carnival Corporationâ€™s Alleged Outsourcing Plan Sends Jobs to India, Europe",John Binder,"Carnival Corporation, with the help of an outsourcing firm, is set to offshore hundreds of American jobs overseas to India and Eastern Europe, according to an alleged leaked  document obtained by Breitbart Texas. [The document depicts a map showing the American positions which the company will purportedly outsource to two foreign regions, leaving hundreds of American workers jobless.  Positions listed as moving from the U. S. to India, according to the alleged internal document, include a mix of high and   jobs involving: Meanwhile the jobs allegedly being offshored to Poland and Romania include: The only jobs listed to be allegedly remaining in the U. S. within the companyâ€™s IT department involve account, operational, and compliance management and   support, among others. A source close to Breitbart Texas said earlier this year in February, Carnival Corporation began executing the outsourcing plan led by Capgemini, telling Americans to either take jobs with the outsourcing firm and risk being fired six months later or leave the company altogether. Carnival Corporation teamed up with Capgemini, a French outsourcing firm, to allegedly mass   the American IT workers remaining at the company who had yet to be replaced by cheaper, foreign workers. In a statement to Breitbart Texas regarding the allegations of offshoring, Carnival Corporation Spokesman Roger Frizzell said: This is a relatively small group of employees within the company  â€”   roughly 130 people within our IT organization  â€”   that moved over several months ago to Capgemini, which has offices in Miami and throughout the U. S. A vast majority of these individuals  â€”   100 or so  â€”   will continue in their existing IT roles to support Carnival Corporation at their existing Carnival office locations (and existing salaries). Discussions are underway with the remaining 30 employees, who are being considered for other positions in the U. S. within Capgemini. It also important to note that every Carnival employee within this IT group was offered employment several months ago with Capgemini as they evaluated the needs of our business. As I mentioned, more than 100 of these individuals are continuing in their existing roles in support of Carnival Corporation in the same Carnival Corporation office location.   â€¦     Based on the latest update from Capgemini, it looks as if they are optimistic that new positions and opportunities will be found for the other 30 employees. A source familiar with Carnivalâ€™s alleged outsourcing plan said they â€œdoubtedâ€ the companyâ€™s claim that only 130 employees were impacted by the changes, saying at the original group of employees impacted was likely closer to about 250. â€œWe were forced to take the Capgemini jobs,â€ the source told Breitbart Texas. â€œThey forced me into Capgemini and because I didnâ€™t take it, they said I resigned, but I didnâ€™t. I wasnâ€™t given a choice. â€ The source also said that although many employees did take jobs at Capgemini originally, some eventually left their new positions because they understood that their job would eventually be   overseas. Capgemini, like other outsourcing firms such as Infosys and Tata Consulting, is known for contracting with major U. S. corporations to replace Americans through the   visa. After they are replaced with   foreign workers, the jobs are eventually offshored altogether. As reported by Breitbart Texas, domestic companies have been able to get away with importing   foreign workers by hiding   visa applications behind the outsourcing firms they partner with. In Carnival Corporationâ€™s case, the company has the potential to deny any such offshoring and   of Americans, as Capgemini is technically handling the operation.

21353,11 very depressing economic realities that Donald Trump will inherit,Michael Snyder,"11 very depressing economic realities that Donald Trump will inherit There will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo By Michael Snyder - Friday, November 18, 2016 9:16 AM EST 
It would be a grave mistake to understate the amount of damage that has been done to the U.S. economy over the past eight years. In this article, I am going to share some economic numbers with you that are extremely sobering. Anyone that takes a cold, hard, honest look at the numbers should be able to see that our economy is in terrible shape. Unfortunately, the way that we see things is often clouded by our political views. Up until the election, Democrats were far more likely then Republicans to believe that the economy was improving, but now that is in the process of completely reversing. According to Gallup , only 16 percent of Republicans believed that the economy was getting better before the election, but that number has suddenly jumped to 49 percent after Trumpâ€™s election victory. And the percentage of Democrats that believe that the economy is getting better fell from 61 percent to 46 percent after the election. Here are some additional details from Gallup â€¦ After Trump won last weekâ€™s election, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U.S. economyâ€™s outlook than they did before the election. Just 16% of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81% said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49% say it is getting better and 44% worse. Conversely, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independentsâ€™ confidence in the economy plummeted after the election. Before the election, 61% of Democrats said the economy was getting better and 35% worse. Now, Democrats are evenly divided, with 46% saying it is getting better and 47% saying it is getting worse. 
The truth, of course, is that the result of the election did not somehow magically alter the outlook for the U.S. economy. 
We still have a giant mess on our hands, and the following are 11 very depressing economic realities that Donald Trump will inherit from Barack Obamaâ€¦ 
#1 Nearly 7 out of every 10 Americans have less than $1,000 in savings . That means that about two-thirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment. 
#2 Reuters is reporting that U.S. mall investors are poised to lose â€œbillionsâ€ of dollars as the â€œ retail apocalypse â€ in this nation deepens. 
#3 Credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since 2012 . 
#4 Approximately 35 percent of all Americans have a debt that is at least 180 days past due. 
#5 The rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a 50 year low . 
#6 The total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost 10 million . 
#7 The number of homeless people in New York City (where Donald Trump is from) has hit a brand new record high . 
#8 About 20 percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents . 
#9 Total household debt in the United States has now reached a grand total of 12.3 trillion dollars . 
#10 The total amount of corporate debt in the U.S. has nearly doubled since the end of 2007. 
#11 When Barack Obama entered the White House, the U.S. government was 10.6 trillion dollars in debt. Today, the U.S. national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of $19,842,173,949,869.58 . 
Despite nearly doubling the national debt during his eight years in the White House, Barack Obama is going to be the only president in United States history to never have a single year when U.S. GDP grew by at least three percent. 
So will Donald Trump waltz in and suddenly turn everything around? 
Just like when George W. Bush was elected, there is a lot of optimism about the future right now among Republicans. 
And in 2017, Republicans are going to have control of the Senate and the House in addition to being in control of the White House. 
But does that mean that they will actually get anything done? 
For a moment, letâ€™s review what didnâ€™t happen the last time the Republicans were in this position. The following is an extended excerpt from an article by author Devvy Kidd â€¦ â€”â€“ The Republicans had control of both houses of Congress part of the time during Bush, Jr.â€™s two terms. Did they lock down our borders? NO. Did they pass legislation to stop ALL funding for illegals which would self-deport millions of liars, cheats and thieves? NO. (READ, please: How to Self-Deport Millions of Illegals ) Did they stop trillions in unconstitutional spending? NO. Did they get rid of any of Clintonâ€™s unconstitutional Executive Orders? One or two but otherwise let Comrade Bill Clinton crap in our faces. Did they get rid of one unconstitutional cabinet like HHS, Department of Education and EPA? NO. Did they stop the unconstitutional foreign aid? NO. Did they stop unconstitutional spending for Planned Parenthood? NO. Congress just continues to use borrowed money to spend more debt. Did they stop unconstitutional spending for the gigantic hoax called global warming or climate change? NO. Trump: The Left Just Lost The War On Climate Change Did Bush, Jr., get us out of all the destructive trade treaties killing American jobs? NO. Did they crack down on visas bringing in tens of thousands of foreign workers when American workers who want to work are left in the unemployment line? NO. Did they stop more and more federal regulations strangling Americaâ€™s businesses? NO. Did they impeach one single activist judge destroying our freedom and liberty? NO. A Republican controlled Congress with a Republican in the White House and they did virtually NOTHING to restore America to a constitutional republic and constitutional spending. â€”â€“ 
So will things be any different under a Trump administration? 
We shall see. 
There will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo in many instances, because the process of fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse in the short-term. 
A great example of this is the national debt. As I discussed yesterday , the only reason why we are able to enjoy such a massively inflated standard of living in this country is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars from the rest of the world at ultra-low interest rates. 
If the federal government started spending only the money that it brought in through taxes, our ridiculous debt-fueled standard of living would begin collapsing immediately. 
We consume far more wealth than we produce, and the only way that we are able to do this is by borrowing insane amounts of money. 
Either Donald Trump will continue to borrow money recklessly, or we will go into a major league economic downturn. 
It really is that simple. 
But when our politicians borrow money, they are literally destroying the future of this country. So the choice is pain in the short-term or greater pain in the long-term. 
There is a way out, and that would involve shutting down the Federal Reserve and going to a completely debt-free form of money, but that is a topic for another article. 
And unfortunately that is not something that is even on Donald Trumpâ€™s radar at this point. 
No matter who won the election, the next president was going to be faced with some very harsh economic realities. 
There are many out there that have faith that Donald Trump can pull off an unprecedented economic miracle, but there are others that are deeply skeptical. 
Let us hope for the best, but let us also keep preparing for the worst."

21355,Watch: Police and Journalists Attacked During Swedish School Riot,Chris Tomlinson,"Eleven â€œyouthsâ€ have been arrested after a riot broke out at a school in Sweden that saw both police and TV journalists attacked with rocks by an angry mob. [The riot occurred at the AllÃ©skolan school in the town of Hallsberg on Monday afternoon. According to police, glass bottles and rocks were thrown at them, as well as at journalists. Officers say they have arrested 11 young men in connection with the riots and said they have no idea what started the conflict which escalated rapidly, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.   The SVT team, headed by reporter Anders Nord, were on the scene for the riot and were also attacked by the young men. Mr. Nord said that while police had arrested some of the youths, â€œanother group of masked youths, a little further away, shouted at police and threw stones. The scene commander then gave the order to police to put on helmets and approached the youth, who then ran from the scene. â€ In total, police say around 30 individuals participated in the riot, though there were no reports of any serious injuries on the scene. The youths arenâ€™t thought to be students at the school, but outsiders according to policeman Mats Ã–hman. â€œThey came to the school from what I understand was a continuation of a fight that was from last Friday,â€ he said. Ã–hman described how the events unfolded saying: â€œIt was pretty uncomfortable. It happened before we got on our helmets and the attack came as a bolt from the blue. Had anyone got hit in the head it would have been bad. â€ The fight that took place on Friday, which authorities say led to the Monday riot, is also mentioned on the Swedish police website with the police describing it as â€œmessyâ€ and saying that two factions of young men fought with each other.  Police did not identify the origins of the suspects involved on Friday or Monday, through video footage obtained by Swedish paper Nerikes Allehanda shows men who look to be of a foreign background. Attacks on police in Sweden have become increasingly more common and along with other issues have led to many officers quitting the force entirely. The main areas of danger for police have been the 55 or so No Go Zones across the country which are mostly populated by migrants. Even ambulance drivers have requested   helmets and other equipment to protect themselves from attack. Journalists in Sweden have also been attacked by â€œyouthsâ€ in the last year. Most recently, a photographer for Swedish Newspaper Dagens Nyheter was attacked during the recent riots in the no go area of Rinkeby and last year an Australian TV crew was attacked in the same area.

21356,Supreme Court Rules Priests DO NOT Have to Report Child Abuse,The Conservative Millennial,"In a highly controversial decision, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that Catholic priests are not â€œmandatory reportersâ€ of child abuse they are made privy to as a result of administering sacramental confessions. 
According to Patheos , the ruling references article 609 A(1) of the Louisiana Childrenâ€™s Code: 
With respect to mandatory reporters: Notwithstanding any claim of privileged communication, any mandatory reporter who has cause to believe that a childâ€™s physical or mental health or welfare is endangered as a result of abuse or neglect or that abuse or neglect was a contributing factor in a childâ€™s death shall report in accordance with Article 610. 
The Oct. 28 ruling states in part: 
â€¦ any communication made to a priest privately in the sacrament of confession for the purpose of confession, repentance, and absolution is a confidential communication under La. Code Evid. 511, and the priest is exempt from mandatory reporter status in such circumstances by operation of La. Child. Code art. 603, because â€œunder the â€¦ tenets of the [Roman Catholic] churchâ€ he has an inviolable â€œduty to keep such communications confidential.â€ 
The case which originally brought this issue before the court was that of a young woman who told a Baton Rouge-area Catholic priest that a longtime parishioner had sexually assaulted her when she was 14-years-old. The priest in turn did not report the abuse.

21358,The Humiliating Practice of Sex-Testing Female Athletes - The New York Times,Ruth Padawer,"One day in June 2014, Dutee Chand was cooling down after a set of   sprints when she received a call from the director of the Athletics Federation of India, asking her to meet him in Delhi. Chand, then 18 and one of Indiaâ€™s fastest runners, was preparing for the coming Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, her first big international event as an adult. Earlier that month, Chand won gold in both the   sprint and the     relay at the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Taipei, Taiwan, so her hopes for Scotland were high. Chand was raised in Gopalpur, a rural village in eastern India with only intermittent electricity. The family home was a small mud hut, with no running water or toilet. Her parents, weavers who earned less than $8 a week laboring on a   loom, were illiterate. They had not imagined a different life for their seven children, but Chand had other ideas. Now, as she took the   bus ride to Delhi from a training center in Punjab, she thought about her impending move to Bangalore for a new training program. She wondered if she would make friends, and how sheâ€™d manage there without her beloved coach, who had long been by her side, strategizing about how best to run each race and joking to help her relax whenever she was nervous. She thought little of the meeting in Delhi, because she assumed it was for a doping test. But when Chand arrived in Delhi, she says, she was sent to a clinic to meet a doctor from the Athletics Federation of India  â€”   the Indian affiliate of the International Association of Athletics Federations (I. A. A. F.) which governs track and field. He told her he would forgo the usual urine and blood tests because no nurse was available, and would order an ultrasound instead. That confused Chand, but when she asked him about it, she recalls, he said it was routine. Chand had no idea that her extraordinary showing in Taipei and at a national championship earlier that month had prompted competitors and coaches to tell the federation that her physique seemed suspiciously masculine: Her muscles were too pronounced, her stride was too impressive for someone who was only five feet tall. The doctor would later deny that the ultrasound was a response to those reports, saying he ordered the scan only because Chand had previously complained of chronic abdominal pain. She contends she never had any such pain. Three days after the ultrasound, the federation sent a letter titled â€œSubject: Gender Verification Issueâ€ to the Indian governmentâ€™s sports author ity. â€œIt has been brought to the notice of the undersigned that there are definite doubts regarding the gender of an Athlete Ms. Dutee Chand,â€ the letter read. It also noted that in the past, such cases â€œhave brought embarrassment to the fair name of sports in India. â€ The letter requested the author ities perform a â€œgender verification testâ€ on Chand. Shortly after, Chand says, she was sent to a private hospital in Bangalore, where a curt woman drew her blood to measure her level of natural testosterone, though Chand had no idea that was what was being measured. Chand also underwent a chromosome analysis, an M. R. I. and a gynecological exam that she found mortifying. To evaluate the effects of high testosterone, the international athletic associationâ€™s protocol involves measuring and palpating the clitoris, vagina and labia, as well as evaluating breast size and pubic hair scored on an illustrated   scale. The tests were meant to identify competitors whose chromosomes, hormones, genitalia, reproductive organs or secondary sex characteristics donâ€™t develop or align in the typical way. The word â€œhermaphroditeâ€ is considered stigmatizing, so physicians and advocates instead use the term â€œintersexâ€ or refer to the condition as D. S. D. which stands for either a disorder or a difference of sex development. Estimates of the number of intersex people vary widely, ranging from one in 5, 000 to one in 60, because experts dispute which of the myriad conditions to include and how to tally them accurately. Some intersex women, for instance, have XX chromosomes and ovaries, but because of a genetic quirk are born with ambiguous genitalia, neither male nor female. Others have XY chromosomes and undescended testes, but a mutation affecting a key enzyme makes them appear female at birth theyâ€™re raised as girls, though at puberty, rising testosterone levels spur a deeper voice, an elongated clitoris and increased muscle mass. Still other intersex women have XY chromosomes and internal testes but appear female their whole lives, developing rounded hips and breasts, because their cells are insensitive to testosterone. They, like others, may never know their sex development was unusual, unless theyâ€™re tested for infertility  â€”   or to compete in   sports. When Chandâ€™s results came in a few days later, the doctor said her â€œmale hormoneâ€ levels were too high, meaning she produced more androgens, mostly testosterone, than most women did. The typical female range is roughly 1. 0 to 3. 3 nanomoles of testosterone per liter of blood, about   that of typical males. Chandâ€™s level is not publicly known, but it was above the     threshold that the I. A. A. F. set for female competitors because that level is within the â€œmale range. â€ As a result, officials said, she could no longer race. In the two years since, Chand has been at the center of a legal case that contests not only her disqualification but also the international policy her lawyers say discriminates against athletes with atypical sex development. For Chand, who had never heard the words â€œtestosteroneâ€ or â€œintersex,â€ it has been a slow and painful education. When she was first told she was being barred because of her testosterone level, she didnâ€™t understand anything the officials were saying. â€œI said, â€˜What have I done that is wrong? â€™â€™u2009â€ she told me by phone in May through a Hindi translator. â€œThen the media got my phone number and started calling me and asking about an androgen test, and I had no idea what an androgen test was. The media asked, â€˜Did you have a gender test?â€™ And I said, â€˜What is a gender test? â€™â€™u2009â€ No governing body has so tenaciously tried to determine who counts as a woman for the purpose of sports as the I. A. A. F. and the International Olympic Committee (I. O. C. ). Those two influential organizations have spent a   vigorously policing gender boundaries. Their rationale for decades was to catch male athletes masquerading as women, though they never once discovered an impostor. Instead, the athletes snagged in those efforts have been intersex women  â€”   scores of them. The treatment of female athletes, and intersex women in particular, has a long and sordid his tory. For centuries, sport was the exclusive province of males, the competitive arena where masculinity was cultivated and proven. Sport endowed men with the physical and psychological strength that â€œmanhoodâ€ required. As women in the late 19th century encroached on explicitly male domains  â€”   sport, education, paid labor  â€”   many in society became increasingly anxious if a womanâ€™s place wasnâ€™t immutable, maybe a manâ€™s role, and the power it entailed, were not secure either. Well into the 20th century, women were discouraged from participating in sports. Some medical experts claimed that vigorous exercise would damage womenâ€™s reproductive capacity and their fragile emotional state and would make them muscular, â€œmannishâ€ and unattractive to men. Critics fretted that athletics would unbind women from femininityâ€™s modesty and  . As women athletesâ€™ strength and confidence grew, some observers began to wonder if fast, powerful athletes could even be women. In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the runners Stella Walsh of Poland and Helen Stephens of the United States were rumored to be male impostors because of their remarkable athleticism, â€œ â€ muscles and angular faces. After Stephens narrowly beat Walsh in the   dash and posted a world record, Stephens was publicly accused of being a man, by Walsh or Polish journalists  â€”   accounts vary. German Olympics officials had examined Stephensâ€™s genitals before the event and declared her female. Four decades later, in an unexpected twist, an autopsy of Walsh revealed she had ambiguous genitalia. In 1938, the gender of an athlete was again in dispute. The German   Dora Ratjen, a former   Olympian who won a gold medal at the European Athletics Championship, was suddenly identified as male, prompting Germany to quietly return the medal. When Ratjenâ€™s case became public years later  â€”   he claimed that the Nazis pressured him to pose as a woman for three years  â€”   it vali dated the growing anxiety about gender fraud in athletics. But in 2009, the magazine Der Spiegel investigated medical and police records and found Ratjen had been born with ambiguous genitals but, at the midwifeâ€™s suggestion, was raised as a girl, dressed in girlsâ€™ clothes and sent to girlsâ€™ schools. Dora lived as a female until two years after the 1936 Olympics, when police were alerted to a train traveler in womenâ€™s clothes who looked suspiciously masculine. With relief so apparent that the police noted it in their report, Ratjen told them that despite his parentsâ€™ claims, he had long suspected he was male. A police physician examined him and agreed, but reported that Ratjenâ€™s genitals were atypical. Ratjen changed his first name from Dora to Heinrich. But those details were unknown until recently, so for decades, Ratjen was considered a gender cheat. By the   international sports administrators began requiring female competitors to bring medical â€œfemininity certificatesâ€ to verify their sex. In the 1950s, many Olympics officials were so uneasy about womenâ€™s participation that Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein, a member of the International Olympic Committee, spoke for many when he said he wanted to â€œbe spared the unesthetic spectacle of women trying to look and act like men,â€ writes Susan K. Cahn, a his tory professor at the University at Buffalo, in her book â€œComing On Strong: Gender and Sexuality in   Womenâ€™s Sports. â€ Others were particularly bothered by women in track and field because of the strained expressions on their faces during competition. Such female exertion violated the white   ideal of femininity, as did the athletesâ€™ â€œmasculinizedâ€ physiques, prompting Olympic leaders to consider eliminating those events for women. In 1952, the Soviet Union joined the Olympics, stunning the world with the success and brawn of its female athletes. That year, women accounted for 23 of the Soviet Unionâ€™s 71 medals, compared with eight of Americaâ€™s 76 medals. As the Olympics became another front in the Cold War, rumors spread in the 1960s that   female athletes were men who bound their genitals to rake in more wins. Though those claims were never substantiated, in 1966 international sports officials decided they couldnâ€™t trust individual nations to certify femininity, and instead implemented a mandatory genital check of every woman competing at international games. In some cases, this involved what came to be called the â€œnude parade,â€ as each woman appeared, underpants down, before a panel of doctors in others, it involved womenâ€™s lying on their backs and pulling their knees to their chest for closer inspection. Several Soviet women who had dominated international athletics abruptly dropped out, cementing popular conviction that the Soviets had been tricking authorities. (More recently, some researchers have speculated that those athletes may have been intersex.) Amid complaints about the genital checks, the I. A. A. F. and the I. O. C. introduced a new â€œgender verificationâ€ strategy in the late â€™60s: a chromosome test. Officials considered that a more dignified, objective way to root out not only impostors but also intersex athletes, who, Olympic officials said, needed to be barred to ensure fair play. Ewa Klobukowska, a Polish sprinter, was among the first to be ousted because of that test she was reportedly found to have both XX and XXY chromosomes. An editorial in the I. O. C. magazine in 1968 insisted the chromosome test â€œindicates quite definitely the sex of a person,â€ but many geneticists and endocrinologists disagreed, pointing out that sex was determined by a confluence of genetic, hormonal and physiological factors, not any one alone. Relying on science to arbitrate the   divide in sports is fruitless, they said, because science could not draw a line that nature itself refused to draw. They also argued that the tests discriminated against those whose anomalies provided little or no competitive edge and traumatized women who had spent their whole lives certain they were female, only to be told they were not female enough to participate. One of those competitors was Maria JosÃ© MartÃ­nez PatiÃ±o, a    Spanish hurdler who was to run at the 1985 World University Games in Japan. The night before the race, a team official told her that her chromosome test results were abnormal. A more detailed investigation showed that although the outside of her body was fully female, PatiÃ±o had XY chromosomes and internal testes. But because of a genetic mutation, her cells completely resisted the testosterone she produced, so her body actually had access to less testosterone than a typical woman. Just before the Spanish national championships began, Spanish athletic officials told her she should feign an injury and withdraw from athletics permanently and without fuss. She refused. Instead, she ran the   hurdles and won, at which point someone leaked her test results to the press. PatiÃ±o was thrown off the national team, expelled from the athletesâ€™ resi dence and denied her scholarship. Her boyfriend and many friends and fellow athletes abandoned her. Her medals and records were revoked. PatiÃ±o became the first athlete to formally protest the chromosome test and to argue that disqualification was unjustified. After nearly three years, the I. A. A. F. agreed that without being able to use testosterone, her body had no advantage, and it reinstated PatiÃ±o. But by then, her hopes for making the Olympics were dashed. Dutee Chand was only 4 when she started running, tagging along with her sister, Saraswati, a competitive runner who liked to practice sprints along the local Brahmani River. Saraswati found training boring, so she recruited Dutee, 10 years her junior, to keep her company. For years, Dutee ran in bare feet  â€”   even on the villageâ€™s    streets  â€”   because she had to protect the only shoes she owned: flimsy rubber   that she knew her parents could not afford to replace. When Dutee was about 7, her parents pressed her to stop running and learn to weave instead. But Saraswati argued that with Duteeâ€™s speed, she could earn more as a sprinter. Saraswati, who has since become a police officer, reminded her parents of the benefits her own running had brought to the family. Once the district government realized Saraswatiâ€™s athletic potential, she, like other athletes, was given meat and chicken and eggs, food her family had not been able to afford. And she reminded them of the prize money she brought home whenever she did well in marathons. They agreed to let Dutee run. Not long after, Saraswati used a string to measure Duteeâ€™s foot and took a bus to the nearest city, about 60 miles away, to find an affordable pair of sturdy sneakers for her sister. The ride took three hours, frequently picking up passengers carrying goats or chickens and large bundles. When Saraswati gave Dutee the sneakers the next morning, Saraswati told me over the phone through a translator, Dutee yelped. â€œShe asked me what can happen if she runs wholeheartedly. She asked if she would go abroad like me, and said she had never sat in a bus or a train, and asked where the money will come from for her to go abroad. I said that â€˜if, with these shoes, you run well, you will be sent abroad from the money that will come to you, and not just that, but youâ€™ll also get a tracksuit. So run! â€™â€™u2009â€ In 2006,    Dutee was accepted into a   sports program more than two hours from the familyâ€™s home. Food, lodging and training were covered. She missed home but appreciated the dormâ€™s electricity, running water and indoor toilets. And she was happy she could send prize money to her parents. That same year, though Dutee didnâ€™t know it, a catastrophe was unfolding for another Indian sprinter. Santhi Soundarajan, a    from southern India, finished second in the 800 meters at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, all the more impressive given her roots as a member of Indiaâ€™s impoverished â€œuntouchableâ€ caste. The previous decade, the I. O. C. and I. A. A. F. yielded to pressure by the medical and scientific community and stopped   every female athlete. But the groups retained the right to test an athleteâ€™s chromosomes when questions about her sex arose and to follow that with a hormone test, a gynecological exam and a psychological evaluation. In Soundarajanâ€™s case, the media noted that she wasnâ€™t just fast she also had a deep voice and a flat chest. The day after Soundarajanâ€™s race, the Athletics Federation of India drew her blood and examined her body. Some of her results were leaked to the media. Shortly after, Soundarajan was watching TV when she saw a news report that she had â€œfailedâ€ a sex test. Rejected by the local sports federations, stripped of her silver medal, tormented by ongoing scrutiny and unbearably embarrassed, she attempted suicide, reportedly by swallowing poison. As Chand began competing in national athletics, another runner from a poor rural village, this time in South Africa, burst onto the interna tional athletic stage. When Caster Semenya blew by her opponents in the   race at the 2009 African Junior Championships, her performance raised suspicions. Shortly after, sports officials tested her as she prepared for the World Athletics Championship. Unconcerned  â€”   she assumed the investigation was for doping  â€”   Semenya won gold again. Almost immediately, the fact that Semenya had been   was leaked to the press. Instead of attending what is normally the celebratory news conference, Semenya went into hiding. The I. A. A. F. spokesman Nick Davies announced that if Semenya was an impostor, she could be stripped of her medal. He added: â€œHowever, if itâ€™s a natural thing, and the athlete has always thought sheâ€™s a woman or been a woman, itâ€™s not exactly cheating. â€ Fellow athletes, the press and commenters on social media scrutinized Semenyaâ€™s body and made much of her supposed gender transgressions: her muscular physique, her deep voice, her   pose, her unshaved armpits, the long shorts she ran in instead of bikini shorts, in addition to her extraordinary speed. A story on Time magazineâ€™s website was headlined â€œCould This Womenâ€™s World Champ Be a Man?â€ One of Semenyaâ€™s competitors, Elisa Cusma of Italy, who came in sixth, said: â€œThese kind of people should not run with us. For me, she is not a woman. She is a man. â€ The Russian star runner Mariya Savinova reportedly sneered, â€œJust look at her. â€ (The World   Agency would later accuse Savinova of using   drugs and recommend a lifetime ban.) The I. A. A. F. general secretary, Pierre Weiss, said of Semenya, â€œShe is a woman, but maybe not 100 percent. â€ Unlike India, South Africa filed a human rights complaint with the United Nations arguing that the I. A. A. F.â€™s testing of Semenya was â€œboth sexist and racist. â€ Semenya herself would later write in a statement, â€œI have been subjected to unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being. â€ After nearly a year of negotiations (the details of which are not public) the I. A. A. F. cleared Semenya to run in 2010, and she went on to win the silver medal in the 2012 Olympics. She will be running in Rio. But the federation still faced condemnation over leaks, public smears and the very idea of a sex test. The I. A. A. F. maintained it was obliged to protect female athletes from having â€œto compete against athletes with   performance advantages commonly associated with men. â€ In 2011, the association announced that it would abandon all references to â€œgender verificationâ€ or â€œgender policy. â€ Instead, it would institute a test for â€œhyperandrogenismâ€ (high testosterone) when there are â€œreasonable grounds for believingâ€ that a woman may have the condition. Women whose testosterone level was â€œwithin the male rangeâ€ would be barred. There were two exceptions: If a woman like Maria PatiÃ±o was resistant to testosteroneâ€™s effects  â€”   or if a woman reduced her testosterone. This entails having her undescended testes surgically removed or taking   drugs. Not long after the policy went into effect, sports officials referred four female athletes from â€œrural or mountainous regions of developing countriesâ€ to a French hospital to reduce their high testosterone, according to a 2013 article in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology  Metabolism. The authors, many of whom were physicians who treated the women, describe telling them that leaving in their internal testes â€œcarries no health risk,â€ but that removing them would allow the athletes to resume competition, though possibly hurt their performance. The women, who were between 18 and 21, agreed to the procedure. The physicians treating them also recommended surgically reducing their large clitorises to make them look more typical. The article doesnâ€™t mention whether they told their patients that altering their clitorises might impair sexual sensation, but it does say the women agreed to that surgery too. Chand was unaware of any controversy surrounding Semenya or other intersex athletes. Her gender concerns were much more immediate: She saw other    girls becoming curvier and heard them talk about getting their periods. She asked her mother why her body wasnâ€™t doing the same thing, and trusted her answer: Chandâ€™s body would change when it was good and ready. In 2012, Chand advanced to a   athletic training program, which in addition to food and lodging provided a stipend. At 16, she also became a national champion in the   category, winning the 100 meters in 11. 8 seconds. The next year, she won gold in the 100 meters and the 200 meters. In June 2014, she won gold yet again at the Asian championships in Taipei. Not long after that, she received the call to go to Delhi and was tested. After her results came in, officials told her she could return to the national team only if she reduced her testosterone level  â€”   and that she wouldnâ€™t be allowed to compete for a year. The particulars of her results were not made public, but the media learned, and announced, that Chand had â€œfailedâ€ a â€œgender testâ€ and wasnâ€™t a â€œnormalâ€ woman. For days, Chand cried inconsolably and refused to eat or drink. â€œSome in the news were saying I was a boy, and some said that maybe I was a transsexual,â€ Chand told me. â€œI felt naked. I am a human being, but I felt I was an animal. I wondered how I would live with so much humiliation. â€ As news spread that Chand had been dropped from the national team, advocates encouraged her to fight back. Payoshni Mitra, an Indian researcher with a doctorate in gender issues in sport who had advocated on behalf of other intersex athletes, suggested Chand send a letter to the Athletics Federation of India, requesting her disqualification be reversed. â€œI have not doped or cheated,â€ Chand said in Hindi, and Mitra, who would become Chandâ€™s   adviser, translated to English. â€œI am unable to understand why I am asked to fix my body in a certain way simply for participation as a woman. I was born a woman, reared up as a woman, I identify as a woman and I believe I should be allowed to compete with other women, many of whom are either taller than me or come from more privileged backgrounds, things that most certainly give them an edge over me. â€ Mitra and others also urged Chand to take her case to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport  â€”   the Supreme Court for sports disputes  â€”   arguing that the I. A. A. F.â€™s testosterone policy was discriminatory and should be rescinded. She agreed. Over four days in March 2015, a   panel heard Chandâ€™s appeal, as a total of 16 witnesses, including scientists, sports officials and athletes, testified. Female athletes, intersex and not, wondered just how this case would affect their lives. At the hearing, Paula Radcliffe, the British runner who holds the womenâ€™s world record for the marathon, testified for the I. A. A. F. saying elevated testosterone levels â€œmake the competition unequal in a way greater than simple natural talent and dedication. â€ She added, â€œThe concern remains that their bodies respond in different, stronger ways to training and racing than women with normal testosterone levels, and that this renders the competition fundamentally unfair. â€ Madeleine Pape, a 2008 Olympian from Aus tra lia, testified for Chand. Pape lost to Caster Semenya in the 2009 World Championships, Semenyaâ€™s last race before her   results were made public. Pape had heard runners complain that Semenya was a man or had   advantages, and she was angry that Semenya seemed to win so easily. â€œAt the time, I felt that people like Caster shouldnâ€™t be allowed to compete,â€ Pape told me. But in 2012, Pape began work on a sociology Ph. D. focusing on women in sport. â€œWith my running days behind me, I had the space to think more critically about all that,â€ she says. â€œUntil that point, I had no idea that the science of sex differences is extremely contested and has shifted over time, as have the regulations in sports, which change but donâ€™t improve as they try to get at the same questions. â€ Just what role testosterone plays in improving athletic performance is still being debated. At the hearing, both sides agreed that synthetic testosterone  â€”   doping with anabolic steroids  â€”   does ramp up performance, helping male and female athletes jump higher and run faster. But they disagreed vehemently about whether the bodyâ€™s own testosterone has the same effect. I. A. A. F. witnesses testified that logic suggests that natural testosterone is likely to work the way its synthetic twin does. They pointed to decades of I. A. A. F. and I. O. C. testing showing that a disproportionate number of elite female athletes, particularly in track and field, have XY chromosomes by their estimates, the presence of the Y chromosome in this group is more than 140 times higher than it is among the general female population. Surely, witnesses for the I. A. A. F. argued, that overrepresentation indicated that natural testosterone has an outsize influence on athletic prowess. Chandâ€™s witnesses countered that even if natural testosterone turns out to play a role in improving performance, testosterone alone canâ€™t explain the overrepresentation of intersex elite athletes after all, many of those XY female athletes had low testosterone or had cells that lacked androgen receptors. At the Atlanta Games in 1996, one of the few times the I. O. C. allowed detailed   data to be released, seven of the eight women who were found to have a Y chromosome turned out to be androgen insensitive: Their bodies couldnâ€™t use the testosterone they made. Some geneticists speculate that the overrepresentation might be because of a gene on the Y chromosome that increases stature height is clearly beneficial in several sports, though that certainly isnâ€™t a factor for Chand. In court, the I. A. A. F. acknowledged that menâ€™s natural testosterone levels, no matter how high, were not regulated the rationale, it said, was that there was no evidence that men with exceptionally high testosterone have a competitive advantage. Pressed by Chandâ€™s lawyer, the I. A. A. F. also conceded that no research had actually proved that unusually high levels of natural testosterone lead to unusually impressive sports performance in women either. Nor has any study proved that natural testosterone in the â€œmale rangeâ€ provides women with a competitive advantage commensurate with the 10 to 12 percent advantage that elite male athletes typically have over elite female athletes in comparable events. In fact, the I. A. A. F.â€™s own witnesses estimated the performance advantage of women with high testosterone to be between 1 and 3 percent, and the court played down the 3 percent figure, because it was based on limited, unpublished data. Chandâ€™s witnesses also pointed out that researchers had identified more than 200 biological abnormalities that offer specific competitive advantages, among them increased aerobic capacity, resistance to fatigue, exceptionally long limbs, flexible joints, large hands and feet and increased numbers of   muscle fibers  â€”   all of which make the idea of a level playing field illusory, and not one of which is regulated if it is innate. Bruce Kidd, a former   Olympic runner, told me in May that Olympians themselves sometimes joke that theyâ€™re all freaks of nature, with one or another genetic abnormality that makes them great at what they do. Kidd, a Canadian who has long pushed for gender equity in sports, noted that there are also many external variables that influence performance: access to excellent coaching, training facilities, healthy nutrition and so on. â€œIf athletic officials really want to address the significant factors affecting advantage, they should require all athletes to live in the same place, in the same level of wealth, with access to the same resources,â€ he says. â€œBoy, oh, boy, there are so many unfair advantages many Olympians have, starting with who their parents are. â€ But the I. A. A. F. argued that testosterone is different from other factors, because it is responsible for the performance gap between the sexes. That gap is the very reason sports is divided by sex, the I. A. A. F. says, so regulating testosterone is therefore justified. Chandâ€™s hearing, though, was about more than just testosterone. Implicitly, it questioned the decades of relentless scrutiny of female athletes  â€”   especially the most successful ones. Veronica Brenner, a Canadian who won a silver medal in freestyle skiing in 2002, told me she first learned that female Olympians had to pass a sex test when she arrived at the â€™98 Games in Nagano, Japan. â€œI said: â€˜Are you kidding?â€™ Iâ€™d been competing my whole life, and my gender has never been questioned!â€ Brennerâ€™s test confirmed that she had XX chromosomes, and she was given what was commonly called a â€œfemininity cardâ€ to prove she was the gender she claimed to be. But she was irked that despite the many advances of female athletes in the last   powerful male athletes are celebrated and powerful female ones are suspect. â€œWeâ€™d hear comments all the time: â€˜Sheâ€™s really strong  â€”   she must be part guy. â€™â€™u2009â€ Other critics see testosterone testing as simply the old â€œgender verification,â€ the latest effort to keep out women who donâ€™t adhere to gender norms or have a standard female body. Katrina Karkazis, a bioethicist at Stanford University who is a leader of the international campaign against banning intersex athletes and who testified in Chandâ€™s case, says that if an athleteâ€™s androgen test shows she has high testosterone, she must undergo the same gynecological exam that has existed for decades. â€œThe rationale behind the I. A. A. F.â€™s â€˜hyperandrogenism regulationâ€™ is to make it sound more scientifically justifiable and less discriminatory, but nothing in those exams has changed from the old policy except the name,â€ she says. â€œItâ€™s still based on very rigid binary ideas about sex and gender. â€ Critics of the I. A. A. F. policy argue that if sports officials were truly concerned about fairness, they would quit policing a handful of women with naturally high testosterone and instead rigorously investigate athletes suspected of taking drugs that indisputably enhance performance. They note that in the last year, the I. A. A. F. has faced bribery and blackmail charges and widespread allegations that it intentionally ignored hundreds of suspicious blood tests. StÃ©phane Bermon, an I. A. A. F. witness who took part in the efforts to identify females with high testosterone, acknowledged that doping was a significant threat to fairness but said tha"
21359,Hillary's Castro Endorsement,Humberto Fontova,"When Stalinist monsters bestow their blessing. November 3, 2016 Humberto Fontova 
â€œItâ€™s Hillaryâ€™s hour!...The only hope of defeating Donald Trump is Hillary Clintonâ€¦the difference between the two candidates is vast. Barack Obama did not exaggerate when he claimed that she was better prepared to be a U.S. President than even he wasâ€”or was her husband Bill Clinton.â€ (Stalinist Cubaâ€™s KGB-founded and mentored media organ Cubadebate, Oct. 15, 2016.) 
There was a day when winning a ringing endorsement from communist mass-murdering, terror -sponsors who craved (and came within a whisker) of nuking your nation would NOT be considered an asset for a U.S. Presidential candidate. 
â€œ In any nation of the worldâ€“and even in the U.S. during normal timesâ€“Donald Trump would find himself either in prison or in a mental institution!â€ 
There was a day when being threatened with prison and torture (even figuratively) by an enemy Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured political prisoners (many of them U.S. citizens) at a higher rate than Stalin during the Great Terror would be considered an enormous asset for a U.S. Presidential candidate. 
But the ringing communist endorsement for Hillary Clinton gets even â€œbetter:â€ 
â€œ Hillary Clinton is our only hope of detaining barbarism!â€ 
So warns the eunuch scribe for a totalitarian regime that murdered more Cubans in its first three years in power than Hitler murdered Germans during his first sixâ€“ and in the process converted a highly-civilized, immigrant-swamped nation into a slum/sewer with the Hemisphereâ€™s highest suicide rate, which is ravaged by tropical diseases, where tens of thousands have died trying to escape, where alley cats constitute a delicacy and where ox-carts represent luxury transportation. 
â€œOn a few occasions Trump has even suggested the assassination of Hillary Clinton!â€ 
So warn the notorious assassins of suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging from Camilo Cienfuegos to Tony De la Guardia to Manuel â€œBarbarrojaâ€™ Pineiro. Yes, the Castro regime â€œdevoured its own childrenâ€ even more voraciously than even Lenin and Stalinâ€™s. 
â€œThe news are dominated by revelationsâ€”some on videoâ€”showing Trumpâ€™s obscenity and male chauvinist conductâ€”along with his treatment of women as sex objects!â€ 
So warns the Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured 35,150 Cuban women for political crimes, a totalitarian horror utterly unknown in the Western Hemisphere until the Castro brothers and Che Guevara took power. Some of these Cuban ladies suffered twice as long in Castroâ€™s Gulag as Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered in Stalinâ€™s. 
Their prison conditions were described by former political prisoner Maritza Lugo. â€œThe punishment cells measure 3 feet wide by 6 feet long. The toilet consists of an 8 inch hole in the ground through which cockroaches and rats enter, especially in cool temperatures the rat come inside to seek the warmth of our bodies and we were often bitten. The suicide rate among women prisoners was very high.â€ 
On Christmas Eve of 1961 a Cuban woman named Juana Diaz Figueroa spat in the face of the executioners who were binding and gagging her. Castro and Che Guevara's KGB-trained secret police had found her guilty of feeding and hiding â€œbanditsâ€ (Cuban rednecks who took up arms to fight the Stalinist theft of their land to build Sovietâ€“style Kolkhozes.) When the blast from Castroite firing squad demolished her face and torso Juana was six months pregnant. 
â€œThey started by beating us with twisted coils of electric cable,â€ recalls former Cuba political prisoner Ezperanza Pena from exile today. â€œI remember Teresita on the ground with all her lower ribs broken. Gladys had both her arms broken. Doris had her face cut up so badly from the beatings that when she tried to drink, water would pour out of her lacerated cheeks.â€ 
â€œOn Motherâ€™s Day they allowed family visits,â€ recalls Manuela Calvo from exile today.â€ But as our mothers and sons and daughters were watching, we were beaten with rubber hoses and high-pressure hoses were turned on us, knocking all of us the ground floor and rolling us around as the guards laughed and our loved-ones screamed helplessly.â€ 
â€œWhen female guards couldnâ€™t handle us male guards were called in for more brutal beatings. I saw teen-aged girls beaten savagely, their bones broken, their mouths bleeding ,â€ recalls Polita Grau. 
Thousands upon thousands of Cuban women have also drowned, died of thirst or have been eaten alive by sharks attempting to flee the regime founded by the folks who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton. This from a nation formerly richer than half the nations of Europe and deluged by immigrants from same. 
Remember how Donald Trump was taken greatly to task by the media for not quickly repudiating David Dukeâ€™s (so-called) endorsement? 
Well, we certainly look for the media to take Hillary Clinton similarly to task for not instantly repudiating the endorsement of mass-jailing, mass-torturing, mass-murdering Stalinists. 
After all, recalling the â€œsticks and stones can break my bonesâ€ riddle of our childhood, David Dukeâ€™s crimesâ€ consist of words (â€œhate-speech.â€) Whereas the (literal) sticks, stones--and chains, manacles, bullwhips and bullets--of the fine folks so enthusiastically endorsing Hillary Clinton have caused untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people."
21360,"Wiganâ€™s Road to â€˜Brexitâ€™: Anger, Loss and Class Resentments - The New York Times",Andrew Higgins,"WIGAN, England  â€”   After jobs as a garbage man, a bakery worker and now a packer at a canned food factory, Colin Hewlett, like most people in Wigan, a gritty northern English town, takes great pride in his   credentials. He plays snooker and drinks pints at the Working Menâ€™s Club across the road from his red brick rowhouse, and at every election that he can remember, he has voted, like his father before him, for the Labour Party. The governing Conservative Party, which last won a parliamentary election in Wigan in 1910, is â€œfor rich sods and second raters on the make,â€ he explained. On June 23, however, Mr. Hewlett broke with the habits of a lifetime and bucked the Labour Party line. Ignoring its stand that the European Union is good for Britain, he voted to bolt from the European bloc, along with 64 percent of the population in a town that, according to Will Patterson, a local Green Party activist, would normally â€œvote for a cow if Labour put one up for election. â€ The overwhelming vote here in favor of â€œBrexitâ€  â€”   much higher than the 52 percent who voted to leave nationwide  â€”   delivered a stinging rebuke not only to the Labour Party leadership in London but also to the partyâ€™s local politicians. They hold 65 of the 75 seats on the Borough Council and campaigned, albeit with little zeal, for the Remain camp. The Conservative Party, whose leader, Prime Minister David Cameron, also campaigned for Britain to stay in Europe, got kicked in the teeth, too, as did President Obama and legions of other prominent figures in Britain and abroad who urged voters like Mr. Hewlett not to rock the boat. But rocking the boat, no matter what the risks, was precisely what he and millions of other Britons  â€”   who, regardless of their real economic situation, see themselves as members of a downtrodden â€œworking classâ€  â€”   wanted to do. To them, it was a last, desperate effort to restore a lost world of secure jobs and communities that was far harsher in reality than it is in recollection. Their votes were stark evidence of how   resentments, driven by feelings of being ignored and left unmoored in a rapidly changing world, are feeding nationalism and other efforts to reclaim a sense of identity, upending ideological assumptions and straining ties to political parties and other institutions. Indeed, the   demise of traditional   jobs in Wigan and the rest of Britain has not ended peopleâ€™s attachment to the idea that they belong to a   proletariat. A survey of social attitudes released last week by NatCen Social Research, a British research group, found that while only 25 percent of Britons had jobs that involved routine or manual labor, the traditional markers of   membership, 60 percent of British people viewed themselves as working class. This disconnect between the jobs people hold and their class allegiance is a phenomenon that the researchers called â€œworking class of the mind. â€ It helps explain that while only a small minority of Britons share the real insecurity and poverty of workers like Mr. Hewlett, many others feel they are getting a raw deal  â€”   and want to stick it to those in power, whether in Brussels or London. â€œI donâ€™t think a lot will change. But we have to give it a chance,â€ said Mr. Hewlett, 61, sitting next to his wife, who has Alzheimerâ€™s disease, in a cluttered front room, its faded walls plastered with photographs of their six children and 14 grandchildren. Life, he said, has â€œgone to the dogs,â€ and meddling from outside is to blame. â€œI donâ€™t like people telling us what to do from miles away. â€ In just three years, Mr. Hewlett explained, his   pay had crashed from more than $665 a week to just $318. Worse, he added, is that his previously secure   employment contract has morphed into a â€œzero hours contract,â€ under which his employer decides how much he works and how much it pays him depending on what it needs on any particular day. â€œIt is basically slave labor,â€ Mr. Hewlett said. He complained that an influx of eager workers from poorer, formerly communist parts of the European Union meant that employers now had no incentive to offer a fixed contract or more than the minimum wage for menial work. The real number of immigrants living and working in Wigan is tiny, with only 2. 9 percent of the population born outside Britain, compared with a nationwide figure of 11. 5 percent, the Office of National Statistics says. Only 1. 7 percent of those living in Wigan were born in European Union countries other than Britain. The unemployment rate, the local council says, is only 5 percent, slightly below the national level and half the rate in European countries that use the euro. But this has not stopped even some of Wiganâ€™s immigrants from complaining about there being too many foreigners, particularly Poles, in the area. Abdul Rao, a longtime immigrant from Pakistan with three children born in Wigan, said he had voted for Brexit because he did not want new immigrants spoiling his childrenâ€™s job prospects. Justyna Kolenda, a Polish immigrant who works in a clothing store, complained that too many Poles and other newcomers did not speak English and mixed only with one another. â€œThere should be more controls,â€ she said, strolling with her English boyfriend down a pretty shopping street bedecked with British flags in memory of the bloody 1916 Battle of the Somme.   advocates hail   labor flexibility, ensured by zero hour contracts and other devices, as one of the main reasons for Britainâ€™s robust economy compared with the sluggish or shrinking economies of the Continent. Yet, for workers like Mr. Hewlett, who has no special skills and is not in a position to acquire any, this flexibility is a curse  â€”   and one of the reasons that poorer,   Britons voted heavily to quit the European Union. That the faceless bureaucrats in Brussels played no role in shaping Britainâ€™s labor market  â€”   that was done by elected policy makers in London as Britain fought to retain its competitiveness amid the pressures of globalization  â€”   did nothing to dent a widespread view here in Wigan: that leaving the European Union might somehow jolt the country onto another track, preferably one that recovers the lost security and sense of belonging of the past. Mr. Patterson, the Green Party activist, recalled how he had struggled in vain during the referendum campaign to convince Wigan voters that their interests were aligned with those of â€œworkers in Stuttgart and Gdansk,â€ and that they needed to make common cause with them against   governments across Europe pushing austerity and   labor policies. When he put this argument forward at a debate in Wigan, he recalled, a woman jumped to her feet and shouted: â€œI am not interested in Stuttgart. I am only interested in Wigan. â€ Britainâ€™s feeling of remoteness from Europe is often attributed to its   as what Shakespeare called â€œthis sceptered isle. â€ But the country is not just one island  â€”   or two when Northern Ireland is included  â€”   but a host of largely   islets, each with its own history, its own accent and its own proud sense of splendid isolation. â€œWigan is a very insular society. When the chips are down, the population here is very loyal to itself,â€ said David Molyneux, the Labour Partyâ€™s deputy leader of the Borough Council. After years of deep cuts in funding from London, which has slashed the local budget by 40 percent since 2010, Wigan voted not so much to grab   power back from Brussels, but from London. Local pride, particularly strong in a town that resents George Orwell for portraying it as a sinkhole of misery in â€œThe Road to Wigan Pier,â€ sometimes swerves toward xenophobia, though overt racism is mostly limited to a tiny   fringe. Yet, in many ways, Britainâ€™s referendum result was less a revolt against the European Union than against political and economic forces that are blurring not only boundaries between countries but also smaller, narrower frontiers that once clearly defined who was and was not â€œlocal,â€ and who belongs where in that most enduring feature of British life, the class hierarchy. Mark Bradley, the leader of the Wigan branch of the U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP, the driving force behind the Brexit campaign, complained that the areaâ€™s Labour Party member of Parliament, Lisa Nandy, was out of touch with her constituents and their desire to leave Europe because she â€œis not even from Wigan. â€ She grew up in Bury, a town barely 15 miles away. â€œShe is definitely not local,â€ Mr. Bradley said. Owen Jones, a columnist for the   newspaper The Guardian, described the shocking referendum result as being â€œabove all else a   revolt,â€ a cry for help by the downtrodden whose travails and desperation Orwell chronicled 80 years ago. When Orwell visited Wigan, however, the working class existed as a clear socioeconomic category defined by backbreaking work for   wages in coal mines and factories. Today, the mines and cotton mills are all gone, extinguished by forces set in motion long before Britain joined the European Economic Community, the predecessor to the European Union, in 1973, or reaffirmed its membership in a 1975 referendum. Mr. Molyneux, the deputy council chief, said the area had changed markedly for the better since 1975, with large areas of slums and derelict factories cleared away. But, he added, â€œmemories are clouded of what life was really like,â€ and many people hark back to a lost, albeit mostly imaginary, era of secure, tightknit communities built around coal mines and manufacturing. Mr. Bradley, of UKIP, lamented the decline of locally owned pubs, shops and other businesses in the face of competition from corporate chains. â€œThere is a longing for a better time,â€ he said. Like a phantom limb, the lost era still twitches, with fading,   memories kept alive in places like the Leigh Miners Welfare Institute, a bar and social club on the edge of the borough. Taking a break from a game of bowls on the clubâ€™s manicured bowling green, Raymond Gorton, an    former coal miner, showed off a mangled finger smashed by a mine accident in the 1950s and recalled how he had almost been killed in a 1965 accident that shattered his neck. All the same, he had fond memories of the camaraderie of a lost world that revolved around the pit. Forced to give up mining decades ago because of his injuries, Mr. Gorton said he still wakes each morning at 5, a routine left from his time on the early shift at the Wood End Pit. â€œIt is very hard to break old habits,â€ he said. He, too, voted to leave the European Union, not because it had interfered with his life in any concrete way but because he did not like the idea of â€œtaking orders from outsiders. â€ He had also been impressed by the claim  â€”   entirely false  â€”   put forward by Brexit campaigners that leaving would save Britain 350 million pounds a week that could be better spent on the National Health Service. He volunteered that he did not mind immigrants, noting that he got on well with two Polish families living on his street, but nonetheless thought that â€œwe need to start thinking more about our own people. â€ Clinching the argument for Brexit was the memory of his father, who he said had served with the Royal Air Force and been killed by the Germans in 1940. Britain, he said, should not be part of a European bloc dominated by Germany. But it is not just German power that bothers him. He is more uneasy over a local imbalance of power that has left his own hometown, Leigh, controlled by the Borough Council in Wigan after the merging of several districts in 1974. That amalgamation, which had nothing to do with Brussels, has left many in Leigh resentful of Wigan, which is only five miles away but which they see as an alien and bullying force. â€œWe feel pushed around,â€ Mr. Gorton said."
21361,Clinton emails: FBI director ignored Attorney General's advice not to 'take action that could influence election',nan,"Trending Articles: Trending Articles: Clinton emails: FBI director ignored Attorney General's advice not to 'take action that could influence election'   Source: The Independent 
FBI director James Comey reportedly ignored the advice of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who urged him not to thrust the controversy over Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails back into headlines less than a fortnight from election day. 
US Department of Justice officials, Democrats and even some Republicans were said to be aghast at the timing of the FBIâ€™s announcement, on Friday, that it was reviewing a fresh cache of emails, which Mr Comey said may be â€œpertinentâ€ to the investigation into Ms Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
According to a report from the New Yorker , Ms Lynch â€œexpressed her preferenceâ€ that Mr Comey uphold the Justice Department's â€œlongstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election.â€ The FBI director, however, â€œsaid that he felt compelled to do otherwise.â€ 
Writing in the Washington Post , former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Mr Comeyâ€™s decision was a â€œtroubling violation of long-standing Justice Department rules or precedent, conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nationâ€™s chief investigative official.â€ 
The emails were discovered â€œin connection with an unrelated case,â€ the FBI director wrote in a letter to Republican congressional committee chairs on Friday. That separate case, it later emerged, concerns disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner , who is under investigation for allegedly sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. 
Mr Weiner is the estranged husband of Ms Clintonâ€™s closest aide, Huma Abedin , and the emails were found on one or more electronic devices belonging to the couple, which had been seized as part of the Weiner probe. The FBI is now investigating whether those emails contained any classified information."
21362,Sundance Horror Hit Casts â€™Liberal Eliteâ€™ as the Monster,Jerome Hudson,"Comedian Jordan Peele debuted his new horror film, Get Out, this week at the Sundance Film Festival, and the most shocking thing about the film is its bad guy: white liberal racism. [â€œIt was very important to me for this not to be about a black guy going to the South and going to this red state where the presumption for a lot of people is everybodyâ€™s racist there,â€ Peele told the audience after the filmâ€™s midnight screening. â€œThis was meant to take a stab at the liberal elite that tends to believe that â€˜Weâ€™re above these things. â€™â€  Get Out follows the events that unfold when a young black man Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets the wealthy liberal parents of his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) who are carrying out an evil plan to imprison their   suburbâ€™s few black residents.  The idea for Get Out  â€”   a film which Peele thought â€œwas never going to get madeâ€  â€”   came during the 2008 presidential primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. â€œAll of a sudden the country was kind of focused on black civil rights and womenâ€™s civil rights movements and where they intersect, and there was kind of this question of, who deserves to be president more?â€ Peele explained. â€œWhoâ€™s waited long enough? Which is an absurd thing  â€”   that civil rights are even divided. â€ Drawing from The Stepford Wives, Peeleâ€™s favorite film, the comic was able to develop a plot that exposed what he called the â€œ  lieâ€ that â€œweâ€™re pastâ€ this â€œmonster of racismâ€  â€”   a lie that Peele admits doesnâ€™t flow from â€œred states. â€ One example of this â€œ  lieâ€ in the film is evident when Chrisâ€™s girlfriend fails to mention to her neurosurgeon father (Bradley Whitford) that her new boyfriend is black. Roseâ€™s father constantly calls Chris â€œmy man,â€ admits that he would have voted for Obama for a third term, and said his father lost at the Olympics to Jesse Owens and has affinity for the Nazis. It all feels like soft bigotry, Peele explains to the audience. â€œThat is how we experience racism. The monster of racism lurks underneath that conversation. â€ Get Out, Peele says, is â€œcoming out in a very different Americaâ€ than the one in which he wrote the script for the film. â€œItâ€™s more important and interesting now,â€ he says, in the era of President Trump. Peele is perhaps best known for his starring role on the hit Comedy Central series Key and Peele, where his portrayal of a   President Obama became an Internet sensation. The comedian recently reprised the role on Comedy Centralâ€™s The Daily Show for one final time alongside   Key, who played President Obamaâ€™s â€œanger translatorâ€ Luther. Get Out opens in theaters on February 24.    Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson"
21363,Thailand Looks to Likely Future King With Apprehension - The New York Times,Alison Smale and Thomas Fuller,"TUTZING, Germany  â€”   For more than two years, the king of Thailand lay ill in a Bangkok hospital. During much of that time, his son, the heir to Thailandâ€™s throne, was far from the kingdom, flying around Europe in his Boeing 737 and ensconced in luxury villas and hotels amid the misty lakes and mountains of southern Germany and Austria. The lavish European lifestyle of the son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, and his tastes for airplanes, fast cars, women and the high life have caused great anxiety in the kingdom for decades. Now he is on the cusp of ascending the throne. The death of the beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Thursday has set in motion a succession that many Thais say they wish they could avoid. King Bhumibol had been a unifying figure in a country that is torn by deep divisions of class and politics and is currently ruled by a military junta. The issue is whether the prince, seen by many Thais as lacking the deep public devotion that his father enjoyed, can hold the country together. The princeâ€™s ascension also raises questions about the future of the monarchy, as a   king could give strength to a republican movement that has gained a foothold in recent years. Among the issues at stake is control over one of the worldâ€™s great royal fortunes, an estimated $31 billion in real estate holdings alone. Succession may force the consideration of an unresolved and rarely discussed question of whether those assets and others are the property of the royal family or of the Thai public. The crown prince, 64, has led a stormy life of byzantine quarrels and breakups with various lovers that were rarely fully elucidated in public. To his critics, his romantic liaisons have been more than just a royal soap opera they have raised questions about whether his character suits the institution he is about to lead. Having multiple lovers is a dynastic tradition  â€”   his   King Rama V had more than 150 wives and consorts  â€”   but the princeâ€™s former partners have endured spiteful separations and the purged members of his entourage have died under suspicious circumstances. His three divorces, and the brusque ways they were handled, turned many Thais against him and left a trail of broken families, including four children in the United States with whom he has cut ties. The crown prince returned to Thailand in time to be present for his fatherâ€™s death on Thursday. But the timing of his accession remains in question. Gen. Prayuth   the prime minister, surprised the nation on Thursday when he told reporters that the prince had decided to wait until the â€œappropriate timeâ€ to ascend the throne, which is still replete with the ancient pageantry and extreme formality made famous by the musical â€œThe King and I. â€ What details are known of the crown princeâ€™s life are whispered and passed along furtively on social media in Thailand, where the military government, enforcing a strict   law, has sentenced dozens of people to long prison terms for offending the monarchy. The law has been interpreted broadly, stifling most public discussion of anything related to the royal family. But the few details that have emerged in public records, leaked documents and videos, and in publications from abroad offer a glimpse into the man who stands to be Thailandâ€™s next king. The prince was still married to his first wife, his cousin Soamsawali Kitiyakara, in the 1970s and â€™80s when he fathered five children with another woman, according to Thai news accounts at the time. The other woman, an aspiring actress and a commoner, Sujarinee Vivacharawongse, would become his second wife. That second marriage ended in the late 1990s in such acrimony that a public notice was posted at the princeâ€™s palace accusing Ms. Sujarinee of corruption and infidelity with a soldier. The prince cut off communication with four of the five children from the marriage, stripped them of their royal titles and diplomatic passports, and wrote letters, since posted online by an exiled academic, to their British boarding schools informing them that he would no longer pay their tuition. They now live in the United States, as does their mother. His third marriage, also to a commoner, Srirasmi Suwadee, in 2001, produced the boy who is considered the next heir to the throne, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, 11, who lives in Bavaria with his father. Thais got a rare insight into the third marriage when a video clip of an elaborate poolside birthday party circulated widely on computer discs and on the internet. The video, which showed the princess topless with a string bikini bottom being attended to by submissive palace staff, scandalized a public accustomed to perceiving the monarchy as a paragon of virtue. It was never clear how the video had been leaked but some suggested that the princeâ€™s enemies had spread it to promote the possibility that his sister Princess Sirindhorn, beloved by the public for her devotion to charitable causes, could become monarch in his stead. The footage of the party was never publicly discussed in Thailandâ€™s news media. The crown princeâ€™s marriage to Ms. Srirasmi blew up spectacularly in 2014, when members of her family were suddenly swept up by the police, charged and brought to trial. At least three of Ms. Srirasmiâ€™s siblings were sent to prison for crimes including illegal possession of firearms and insulting the monarchy, according to police statements. Her mother and father were sentenced to prison for insulting the monarchy. Her uncle Pongpat Chayapan, a   police officer, was convicted of running illegal casinos, oil smuggling, money laundering and other crimes. Ms. Srirasmi gave up  her royally bestowed name, according to an entry in The Royal Gazette, but she was given a stipend of more than $5 million of government funds from the Crown Property Bureau, a payment made public in a letter signed by the junta chief. The purge reinforced fears of an ominous, violent side in the princeâ€™s entourage. One of a handful of police officers purged in the 2014 separation, Akkharawit Limrat, died under mysterious circumstances, his body hastily cremated, according to a funeral certificate published in the Thai news media. The police, calling the matter â€œsensitive,â€ gave only scant details. Lt. Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri, then the police spokesman, described the death this way: â€œHe got stressed out. So he jumped out of the building and died. â€ A separate purge last year of aides to the crown prince had a similar outcome. Two of the three men arrested died in custody in military barracks. The purges have somewhat overshadowed recent efforts by the government to rehabilitate the princeâ€™s image, including broadcasts of his riding in bicycle tours to celebrate the king and queen and the release of a video showing him caring for his son Dipangkorn in Germany. Critics said that after the purge of his third wife, those images sought to present him as a healthy, responsible father. The efforts suggested that the military had cast its lot with the prince, trying to forge the same kind of mutually beneficial alliance it had with his father. The king heads the armed forces and must approve all governments, while the military draws its legitimacy from the monarchâ€™s blessing. Then thereâ€™s the matter of who will be the new queen. Like so many other parts of the crown princeâ€™s life, the answer is shrouded in secrecy. A former flight attendant, Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhaya, has appeared by the princeâ€™s side on the official royal broadcasts and has been bestowed the military rank of lieutenant general. Kasit Piromya, a former foreign minister, said he met Ms. Suthida many times when he was in government. â€œSheâ€™s an air hostess, very lively, highly intelligent,â€ he said. â€œShe can ski, she can bike. She loves music. She knows what is good wine in Italy. â€ Ms. Suthida appears to live with the crown prince in Bavaria. Bild, the German tabloid, published a photograph in July of the crown prince on an airport runway in   jeans, with what appeared to be tattoos covering his back and arms. The princeâ€™s companion, possibly Ms. Suthida, is wearing stiletto heels and a tight shirt, midriff exposed, an outfit that might not raise eyebrows in Europe but would disqualify any tourist from entering the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The prince bought two villas in southern Germany last year, one on the exclusive Lake Starnberg for an estimated $13 million, and another, said to have cost some $5. 5 million, in the adjacent community of Feldafing. When Andreas Botas, a real estate agent in Tutzing, showed the prince and his entourage a property there last year, three black Mercedes vans, a white Porsche and three more vans arrived for the appointment. The driver of the Porsche turned out to be the prince, â€œdressed in a skimpy   and jeans but very good shoes,â€ Mr. Botas said. The prince looked carefully at the villaâ€™s 12 main rooms as servants lay prostrate or knelt on the ground ready to start the white Porsche and open the driver and passenger doors. Ultimately, Mr. Botas said, the prince bought the other villas. Bavaria offers the crown prince the privacy that he appears to crave. In Tutzing, the princeâ€™s   villa is defended from prying eyes by a fence and hedge more than six feet tall. In Feldafing, few locals seem to know the prince, but neighbors said they heard parties around the private pool late into the night last summer. Occasional public appearances sometimes make news in the German and Austrian news media. The crown princeâ€™s entourage, they reported, has visited a pumpkin farm, picked strawberries and toured parts of Bavaria on mountain bikes. In the Austrian ski resort of Zell am Ziller, the princeâ€™s entourage in 2014 rented 70 rooms in a spa hotel and demanded the installation of a kitchen where the princeâ€™s own cook prepared his food, according to an article in the Innsbruck newspaper Tiroler Tageszeitung. But for the most part, this community shelters its wealthy residents with discreet propriety. The deputy mayor of Tutzing, Elisabeth DÃ¶rrenberg, said only that her community of some 10, 000 welcomed wealthy and prominent people, but said nothing specifically about the prince. The town does not show off its wealth there is no   hotel or   restaurant. The mayor of Feldafing, Bernhard Sontheim, was equally reticent. The princeâ€™s entourage showed up at his office in July, the mayor said, and spent half an hour chatting about generalities. The prince, he said, â€œis now a resident of Feldafing, he lives here and that is that. â€"
21364,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Just Released Full ISIS Donor List With Names | Conservative Daily Post,Martin Walsh,"
Posted by Martin Walsh | Oct 28, 2016 | Breaking News Julian Assange Can No Longer Remain Quiet 
Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. 
After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. 
Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. 
An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: â€œWestern intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the regionâ€ to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of â€œproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.â€ Citing the need to â€œuse our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,â€ said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were â€œimportant to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.â€ Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillaryâ€™s largest donations come from those two countries. She Is Funded By Nations That Fund ISIS. Coincidence? 
In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 â€œbirthday check.â€ 
The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would â€œwelcome [the Clinton Foundationâ€™s] suggestions for investments in Haiti â€” particularly on education and health.â€ Desai added that while Qatar had already â€œallocated most of their $20 million â€¦ [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.â€ Bill Clinton gets $1M from Qatar for his birthday. FYI: It's legal and common practice in Qatar for husbands to beat and rape their wives. pic.twitter.com/oGM2Z9JrVl 
â€” Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 13, 2016 
We now see two more examples of the Clintonâ€™s acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. 
For those that do not see where the dots connect, letâ€™s simplify how this all worked for Hillary. 
Hillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her â€œfoundation.â€ These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. 
That is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. 
They are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. 
It also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange. If Julian Assange is lying, why are they trying so hard to silence him? 
â€” Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 23, 2016 
The media remains silent on all of this. This would be plastered all over the news for months if a President Trump was exposed for this. 
Ignorant politicians are not the problem. The problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election. This is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country, and it starts with Donald Trump. 
People like Julian Assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing Hillary Clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless. 
He has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government. Chances likes this do not occur often, and if we do not seize the opportunity, we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders. 
Vote Trump, so that we can save America and he can pardon Julian Assange. "
21365,Will the Media Reset After the Election or Are We Stuck With This Tabloid Stuff?,Peter Van Buren,"Written by Peter Van Buren   venerable New York Times ran a story saying Donald Trump lies about the height of his buildings.For no apparent reason, the Times resurrected some information from 1979 saying Trump insisted on counting the basement levels of his signature Trump Tower in the overall count of how many floors the building has. The Times compares this lie to â€œreportsâ€ that Trump adds an inch to his actual body height in his bio materials, and also repeated the gag line that he boasted about how long his penis is (no word on whether it is or is not actually longer than expected.)You have to wade down to paragraph 12 to learn other New York developers use the same count-the-basements levels gimmick to be able to advertise their buildings as taller. There is absolutely no news. The Russians Head over to Slate , which published an â€œinvestigative pieceâ€ alleging a Trump computer server was secretly communicating with a Russian bank. The story had previously been debunked by the New York Times and The Intercept, but Slate ran it as if they had uncovered the smoking gun proving Trump is under the control of the Russians.At Mother Jones , another article alleged that an anonymous, former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidency.â€œThereâ€™s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spyâ€™s memos,â€ the story said. â€œBut a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking.â€One more example, from Vox , which wrote without even bothering to source it at all â€œThere is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign. There is strong evidence linking Trumpâ€™s foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trumpâ€™s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests.â€ Journalism Much? Iâ€™ve chosen these examples because they are from publications that have in the past enjoyed decent reputations for reporting, and because these stories were run as â€œnews,â€ not opinion columns, where the standards go right through the floor. Even Mother Jones, which clearly works left-of-center, used to do so with some solid journalism.Not any more.These places (never find fringe publications) are now working with the same standards once reserved for reporting on aliens at Roswell, Elvis sightings and the Illuminati New World Order. It is apparently now within the bounds of mainstream journalism to build a story out of, well, nothing, such as a factoid from 1979, or essentially accuse a presidential candidate of treason based on a single, anonymous source, or claim the Russians have taken over our electoral process based on no sources at all. And Clintonâ€¦ On the other side, reporting on Clinton by many of these same publications swerves between hagiography and poo-pooing away anything unfavorable. Emails? Who cares! Questions about what her accomplishments as Secretary of State really were? If you ask, you hate women. Pay-for-Play with the Clinton Foundation? Hah, everybody does it, it doesnâ€™t matter. The standard seems to be absent a notarized receipt for a donation matching an arms sale, or a criminal conviction, nothing matters. Next? So be it. The media has fully sh*t the bed this election. Thatâ€™s where we find ourselves.But whatâ€™s next? Will the media reset itself after November 8, or will they run President Trump is Putinâ€™s dog stories for the full term? Will President Clinton be given a pass on, well, everything, for four years, with apologists and explainers on the front page of the Times, never mind in editorials?At what point will the media dig themselves out of this and start real reporting again?

21366,Merkel Will Pay Migrants Millions To Leave Germany,Jack Montgomery,"Chancellor Angela Merkel is setting aside â‚¬90m (Â£76m) in taxpayersâ€™ money to create a fund which will pay migrants to withdraw their asylum applications and leave Germany voluntarily. [The handouts will form part of a   plan to speed up the removal of rejected asylum seekers, after Tunisian migrant Anis Amri murdered a Polish lorry driver, hijacked his vehicle and drove it into a Christmas market in Berlin while awaiting deportation.  U. S. president Donald Trump told The Times that Merkel made a â€œcatastrophic mistakeâ€ when she opened the doors to an unlimited number of migrants in 2015. Her   Sigmar Gabriel, later admitted that his superior had underestimated how difficult it would be to integrate migrants on such a grand scale, and that Germany had been plunged into a kulturkampf, or â€œcultural warâ€ as a result. Germany rejected 170, 000 asylum claims in 2016 but, according to the Mail, just 26, 000 were repatriated. 55, 000 more decided to leave voluntarily  â€”   apparently leaving 81, 000 bogus applicants unaccounted for. â€œWe rely heavily on voluntary departures,â€ admitted Chancellor Merkel, who was announcing the package after falling behind the Social Democrats in polls for Germanyâ€™s upcoming elections. Martin Schulz, the former President of the European Parliament who has been nominated as the Social Democrat challenger to Merkel, said he backed the proposals to speed up deportations. Schulz has previously insisted that â€œthe people who are arriving [in Europe] are refugees who have been threatened [and] we should welcome themâ€  â€”   a statement which is at odds with the   of the European Commissionâ€™s admission that at least 60 per cent are economic migrants. As a leading figure in the European Union, Schulz was a strong supporter of the compulsory migrant quotas. These were forced through by the bloc despite strong opposition from central and eastern European   which did not agree with Germanyâ€™s unilateral decision to throw open the borders. Schulz hit out strongly at these countries in 2015, accusing them of â€œnational egotism in its purest formâ€. Polish interior minister Mariusz Blaszczak described at Schulzâ€™s words as â€œan example of German arroganceâ€."

Per affrontare la guerra finanziaria degli Stati Uniti Ã¨ urgente che i Paesi BRICS rafforzino la cooperazione nellâ€™economia e nella finanza. La Nuova banca di sviluppo dei Paesi BRICS dovrebbe aumentare il volume dei prestiti, ed anche lâ€™Accordo sul contingente di riserva. Inoltre, i Paesi BRICS dovrebbero avviare al piÃ¹ presto possibile la propria agenzia di rating. Per intensificare la coesione economica e realizzare unâ€™area di libero scambio si dovranno abbattere le barriere tariffarie ed aumentare notevolmente il commercio. In breve, se non vengono prese al piÃ¹ presto le misure del caso, i Paesi BRICS rischiano il naufragio nel prossimo uragano finanziario. Rete Voltaire | CittÃ  del Messico (Messico) | 27 ottobre 2016 franÃ§ais Ñ€ÑƒÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ EspaÃ±ol 
Il 15 e 16 ottobre si teneva nello Stato di Goa (India) lâ€™ottavo vertice dei BRICS, sigla per Brasile, Russia, India, Cina e Sud Africa. Va riconosciuto che lâ€™incontro avveniva in una situazione profondamente critica per lâ€™economia mondiale. Tuttavia, i BRICS hanno mostrato, ancora una volta, la straordinaria capacitÃ  di trasformare un brutto momento in unâ€™opportunitÃ  per approfondire i legami dal punto di vista strategico. 
Dopo che le economie BRICS hanno goduto di un â€˜etÃ  dellâ€™oroâ€™, negli ultimi anni i tassi di crescita hanno subito un drastico rallentamento. Di fronte a questa situazione difficile, ora piÃ¹ che mai i BRICS devono attingere alle istituzioni finanziarie presentate al mondo un paio di anni prima a Fortaleza (Brasile) al sesto vertice [ 1 ]. 
Lo scorso aprile, la Nuova Banca di Sviluppo effettuava il primo prestito [ 2 ] per piÃ¹ di 800 milioni di dollari, e dal 2017 si stima che i prestiti possano raggiungere i 2500 milioni [ 3 ]. Inoltre, lâ€™istituto finanziario a luglio emetteva per la prima volta â€œobbligazioni verdiâ€ in yuan per un importo pari a 450 milioni di dollari [ 4 ]. Questi strumenti finanziari, se aumentano lâ€™influenza globale della moneta cinese, finanziano grandi progetti dâ€™investimento. 
Nel frattempo, lâ€™Accordo sul contingente di riserva (CRA, nellâ€™acronimo in inglese) dal valore di 100 miliardi di dollari, Ã¨ pronto a concedere le prime linee di credito per stabilizzare la bilancia dei pagamenti dei Paesi BRICS, come annunciato dal Ministro delle Finanze indiano Arun Jaitley [ 5 ]. Ogni volta che la Federal Reserve (FED) degli Stati Uniti minaccia di aumentare il tasso dâ€™interesse dei fondi federali, innescando una nuova crisi finanziaria mondiale, Ã¨ necessario che i Paesi BRICS aumentino al piÃ¹ presto le risorse monetarie del fondo di stabilizzazione perchÃ©, in caso contrario, rischiano gravi danni per via delle speculazioni delle grandi banche dâ€™investimento. 
Allo stesso tempo, i Paesi BRICS devono aprire nuovi fronti sfidando apertamente lâ€™egemonia degli Stati Uniti e del dollaro nel sistema finanziario globale [ 6 ], non solo attraverso lo scambio in valuta locale ma, per esempio, attraverso lâ€™accumulo di riserve in yuan tra le banche centrali, soprattutto dopo che la â€˜moneta del popoloâ€™ (â€˜renminbiâ€˜ in cinese) Ã¨ stata ammessa ufficialmente, il 1Â° ottobre 2015, tra i Diritti Speciali di Prelievo, il paniere delle monete dâ€™Ã©lite creato dal Fondo monetario internazionale (FMI) alla fine degli anni 60 [ 7 ]. 
Inoltre, i Paesi BRICS possono articolare unâ€™alleanza finanziaria dai forti legami geopolitici tra America Latina, Asia, Africa e Medio Oriente. Le banche di sviluppo regionali, formate per lo piÃ¹ da Paesi periferici, potrebbero servire allo scopo: la Banca dâ€™investimento infrastrutturale asiatica (AIIB, nellâ€™acronimo in inglese), Banca dellâ€™ALBA (Alleanza Bolivariana per i Popoli della nostra America) e anche la Banca del Sud che finalmente aprirÃ  alla fine dellâ€™anno. 
Ãˆ un requisito urgente per i BRICS realizzare una propria agenzia di rating che spezzi il dominio delle statunitensi Fitch, Moodyâ€™s e Standard & Poorâ€™s [ 8 ]. Tali agenzie di rating piuttosto che effettuare valutazioni con criteri tecnici, agiscono su impulso di natura politica; cioÃ¨ da autentiche macchine da guerra: degradano le note delle obbligazioni sovrane e di conseguenza aumentano drasticamente gli oneri finanziari di Paesi come Grecia, Russia o Venezuela. 
La coesione economica Ã¨ unâ€™altra sfida importante, anche se Ã¨ chiaro che si Ã¨ progredito sostanzialmente molto negli ultimi anni: tra il 2001 e il 2015, il commercio tra i Paesi BRICS, nellâ€™ambito del commercio totale, Ã¨ raddoppiato dal 6 al 12% [ 9 ]. La Cina Ã¨ di gran lunga lâ€™economia piÃ¹ integrata nei Paesi BRICS. Al contrario, i legami tra India e Sud Africa sono marginali. Lo stesso tra Brasile e Russia.

21368,Kellyanne Conway LOSES IT On Jake Tapper When He Calls Out Trumpâ€™s Bigoted Fans (VIDEO),nan,"on October 30, 2016 2:24 pm Â· 
One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trumpâ€™s people try to say he doesnâ€™t want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trumpâ€™s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: 
â€œThere are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.â€ 
Conway immediately went on defense, saying, â€œwow.â€ Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting â€˜JEW-S-Aâ€™ at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as â€˜deplorable.â€™ She responded: 
â€œYes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe â€” I hope youâ€™ve been to Trump rallies and I hope that youâ€™ve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, heâ€™s had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.â€ 
Tapper went on to say that no, he isnâ€™t putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conwayâ€™s hand on this one: 
â€œBut without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,â€ Tapper continued. â€œHe just has. He says things like, â€œOh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.â€™ But he has never serious said, â€˜I donâ€™t want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.â€™ He has never seriously done it.â€ 
Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: 
â€œI think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that weâ€™re actually going to win in nine days because the idea that weâ€™re going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.â€ 
No, Kellyanne, itâ€™s not a sign that Trump is winning. Itâ€™s pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and itâ€™s all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because heâ€™s one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

21369,Attack on Coptic Cathedral in Cairo Kills Dozens - The New York Times,Declan Walsh and Nour Youssef,"CAIRO  â€”   A bomb ripped through a section reserved for women at Cairoâ€™s main Coptic cathedral during Sunday morning Mass, killing at least 25 people and wounding 49, mostly women and children, Egyptian state media said. The attack was the deadliest against Egyptâ€™s Christian minority in years. Video from the blast site circulating on social media showed   floors and shattered pews among the marble pillars at St. Markâ€™s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, the seat of Egyptâ€™s Orthodox Christian Church, where the blast occurred in a chapel adjacent to the main building. As security officials arrived to secure the site, angry churchgoers gathered outside and hurled insults, accusing them of negligence. â€œThere was no security at the gate,â€ one woman told reporters. â€œThey were all having breakfast inside their van. â€ A man asked, â€œYouâ€™re coming now after everything was destroyed?â€ There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the attack bore the hallmark of Islamist militants fighting President Abdel Fattah   who have previously targeted minority Christians over their perceived support for his government. It was the second major attack in the Egyptian capital in three days, marking a jarring return to violence after months of relative calm. An Islamist militant group claimed responsibility for an explosion at a security check post on Friday that killed six police officers. Mr. Sisiâ€™s strongman rule has come under economic pressure in recent months amid high inflation and a sharp drop in the value of the Egyptian pound. Threatened street protests last month did not materialize, but the surging attacks may be an attempt to stoke opposition through violence. Egyptian security officials, quoted by state media, said that an explosive device containing about 26 pounds of TNT had been placed in the chapel. It went off during Mass around 10 a. m. Most of the dead and wounded were women and children, Sherief Wadee, an assistant minister for health, said in a television interview. Mr. Sisi declared three days of mourning, state media said. Hours later, hundreds of angry worshipers gathered at the church gates to register their anger. â€œWe either avenge them or die like them,â€ they chanted. Tarek Attiya, a police spokesman, denied accusations of lax security at the church, and said the police had been operating a metal detector at the church entrance as normal. A current of fury and frustration ran through the crowd gathered at the church gates, much of it directed at Mr. Sisi and his supporters and expressed in unusually strong terms. At one point the crowd broke into chants of â€œthe people demand the downfall of the regime,â€ the signature call of the mass uprising in 2011 that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The crowd pushed out three prominent television presenters seen as sympathetic to Mr. Sisi  â€”   chanting, â€œLeave! Leave!â€  â€”   and called for the resignation of the interior minister, Magdy  . Many Egyptians reported that TV stations broadcasting pictures of the crowd had cut out audio feeds that carried the antigovernment chants. Such public anger toward the government has become rare under Mr. Sisi, who has imprisoned thousands of opposition figures, cracked down on civil society and demonstrated little tolerance for the mildest street protests. The blast coincided with a national holiday marking the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. Shrapnel pockmarked religious icons and stone walls inside the church, where witnesses gave graphic accounts of bloodied bodies strewn across the broken pews. Hundreds of people streamed into nearby hospitals, frantically seeking news of the wounded. Officials said at least six children were among the dead. Egyptâ€™s beleaguered Coptic minority, which makes up about   of the countryâ€™s roughly 90 million people, has been discriminated against for decades, and has come under violent attack since the uprising that toppled Mr. Mubarak. The leadership of the Coptic Church, under Pope Tawadros II, has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Sisi, who came to power in 2013. But that support has also made Copts a target for elements of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Islamists attacked hundreds of Coptic churches and homes in 2013, in a backlash after the security forces killed hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood demonstrators in central Cairo in August of that year. The violence smacks of sectarian prejudice because Mr. Sisiâ€™s support stems from Egyptâ€™s Muslim majority. Tensions between Christians and Muslims are highest in Minya, the province in upper Egypt that saw the worst attacks on Copts in 2013. Coptic officials in Minya have counted at least 37 attacks in the past three years, including episodes of houses set on fire and Copts being assaulted on the streets. â€œOnce again the lives of Egyptâ€™s Christian minority are dispensed with as objects within Egyptâ€™s violent and cynical battle over power,â€ said Timothy E. Kaldas, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. After the blast on Sunday, dozens of anguished Christians, some wearing black, waited for news of the wounded and the dead outside El Demerdash Hospital. Noureen Grace, her face streaked with tears, waited for the remains of her    Madeline Michelle. â€œShe was completely destroyed,â€ Ms. Grace said, describing the trauma of witnessing the mutilated body. â€œI spoke to her only yesterday. We spoke every day. â€ Moments later a   woman, still heaving with grief, walked past. â€œThey are all dead,â€ she said, declining to give her name. â€œThey were all my friends. â€"
21370,The Satanic Nature of Modern Cult-ure,noreply@blogger.com (Alexander Light),"The Satanic Nature of Modern Cult-ure Under the guise of ""secularism,"" society has been inducted into a satanic cult, Cabalism. ... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/the-satanic-nature-of-modern-cult-ure.html Under the guise of ""secularism,"" society has been inducted into a satanic cult, Cabalism. The goal is to deny man's soul connection to the Divine and reduce him to a domestic animal. ""The purpose of modern art, literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art, literature and music...""There should be a POISON symbol over the doors of our universities, theatres and art galleries. A similar warning should appear on our TV programs, music and videos.In the 1920's, the Comintern decided that the West could be conquered by first subverting its cultural institutions--family, education, religion, art, mass media and government.They have largely succeeded. While maintaining their familiar format, they have subtly changed the content. It's like lacing a bottle of aspirin with arsenic. We are noticing that our political and cultural leaders are mostly cowards, dupes, traitors, crooks, opportunists and impostors.Our failure to combat Communism is due to misunderstanding its real nature. Communism is a facade for a satanic cult ( Cabalism , Freemasonry ) empowered by Masonic Jewish international bankers. It is designed to absorb the world's wealth, and eventually to reduce and enslave the human race. The 5-pointed Red Star of Communism is also the symbol of Satanism .A demonic virus, Communism has morphed into countless forms, hoodwinking more people than ever.Western Civilization is built on Christianity, the premise that God is real, indeed the Ultimate Reality, spiritual in character. Through man's Divine soul, an individual can discern the God's Will without mediation from a worldly authority. This is why the bankers hate Christianity.God is the Truth, Love, Beauty and Goodness to which we all aspire. An immanent Moral Order precludes a small clique monopolizing the world's wealth and enslaving its population. So, the bankers must destroy our belief in God by promoting Darwinism, Existentialism etc. They create war, depression and terror so we will accept their New World Order . THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL In his brilliant essay, "" The Frankfurt School and Political Correctness "" Michael Minnichino reveals that most of the fashionable intellectual and artistic movements in the 20th century, still in vogue today, were actually inspired by thinkers who were Comintern (Communist International) agents financed by the central bankers. Some of them actually worked for Soviet Intelligence (NKVD) right into the 1960's.He writes: ""The task [of the Frankfurt School] was first to undermine the Judeo-Christian legacy through an ""abolition of culture"" ...and second, to determine new cultural forms which would increase the alienation of the population, thus creating a ""new barbarism."" ""... The purpose of modern art, literature and music must be to destroy the uplifting potential of art, literature and music... ""Funds came from ""various German and American universities, the Rockefeller Foundation , the American Jewish Committee, several American intelligence services...""This subversive movement ""represents almost the entire theoretical basis of all the politically correct aesthetic trends which now plague our universities."" They are associated with Post Modernism, Feminism, Cultural Studies, Deconstructionism, Semiotics, etc.Their net effect is to divorce us from truth, social cohesion and our cultural heritage. They assert that reality is unknowable and that writers and artists are just depicting their own subjective reality. For example, postmodernist Hayden White writes, ""historical narratives are verbal fictions, the contents of which are more invented than found...truth and reality are primarily authoritarian weapons of our times."" In other words, we cannot know what happened in the past (which is exactly what they want.)Postmodernism is part of the authoritarian agenda. Similarly the Frankfurt School championed the notion that ""authoritarianism"" is caused by religion, male leadership, marriage and family, when these things actually uphold society.As far as the humanities are concerned, universities are enemy territory and professors usually are obstacles to genuine learning. THE ANCIENT CONSPIRACY Communism manifests an ancient Luciferian Jewish revolt against God and man. The Jewish Pharisees rejected Christ because he taught that God is Love and all men are equal in the sight of God.""The advent of Christ was a national catastrophe for the Jewish people, especially for the leaders,"" Leon de Poncins writes. ""Until then they alone had been the Sons of the Covenant; they had been its sole high priests and beneficiaries....""He continues: ""The irreducible antagonism with which Judaism has opposed Christianity for 2000 years is the key and mainspring of modern subversion... [The Jew] championed reason against the mythical world of the spirit ...he was the doctor of unbelief; all those who were mentally in revolt came to him either secretly or in broad daylight..."" (Judaism and the Vatican, pp.111-113.)In addition to Jewish Cabalism, Freemasonry has been the bankers' tool. It was instrumental in the destruction of the Christian monarchies in Germany, Austria and Russia and the decline of the Catholic Church. This is also the view revealed in The Red Symphony .In his Encyclical Humanum Genus (1884) Pope Leo XIII wrote that the ultimate aim of Freemasonry is ""to uproot completely the whole religious and moral order of the world, which has been brought into existence by Christianity... This will mean that the foundation and the laws of the new structure of society will be drawn from pure naturalism.""Again Pope Leo XIII said: ""Freemasonry is the permanent personification of the Revolution; it constitutes a sort of society in reverse whose aim is to exercise an occult overlordship upon society as we know it, and whose sole raison d'etre consists of waging war against God and his Church."" (De Poncins, Freemasonry and the Vatican , p. 45)De Poncins cites an article that appeared in 1861 in a Parisian Jewish Review La Verite Israelite: ""But the spirit of Freemasonry is that of Judaism in its most fundamental beliefs; its ideas are Judaic, its language is Judaic, its very organization, almost, is Judaic... ""De Poncins writes that the goal of both Freemasonry and Judaism is the unification of the world under Jewish law. ( Freemasonry and the Vatican , p. 76) CONCLUSION Just as we need healthy food and exercise, our mind and soul needs to be nourished by truth and beauty. We need to see life portrayed honestly, with the real forces identified. Instead, we are deliberately deceived and degraded by a small financial elite with a diabolical plan. White stallions (our souls) are fed a diet of sawdust.Whether it's school or mass media, we are bombarded with propaganda designed to produce alienation and dysfunction. We must protect ourselves from this poison before it is too late.The good news is that modern culture has been exposed as a long-term Illuminati psy-op designed to demoralize us. It will fail.

21371,Roy Cooper Holds Thin Lead Over Gov. Pat McCrory in North Carolina - The New York Times,Richard Fausset,"RALEIGH, N. C.  â€”   Roy Cooper, a Democrat, held a   lead on Thursday in North Carolinaâ€™s bitterly contested race for governor. If it holds, it would be a rare bright spot for his party this week, one that has much to do with Mr. Cooperâ€™s call for repealing a state law limiting transgender bathroom access that has subjected North Carolina to a gale of international criticism, boycotts and cancellations. Yet many here are now predicting that the contentious law, which catalyzed a national debate over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, is unlikely to be repealed even if Mr. Cooper becomes governor. On Thursday, State Representative Rodney W. Moore was one of a number of Democratic lawmakers who predicted that Republicans here in the capitol would have little reason to dump the law, commonly known as House Bill 2, or H. B. 2, even if Mr. Cooper were elected. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican seeking his second term, has refused to concede until thousands of   and provisional ballots are counted by elections boards in each of the stateâ€™s 100 counties. That process is set to conclude on Nov. 18. Mr. McCrory was widely criticized for having signed the law. Mr. Moore noted that Donald J. Trump, the Republican   won North Carolina by nearly four percentage points in Tuesdayâ€™s election. Senator Richard M. Burr, a Republican, cruised to   by an even greater margin, in a race against a Democratic challenger, Deborah Ross, that had been billed as one of the nationâ€™s closest. And Republican legislators on Tuesday maintained their supermajorities in the State House and Senate. â€œTheyâ€™re going to feel empowered that their agenda is working, so itâ€™s going to be very hard to imagine them taking up H. B. 2 to overturn it or modify it,â€ Mr. Moore said of Republicans on Thursday. â€œI donâ€™t see them chomping at the bit or singing kumbaya to change it. â€ Republican leaders of the state legislature could not be reached for comment. Mr. Cooper, North Carolinaâ€™s attorney general, declared victory early Wednesday morning, when tallies from the stateâ€™s 2, 704 precincts showed him leading by just less than 5, 000 votes. For now, the only thing certain about the outcome is that lawyers from both sides will be closely monitoring the county boards as they determine which of the more than 50, 000 provisional ballots should be deemed legitimate. Mr. McCroryâ€™s campaign announced on Wednesday that it was establishing a   fund in preparation for an â€œongoing legal battleâ€ over the vote tally. â€œNo one knows for sure the outcome of the election, and tens of thousands of ballots remain outstanding and not yet counted,â€ Jason Torchinsky, the fundâ€™s chief lawyer, said in a statement. Chris LaCivita, the McCrory campaignâ€™s strategist, said in a separate statement that the campaign also had â€œgrave concerns over potential irregularitiesâ€ regarding 90, 000 votes in Durham County. Still, a number of political observers here said that Mr. Cooper had the better chance of winning.   absentee voters traditionally tend to be Republicans, while voters who file provisional ballots tend to be Democrats. And though the exact number of   ballots was not yet known, they were expected to be outnumbered by provisional ballots. â€œI would not be surprised that Cooper keeps the lead, or has some extra cushion built into itâ€ at the conclusion of the   process, said J. Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury, N. C. If either man is trailing by fewer than 10, 000 votes after Nov. 18, he may demand a recount. Whether Mr. Cooper wins or not, his showing was exceptional, given the shellacking other Democrats received on Tuesday, both in North Carolina and nationally. The outcry over H. B. 2 was widely considered to be one of the main reasons for his success. The law, signed by Mr. McCrory in March, prohibits local governments from passing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and it requires that people in government buildings use the restrooms that correspond with their gender at birth. Mr. McCrory has argued that the law was necessary to ensure privacy, and others said it would protect innocent people from sexual predators. Gay rights advocates saw the bathroom provision as an attack on transgender people. As part of the backlash against the law, planned job expansions, concerts and major sporting events have been canceled. During the campaign, Mr. Cooper argued that Mr. McCrory had harmed the stateâ€™s reputation and economy by signing the bill. It was a message that was embraced even by some Trump supporters, and it was a likely reason Mr. Cooper and Mr. Trump found success in some of the same parts of North Carolina. One was coastal New Hanover County, home to the city of Wilmington. The area has seen a dip in its   film industry recently, a likely result of the legislatureâ€™s decision not to renew a state tax credit for film, television and commercial production. But there is also a suspicion in Wilmington that Hollywood has grown leery of North Carolina because of H. B. 2. Jason Rosin, a business agent with Local 491 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union representing film workers in Wilmington, said that some of his members were motivated to vote for Mr. Cooper out of concerns about H. B. 2â€™s effect on the industry  â€”   even as they voted for Mr. Trump. â€œI believe that in the Cooper race, they voted for their economic â€ Mr. Rosin said."

21373,Shia vs. Sunni: The Schism Western Politicians Donâ€™t Understand and Wonâ€™t Discuss - Breitbart,John Hayward,"Western politicians rarely acknowledge the schism between Shia and Sunni Islam. There is nothing remotely comparable to this schism in any other religion in the modern world. [The   conflict defines the political structure of the Middle East, from the international rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia to the internal politics of Muslim nations. And yet, Western politicians, eager to portray Islam as a â€œreligion of peace,â€ speak of Muslims as homogenous.   At the hard core of political correctness, Islam is treated more like a race than a religion, a monolithic ethnic bloc like â€œHispanicsâ€ or â€œAsians. â€ Both of those groups are, in turn, diverse populations absurdly squeezed into monoliths for the convenience of   political strategists. In truth, there are Shiite Muslims who do not think Sunnis count as Muslim at all, and vice versa. Adherents of the more extreme sects within the Sunni and Shia schools view moderate followers of the same basic tradition as apostates. The   Divide, Few Western politicians know the first thing about the   rift, which flows from a doctrinal dispute that might seem trivial to modern outsiders. When Mohammed died in the 7th Century, there was a profound disagreement among the early followers of Islam about who should succeed him as leader.  The heart of the   conflict is that the Sunnis thought the new leader or â€œcaliphâ€ should be elected and chose Mohammedâ€™s close friend Abu Bakr. The leader of the Islamic State, who styles himself as â€œcaliphâ€ or ruler of all true Muslims, calls himself â€œAbu Bakr  â€ in homage to the first caliph. His real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim  . The dissident group we now know as Shiites insisted that only a blood relative of Mohammed was fit to lead, rallying behind Ali bin Abu Talib, who was both Mohammedâ€™s cousin and   . Ali actually took a turn as caliph after Abu Bakr died, so it would be more precise to say the enduring rift within Islam was caused by Aliâ€™s assumption of leadership and the argument over his successor. A great deal of   tribal politics swirled around this conflict, making it more complex than any brief summary could capture. Among other factors, there was Islamâ€™s development into a warrior religion, leading to clan rivalries and vicious arguments over plunder. Personal loyalties to Ali or his rivals played a role as well. But this is a religious schism, not a matter of stimulating debate between historians. Shiites believe stealing leadership away from the lineal descendants of Mohammed was apostasy, a sin against the true faith.  Ali was assassinated, stabbed in the forehead with a poison sword while praying. Modern Shiites still make a pilgrimage to the mosque where they believe he died and is entombed, located in what is now Iraq. The city where it is located, Najaf, has been the scene of much sectarian bloodshed. The Sunni government of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein enraged a generation of Shiites by abusing the Imam Ali mosque. Ali did not win the title of â€œcaliphâ€ in an election, either. Abu Bakr only reigned for a few years before he died. Ali got the job after Abu Bakrâ€™s second successor, Caliph Uthman, was killed by his own troops in the Muslim holy city of Medina. One reason the   divide is so bitter is that Sunnis of the time were furious at Ali for accepting the title of caliph instead of punishing Uthmanâ€™s killers.  Followers of Uthman thought Ali committed acts of blasphemy and arrogance against true Islam, and Aliâ€™s followers felt the same way about the Sunni elite. A major point of contention was, and remains, whether Ali swore and broke a binding oath of loyalty to the Sunni hierarchy and the caliphs that came before him.  This is not a minor dispute over the life and times of a   historical personage, but a profound question of religious legitimacy.   Iran still believes its theocracy has rightful authority over Islam under the Shiite model of descent from Mohammed, for example. One of the candidates in the recent Iranian presidential election, cleric Ebrahim Raisi, wears a black turban to signify he is a sayed, a descendant of Mohammed. Raisi choose green as his campaign color because he wanted to take the color back from the secular â€œGreen Movementâ€ demonstrators and restore its â€œreal meaningâ€ as the color of â€œthe revolutionary grandsons of the Prophet. â€ Those grandsons attempted a revolution against the early Sunni caliphs. They did not die of old age. Sunni and Shia share many essential beliefs, but even their shared beliefs can be sources of tension. Both Sunnis and Shiites make pilgrimages to the holy cities in Saudi Arabia. Iran frequently castigates the Sunni Saudis over their management of the hajj pilgrimage, alleging discrimination against Shiites along with poor event management. The Saudis supply plenty of poor event management to complain about. The royal family of Jordan is seen by some analysts as key to bridging the   divide, because the Hashemite ruling dynasty of Sunni Jordan claims direct descent from Mohammedâ€™s family, satisfying the Shiite criteria for authentic leadership of Islam. Unfortunately, this also means the Jordanian regime gets to enjoy the violent hatred of both Sunni and Shiite extremists. The Sunni Islamic State infamously burned a captured Jordanian pilot alive in a cage and spread the image across the Internet as one of its favorite propaganda videos. Jordanian officials have nevertheless said they regard the Islamic Republic of Iran as a greater threat to their security than ISIS or other Sunni extremists.    Minorities, Syriaâ€™s dictator, Bashar Assad, is a member of the small Alawite subsect of Shia Islam. Alawites only make up about ten percent of Syriaâ€™s population, but the Assad regime, under both Bashar and his father Hafez, consolidated power by appointing Alawites to high government positions. The vast majority of the Syrian population is not Alawite, or even Shiite, but Sunni. Bashar Assad frequently responds to criticism of his brutality by pointing to his history of protecting Syrian religious minorities, including Christians, and noting he belongs to a minority himself. What is the difference between an Alawite and a Shiite? There are many minor differences in custom and tradition, but the major difference concerns Imam Ali. Recall that Shiites revere Ali as the rightful leader of Islam who should have succeeded Mohammed, and was divinely martyred in death, while Sunnis regard him as a traitor. The Alawites believe he was God incarnate. Some Sunni religious leaders consider them â€œworse infidels than Christians and Jews,â€ as one prominent cleric of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood put it in 2013 when calling for a Sunni jihad against them. Another branch of Islam that often suffers discrimination and violence from other Muslims is the Sufi sect. The Sufis are neither Sunni nor Shiite  â€”   or they might say they are both, since both Sunni and Shiite Islam have Sufi chapters. This makes them an abused minority in both Shiite nations like Iran and Sunni countries like Egypt. Sufism is more defined by its approach than specific doctrines, unlike the way Sunni and Shia or Shia and Alawite are distinguished. Modern Sufi have a reputation for gentleness and moderation, although they were a formidable military force in the past. The famed â€œwhirling dervishâ€ swordsmen of antiquity were a Sufi invention. Dervishes still whirl, but now the practice is seen as performance art or a form of moving meditation, like tai chi. Sufi are generally less interested in strict interpretations of the Koran and Islamic sharia law, which makes them despised by hardcore Islamist sects. They are sometimes accused of diluting pure Islam with mystical   or serving as agents for Western powers, seeking to subvert and â€œtameâ€ true Islam as part of a Western imperialist agenda. None of these branches of Islam are themselves homogeneous. There are dozens of different Sufi orders, for instance. Some of them are militant or political in nature, contrary to the general impression of Sufis as peaceable mystics. Sunni Minorities, A school of Sunni Islam that has become increasingly important to American and European politics is Hizmet, a highly organized group founded and led by an imam named Fethullah Gulen. The government of Turkey sees Hizmet as far too organized, prosecuting it (literally) as a vast criminal conspiracy that attempted to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last year. The Turkish government refers to Hizmet as â€œFETO,â€ an acronym for â€œFethullah Terrorist Organization. â€ Turkeyâ€™s diplomatic relations with both Europe and the United States have been rocked by its pursuit of Hizmet and Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania.  Sunni Islam also includes a movement known as the Salafi, the Islamic fundamentalists. Salafists believe Mohammed, and to a lesser extent his first two generations of descendants, were perfect human beings who should be emulated in every way, including dress and personal hygiene. Salafism includes its own, even more primitive and regressive   including the Wahabbi Islam promoted by Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Stateâ€™s apocalyptic belief system.  â€œPrimitiveâ€ is not a pejorative term  â€”   Wahabbi Muslims literally embrace the primitive lifestyle of the 7th Century, when Mohammed lived. Their hostility to modernity is one of their defining attributes. Another is their hostility to all other variations of Islam, most definitely including Shiites. The rapid spread of Salafist beliefs through   overt and covert networks  â€”   Salafist madrassas, and agents of influence sent to infiltrate more moderate Islamic schools  â€”   is one of the major security concerns of our age, for those analysts and officers who have not been intimidated out of discussing it. Islam and the West, That brings us back to the problem of sterilizing Islam by treating it as homogenous. The Sunni Muslim Brotherhood has been considered for designation as a terrorist organization by the U. S. government, but its defenders say not even the Brotherhood is a single entity. They insist it has many chapters, many of which cannot be fairly regarded as extremists or terrorists. To be sure, not all Muslims feel any of this doctrinal animosity. It would be a foolâ€™s game to say â€œmost doâ€ or â€œmost donâ€™t,â€ given the size of the global Muslim population, the differences between Muslims of different nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, and the effects of emigration and assimilation. In his speech in Saudi Arabia, President Trump observed that Muslims are often the victims of Islamic terrorism: In sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim. This is true, but also an incomplete picture of the problem. Muslims abuse and kill each other over doctrinal conflicts on a horrifying scale. Most of that violence and oppression is not â€œterrorism. â€ It comes from military conflicts and government crackdowns on religious minorities. Sectarian strife is one of the reasons why so many Syrian rebel groups viewed favorably by the West are willing to ally with   and other terrorist organizations. In Iraq, there are Sunnis living in territory captured by ISIS that openly welcomed their ghastly conquerors, or were at least reluctant to work with the Iraqi government, because they distrusted the    Iraqi government, and were terrified of the   Shiite militias operating in the region. In Bahrain, the government is under fire for suppressing the Shiite majority in its population, with five dead in a recent police raid against a Shiite community. The Bahraini monarchy, in turn, credibly accuses Iran of seeking to destabilize the country by exacerbating   tensions. Bahrainâ€™s Sunnis fear they would be brutalized on an epic scale if Shiites overthrow the government. This all becomes Americaâ€™s problem because our national interests in the Middle East are tangled inexorably with the   schism. Bahrain, for example, is the strategically vital home to the U. S. 5th Fleet. Shiites resent America for supporting the Sunni monarchy. American military planners are understandably nervous about the prospect of renting a base for the 5th Fleet from a   Bahrain that would be a Shiite satellite of Iran, to say nothing of the cascade effect such a religious war would have on other Sunni allies in the region."
21374,Diabetes and Your Diet: The Low-Carb Debate - The New York Times,Gina Kolata,"A few years ago, Richard Kahn, the   chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, was charged with organizing a committee to prescribe a diet plan for people with diabetes. He began by looking at the evidence for different diets, asking which, if any, best controlled diabetes. â€œWhen you look at the literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak,â€ Dr. Kahn said in a recent interview. Studies tended to be short term, diets unsustainable, differences among them clinically insignificant. The only thing that really seemed to help people with diabetes was weight loss  â€”   and for weight loss, there is no magic diet. But people want diet advice, Dr. Kahn reasoned, and the association really should say something about diets. So it, like the National Institutes of Health, went with the Department of Agricultureâ€™s food pyramid. Why? â€œItâ€™s a diet for all America,â€ Dr. Kahn said. â€œIt has lots of fruits and vegetables and a reasonable amount of fat. â€ That advice, though, recently came under attack in a New York Times commentary written by Sarah Hallberg, an osteopath at a weight loss clinic in Indiana, and Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the obesity weight loss program at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School. There is a diet that helps with diabetes, the two doctors said: one that restricts  â€”   or, according to Dr. Hallberg, severely restricts  â€”   carbohydrates. â€œIf the goal is to get patients off their medications, including insulin, and resolve rather than just control their diabetes, significant carb restriction is by far the best nutrition plan,â€ Dr. Hallberg said in an email. â€œThis would include elimination of grains, potatoes and sugars and all processed foods. There is a significant and ever growing body of literature that supports this method. â€ She is in private practice at Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital and is medical director of a   developing   medical interventions. But there are no large and rigorous studies showing that   diets offer an advantage, and, in fact, there is not even a consensus on the definition of a   diet  â€”   it can vary from doctor to doctor. â€œThere have been debates for literally the whole history of diabetes about which kind of diet is best,â€ said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, chief academic officer at Joslin, and no relation to Dr. Richard Kahn. But, he said, â€œthe answer isnâ€™t so straightforward. â€ In support of a diet like Dr. Hallbergâ€™s, there is one recent   study, by Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleagues, involving 17 overweight and obese men, none of whom had diabetes. They stayed in a clinical center where they ate carefully controlled diets. The researchers asked what would happen if calories were kept constant but the carbohydrate composition of a diet varied from high to very low. The answer was that insulin secretion dropped 50 percent with the very low carbohydrate diet, meaning that much less insulin was required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. â€œSince diabetes results when the body canâ€™t produce enough insulin, perhaps it is a good idea to reduce the amount of insulin it needs by eating    diets,â€ Dr. Hall said. Some   studies, though, failed to show that   diets benefited glucose control. Even if diets are effective in the short term, Dr. Hall said, â€œthe difficulty is adhering to the diet over the long term. â€ In an analysis of weight loss diets (not specifically for diabetics) published this summer, he and Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa wrote: â€œDiet adherence is so challenging that it is poor even in   studies where all food is provided. When diets are prescribed, adherence is likely to diminish over the long term despite   to the contrary. â€ But   studies of just a few weeks, which constitute the bulk of the diet studies, can be misleading, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn. â€œIn the short term, the   diet sometimes does better on glycemic control,â€ he said. â€œBut as time progresses, the difference mostly disappears. What counts is which diet helps most with   weight loss. â€ The reason the advantage sometimes seen with a   diet tends to vanish, Dr. C. Ronald Kahn added, is probably a mix of people failing to adhere to the diets and their bodiesâ€™ adjusting to them. Another issue with   diets, researchers said, is the question of what will happen to overall health if diabetics actually follow the diet for years or decades. (Heart attacks are the major killer of people with diabetes.) Insulin levels may be better, but, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, a director of Columbia Universityâ€™s Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, â€œeffects of a   diet on lipoproteins and vascular biology could offset such a â€˜benefit. â€™â€ In other words, it is not clear if a lower insulin level would translate into fewer heart attacks. Dr. Hamdy, whose recommended   diet is less restrictive than the one Dr. Hallberg suggests, reports that many patients in his clinic have been able to stay with the diet for as long as five years, losing weight and keeping it off. He presented his study at the 2015 annual conference of the American Diabetes Association and has submitted it for publication. It involved 129 patients. Half were able to lose weight and keep it off, and those who did maintained an average weight loss of 9. 5 percent. Their diabetes was much improved. It is impossible, Dr. Hamdy said, to separate weight loss from the dietâ€™s effects on diabetes because people following such a diet  â€”   which limits but does not forbid things like breads, pasta and rice  â€”   also lose weight. But multiple studies have found that when it comes to weight loss  â€”   the only proven way to help with blood sugar control over the long term  â€”   there is no difference among diets that restrict calories, fat or carbohydrates. Experts like Dr. David Nathan, the director of the diabetes center and clinical research center at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, advise dieting for people with diabetes. But, he said, â€œwhen we advise people to be on diets, the major goal is to lose weight. â€ What matters the most for controlling diabetes, Dr. Nathan said, â€œis how much weight you lose. â€"
21375,"Ever a Showman, Donald Trump Keeps Washington Guessing - The New York Times",Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman,"WASHINGTON  â€”   The speech was written, the rollout strategy was set. And then President Trump began talking and the plan went out the window. Unless that was the plan all along. When Mr. Trump sat down with television anchors at the White House for an    lunch on Tuesday, he was supposed to preview his first address to Congress. Instead, he suddenly opened the door to an immigration bill that would potentially let millions of undocumented immigrants stay in the country legally. Such legislation from the â€œbuild the wallâ€ president would roil politics in the capital, and Mr. Trump told the anchors that nothing like that was actually in the speech as it was then drafted. But he turned to aides and suggested that maybe they should include it. After the lunch was over, aides rushed off to alert their colleagues, including Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller, the architects of the presidentâ€™s immigration crackdown. Once again, the unlikeliest of presidents had torn up the script and thrown his young administration into upheaval. Once again, Washington was left trying to fathom what his strategy was. Was it mad genius, an improvisational leader proposing a     move to overhaul immigration after making a point of deporting â€œbad hombresâ€? Or was it simply madness, an undisciplined political amateur unable to resist telling guests what he thinks they want to hear even at the expense of his own political base? In the end, he did not include it in the speech. And yet, rising to the occasion, Mr. Trump on Tuesday night sounded as presidential as he ever has since taking office. He invoked Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D. Eisenhower, heralded Black History Month, condemned   vandalism, celebrated American entrepreneurs like Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, and promised a â€œrenewal of the American spirit. â€ He followed the written text on the teleprompters more closely than any major speech of his presidency. Still, the paradox remained. He called for working â€œpast the differences of party,â€ just hours after he called Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader from California, â€œincompetent. â€ He declared that â€œthe time for trivial fights is behind usâ€ just weeks after engaging in a public Twitter war with Arnold Schwarzenegger over the ratings for â€œCelebrity Apprentice. â€ And then there was that immigration trial balloon. If nothing else, Donald Trump the showman kept the attention right where he wanted it  â€”   squarely on himself. By the time he took the rostrum in the House chamber on Tuesday night for the functional equivalent of a State of the Union address, he had generated considerable suspense around what he would actually say and how it would be received. He boasted of deporting â€œgang members, drug dealers and criminals,â€ saying that â€œbad ones are going out as I speak. â€ He introduced guests in the first ladyâ€™s box whose families had suffered at the hands of criminals in the country illegally. But he talked about â€œreforming our system of legal immigration,â€ saying as he has before that the United States should base its admission of foreigners on merit. â€œI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible as long as we focus on the following goals,â€ he added, â€œto improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nationâ€™s security and to restore respect for our laws. â€ Whether this was all an intentional distraction remained unclear by the time he wrapped up and headed back down Pennsylvania Avenue. This is, after all, a White House that revels in what its current occupants refer to as the â€œhead fake,â€ where the president gives the impression of moving one way when he is really moving in a completely different direction, even diverting attention from one controversy by creating another. That leaves allies and adversaries alike scratching their heads about what Mr. Trump really believes. In private discussions since the inauguration, a mystified Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader from Kentucky, has said that Mr. Trump appears uncertain of precisely where he stands on a number of critical issues. Thus, aides, activists, lobbyists and lawmakers search for ways to influence a malleable president, who sometimes plays along with his teamâ€™s desire to confuse and distract, but who is also prone to spouting out    ideas depending on his audience. Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers have said privately that they wanted this opening speech to Congress to be more optimistic than the address he delivered at his inauguration in January, an   jeremiad against what he called â€œAmerican carnageâ€ and the establishment he blamed for it. Mr. Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka Trump has privately expressed concern about the harsh tone of some of her fatherâ€™s rhetoric over many months. No president in modern times had shown up for his first speech to Congress with approval ratings so low  â€”   just 42 percent in the latest Gallup poll. His 40 days of careening from one crisis to another, many of them   had sowed deep doubts about his leadership not only among Democrats and independents but even among many Republicans. His challenge for this address was to move beyond these moments and establish himself as a president. Immigration has been one area where he was evidently still trying to calibrate. After all, Mr. Trump was not always so strident on the issue. After the 2012 election, he denounced Mitt Romney for supporting what he called â€œâ€ calling it â€œa crazy policyâ€ that cost Mr. Romney the Hispanic vote. The Democrats, he said then, did not have a policy â€œbut what they did have going for them is they werenâ€™t meanspirited about it. â€ The session with the television anchors started out as a nod to tradition by a president who has broken so many. Like his predecessors on the day of a State of the Union address, Mr. Trump hosted the journalists for what was supposed to be an unrecorded lunch to give them a sense of what he would tell Congress. But the conversation took a surprising turn when some of the anchors asked about his efforts to deport many of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Without being prompted, Mr. Trump then raised the idea of legislation, noting that there had not been any comprehensive law passed by Congress on the subject since Ronald Reaganâ€™s amnesty program in the 1980s. He told the anchors it was time for a bill that would grant legal status to many of those in the country illegally as long as both sides compromised, similar to the legislation sought but never passed by George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Mr. Trump said he recognized that it would cause him political problems with his conservative base voters, according to people in the room, but added that he thought he could keep them happy since they had stuck with him throughout last yearâ€™s Republican primaries. When Mr. Trump offered the idea, he let the word â€œcompromiseâ€ hang in the air, gauging the reaction. He then turned to Hope Hicks, his director of strategic communications, and suggested that the thought could be added to his speech. As Mr. Trumpâ€™s words settled over the State Dining Room, the presidentâ€™s aides glanced at one another. They moved quickly to alert Mr. Bannon and Mr. Miller, two of the main keepers of Mr. Trumpâ€™s address before Congress. That the proposal did not ultimately make it into the speech may speak to the influence of Mr. Bannonâ€™s wing. But the town was confused and off balance, just the way Mr. Trump likes it."

21377,"India's Stonehenge: 7,000-Year-Old Megalithic Site is Oldest Observatory in South Asia",noreply@blogger.com (Alexander Light),"Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/indias-stonehenge-7000-year-old.html A remarkable 7,000-year-old megalithic site that served as an astronomical observatory has been found in Muduma village in Telangana, India. The discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological findings in India over the last few decades.According to Times of India , the team of archeologists described it as ""the only megalithic site in India, where a depiction of a star constellation has been identified."" The ancient observatory dates to 5,000 BC and the researchers believe that it is the earliest astronomical observatory discovered in India and perhaps even in the whole of South Asia.The site consists of around 80 huge menhirs (standing stones), which are 3.5 â€“ 4 meters tall. There are also about 2000 alignment stones, which are 30-60cm tall.According to experts, no other excavation site in India has so many menhirs concentrated in such a small area. The maximum concentration of menhirs is located in the central portion of the monument.One of the surprising details discovered at the site is a depiction of the constellation known as Ursa Major, which is formed from small cup-sized pits carved into a standing stone. The group of about 30 cup-marks were arranged in the same shape in which Ursa Major can be observed in the night sky with the naked eye. The carving depicts not only the prominent seven starts, but also the peripheral stars too. The large standing stones that form an observatory in Telangana, India ( Satya Vijayi ) Moreover, as ArcheoFeed.com reported: an ""imaginary line drawn through the top two stars point to pole star or the North Star.""Researchers believe that the site still holds many secrets. The next planned research will take a place in December led by archeologists from Korea.Numerous prehistoric observatories have already been discovered around the world, including Peru, Britain and Armenia. Thousands of years ago people were trying to understand the sky and were often using their observations to make predictions for agricultural and ceremonial purposes. The site Zorats Karer from Armenia dates back to the same period as the observatory from India. The constellation Ursa Major as it can be seen by the unaided eye ( public domain ) As Natalia Klimczak from Ancient Origins wrote :â€œZorats Karer is also known as Carahunge, Karahunj, Qarahunj. It is located in an area of around 7 hectares and covers the site nearby the Dar river canyon, close to the city of Sisan. The ancient site is often called the ""A rmenian Stonehenge ,"" but the truth of what it is may be even more fascinating. Related: Stonehenge is 5,000 Years Older Than Previously Thought According to researchers, Zorats Karer could be among the world's oldest astronomical observatories, and is at least 3,500 years older than British Stonehenge. The site was rediscovered in 1984 by a team led by researcher Onik Khnkikyan. After a few months of work, Khnkikyan concluded that the site of Zorats Karer must have been an observatory. Moreover, with time, Armenian archeologists, astronomers and astrophysicists found that there were at least two other ancient sites important for prehistoric astronomy in the vicinity: Angeghakot and Metzamor. A general view of the Karahunj site near Sisian, Southern Armenia. ( CC BY-SA 4.0 ) In 1994, Zorats Karer was extensively analyzed by Professor Paris Herouni, a member of the Armenian National Academy of Science and President of the Radio Physics Research Institute in Yerevan. His expeditions revealed a great deal of fascinating information about the site. First of all, his team counted 223 stones, of which 84 were found to have holes.They measured the longitude, latitude and the magnetic deviation of the site. The researchers also created a topographical map of the monumental megalithic construction, which became the basis of further work. Finally, the main treasure of the site was unearthed â€“ a collection of many impressive and unique astronomical objects. The researchers realized that several stones were used to make observations of the sun, moon and stars. They were located according to knowledge about the rising, culmination moments, and setting of the sun, moon and specific stars. The stones are basalt, somewhat protected by moss but smoothed by the rain and wind and full of holes and erosion. Many of the stones were damaged over time.In ancient times, the stones were shaped and arranged in what are known as the north and south arms, the central circle, the north-eastern alley, the separate standing system of circles and the chord. The stones are between 0.5 and 3 meters tall and weigh up to 10 tons. Some of them are related to burial cists.""

21378,Report: Michigan State Bans Whiteboards to Prevent Spread of Racist Messages - Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,"Administrators at Michigan State University have introduced a policy which will prevent students from hanging white boards outside of their dorm rooms in an effort to prevent racist messages from appearing on dormitory walls. [The new policy, which will go into effect in Fall 2017, will prevent students from putting up white boards outside of their dorm rooms in an effort to curb issues with bullying on campus.  â€œIn any given month, there are several incidents like this.

21379,"Pope Francis Takes Backhanded Swipe At Trump, & Those Who 'Raise Walls, & Label People'",Natalie Thongrit,"0 129 
On Saturday, during a ceremony welcoming 17 new cardinals into the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis warned attendees about the divisiveness that he feels is spreading throughout the church. The Associated Press reports that Pope Francis cautioned against the â€œvirus of polarization,â€ telling the new group of cardinals, â€œwe are not immune from this.â€ 
During his speech, Pope Francis specifically issued a warning about â€œour pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose, and condemnâ€ and those who â€œraise walls, build barriers, and label people.â€ He also encouraged those in attendance to not be so quick to deem those who are different from them an enemy or a threat. 
â€˜We see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. 
â€˜The virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.â€™ 
Pope Francis never called out Donald Trump by name; however, it seems to be more than a mere coincidence that he delivered a speech about accepting immigrants shortly after the United States electorate chose as their leader for the next four years a man who has proposed mass deportation and the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
This is not the first time that the Pope has spoken out against Donald Trump and his campaign promises, either. In February of this year, when asked about Trumpâ€™s proposed border wall, he said , â€œa person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.â€ 
At least one of the newly appointed cardinals has views similar to Pope Francisâ€™s when it comes to immigration. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin, who was in the news recently for helping to resettle Syrian refugees despite now vice president-elect Mike Penceâ€™s best efforts to block aid to and limit the number of Syrian refugees in Indiana. 
Tobin recently addressed Trumpâ€™s victory, saying that, under him, the priority of settling immigrants and refugees â€œis going to be challenging.â€ He added, though, that he believes â€œthe ethical reflection of a nation isnâ€™t reduced to the governmentâ€ and said that he has â€œa lot of faith in the American people.â€

21381,New Climate-Friendlier Coolant Has a Catch: Itâ€™s Flammable - The New York Times,Danny Hakim,"LONDON  â€”   Rajiv Singh started thinking about how to do his part to fight global warming 15 years ago. Dr. Singh, a scientist at Honeywellâ€™s lab in Buffalo, began running computer models of tens of thousands of molecular combinations. He was seeking a better refrigerant, one of the most vexing chemicals for the environment. Refrigerants cool homes, cars and buildings but also warm the planet at a far higher rate than carbon dioxide. Dr. Singh was searching for one stable enough to be useful but that degraded quickly so it did not linger to trap heat in the atmosphere. â€œYou have to hit the chemistry books,â€ he said in a recent interview. As product names go,   the refrigerant he played a crucial role in developing, does not roll off the tongue. But it is one of the most important alternatives to hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which have long been used in   and refrigerators and which contribute greatly to climate change. On Oct. 15, in Kigali, Rwanda, more than 170 countries reached an agreement as part of the Montreal Protocol to curb the use of HFCs. But Dr. Singhâ€™s new coolant is also controversial, with critics questioning its safety and viewing it as the latest attempt by large chemical companies to play the regulatory system to their advantage.   is already becoming standard in many new cars sold in the European Union and the United States by all the major automakers, in large part because its developers, Honeywell and Chemours, have automakers over a barrel. Their refrigerant is one of the few options that automakers have to comply with new regulations and the Kigali agreement. It has its detractors. The new refrigerant is at least 10 times as costly as the one it replaces. A number of rival manufacturers have filed suits to challenge the patent. Officials in India, which has a   car market, are deliberating over whether to grant patent protection. And then there is the safety issue. Daimler began raising red flags in 2012. A video the company made public was stark. It showed a   hatchback catching fire under the hood after 1234yf refrigerant leaked during a company simulation. Daimler eventually relented and went along with the rest of the industry, installing 1234yf in many of its new cars. But the company has developed an alternative using carbon dioxide that is being introduced in its   cars and some   models, with an eye toward further expansion. In a statement, Sandra GÃ¶dde, a spokeswoman for Daimler, said 1234yf had â€œdifferent flammability propertiesâ€ than the HFC coolant it was replacing, which is considered to be nonflammable. The company has developed â€œspecific measures in order to guarantee our high safety standards,â€ she added, including â€œa specially developed protective system. â€ Some engineers and environmentalists, however, say 1234yf is not a good option. â€œNone of the people in the car industry I know want to use it,â€ said Axel Friedrich, the former head of the transportation and noise division at the Umweltbundesamt, the German equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency. He added that he opposed having another â€œproduct in the front of the car which is flammable. â€ Dr. Friedrich, an engineer and a chemist, is also a member of the scientific advisory council of the International Council on Clean Transportation, the group that commissioned the tests that exposed Volkswagenâ€™s cheating on diesel emissions. He collaborated on tests of 1234yf with Deutsche Umwelthilfe, a German environmental group, which also raised fire concerns. While cars, obviously, contain other flammable materials, he was specifically worried that at high temperatures 1234yf emitted hydrogen fluoride, which is dangerous if inhaled or touched. â€œI wouldnâ€™t like to use it as a car owner, because it gives me a higher risk and higher cost,â€ Dr. Friedrich said. â€œItâ€™s a really unfair solution by the car industry. This is not what government and society should have accepted. â€ Honeywell and Chemours (which until last year was a unit of DuPont) have been adamant that the product is safe, and they are not alone. After the Daimler issue emerged, SAE International, an engineering consortium that includes all of the major automakers, said 1234yf was â€œhighly unlikely to ignite,â€ though the issue led to a brief split with German automakers. The Joint Research Center of the European Union has also said there was â€œno evidence of a serious risk. â€ It is being used across the auto industry and has gained approval from regulators in the United States and Europe. â€œDaimler was the only manufacturer that cited an issue,â€ said Ken Gayer, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Fluorine Products. â€œAll other car manufacturers at the time had incorporated 1234yf, which is mildly flammable, into their designs, with modest design changes, and proven to themselves conclusively that they could safely use the product,â€ he said. Daimlerâ€™s concerns led to a reassessment. â€œThe entire industry stepped back and said, â€˜Could we possibly have missed something? â€™â€ Mr. Gayer said. â€œWe reviewed all the work we did, and we also ran new tests to try to understand better what Daimlerâ€™s issue was. â€ At the end of that process, automakers and regulators â€œproved to themselves conclusively once again that 1234yf was safe for use in cars, and then finally in 2015 Daimler announced publicly that they would use the product,â€ Mr. Gayer said. Chemours said in a statement that the additional testing proved any â€œconcerns to be unfounded. â€ It added, â€œToday, all major global automakers around the world are using  . â€ One thing is not in dispute. The new coolant is superior to the HFC it is replacing in its impact on global warming. Hydrofluorocarbons have roughly 1, 400 times the impact of carbon dioxide, the baseline used to measure such chemicals. By contrast, studies of 1234yf have ranged from four times carbon dioxide to a recent assessment showing it has an even lower impact. Because of that, perhaps no single chemical is better positioned to take advantage of the Kigali agreement. While Honeywell and Chemours, when it was part of DuPont, lobbied to weaken and stall HFC regulations in the past, this time they were poised to profit from a product that had fresh patent protection, and they largely embraced the agreement. Though Honeywell would not give specific profit or revenue figures for 1234yf, sales of its HFC alternatives have helped the company raise annual revenue from its wider fluorine business by   percentages in the last few years to more than $1 billion. The companies, which sell products under different brand names, have â€œalmost a monopoly,â€ said Stephen O. Andersen, a former E. P. A. official who has been a representative to the Montreal Protocol and works for the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, an advocacy group. â€œThe price of the product is very high, about $80 a kilogram, and so that adds up to about $50 to $75 per car, which is a lot of money compared to the HFC they were using,â€ which he said was about $4 to $6 a car. â€œSo itâ€™s a big shock, and itâ€™s been a lot of controversy. â€ David Doniger, director of the Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, â€œThe safety concern is bogus. â€ â€œThe main concern is its high price,â€ Mr. Doniger said. â€œWhile a small part of the price of a car, this could be concerning when repairs are needed. â€ He said the price would decline after the patents expired, though that will take years. The conundrums and controversies highlight the complexities of refrigerants and the   inherent in the fight to curb global warming. In the 1980s, the Montreal Protocol led to the ban on chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, because of hazards to the ozone layer. They were replaced by HFCs, which are being curbed because of their effects on the climate. Will 1234yf be an equally transitory fix? â€œNothing lasts forever,â€ Dr. Singh, the Honeywell chemist, said. â€œAt least a couple generations. â€ Dorothee Saar, head of the transport and clean air team at Deutsche Umwelthilfe, the environmental group, said the new refrigerant presented considerable safety risks. She has her own solution. Ms. Saar, who lives in Berlin, has an old Volkswagen Golf without  . â€œI can always open a window,â€ she said."

Can Trump Save America Like Putin Saved Russia? 
The Saker 
October 22, 2016 
A crisis faces America: 
Option one: Hillary wins. Thatâ€™s Obama on steroids, only worse. Remember that Obama himself was Dubya, only worse. Of course, Dubya was just Clinton, only worse. Now the circle is closed. Back to Clinton. Except this time around, we have a woman who is deeply insecure, who failed at every single thing that she every tried to do, and who now has a 3 decades long record of disasters and failures. Even when she had no authority to start a war, she started one (told Bill to bomb the Serbs). Now she might have that authority. And she had to stand there, in front of millions of people, and hear Trump tell her â€œPutin outsmarted you at every step of the way.â€ Did you see her frozen face when he said that? Trump is right, Putin did outsmart her and Obama at every step. The problem is that now, after having a President with an inferiority complex towards Putin (Obama) we will have a President with the very same inferiority complex and a morbid determination to impose a no-fly zone over Russian forces in Syria. Looking at Hillary, with her ugly short hair and ridiculous pants, I thought to myself â€œthis is a woman who is trying hard to prove that she is every bit as tough and any manâ€ â€“ except of course that she ainâ€™t. Her record also shows her as being weak, cowardly and with a sense of total impunity. And now, that evil messianic lunatic (http://thesaker.is/the-messianic-lunatic-in-her-own-words/) with a deep-seated inferiority complex might become Commander in Chief?! God help us all! 
Option two: Trump wins. Problem: he will be completely alone. The Neocons have a total, repeat total, control of the Congress, the media, banking and finance, and the courts. From Clinton to Clinton they have deeply infiltrated the Pentagon, Foggy Bottom, and the three letter agencies. The Fed is their stronghold. How in the world will Trump deal with these rabid â€œ crazies in the basementâ€? http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_donald_a_080423_leo_strauss_and_the_.htm 
Consider the vicious hate campaign which all these â€œpersonalitiesâ€ (from actors, to politicians to reporters) have unleashed against Trump â€“ they have burned their bridges, they know that they will lose it all if Trump wins (and, if he proves to be an easy pushover his election will make no difference anyway). The Neocons have nothing to lose and they will fight to the very last one. What could Trump possibly do to get anything done if he is surrounded by Neocons and their agents of influence? Bring in an entirely different team? How is he going to vet them? His first choice was to take Pence as a VP â€“ a disaster (he is already sabotaging Trump on Syria and the elections outcome). I *dread* to hear whom Trump will appoint as a White House Chief of Staff as I am afraid that just to appease the Neocons he will appoint some new version of the infamous Rahm Emanuelâ€¦ And should Trump prove that he has both principles and courage, the Neocons can always â€œDallasâ€ him and replace him with Pence. Et voilÃ ! 
I see only one way out: 
How Putin Rescued Russia When Putin came to power he inherited a Kremlin every bit as corrupt and traitor-infested as the White House nowadays. As for Russia, she was in pretty much the same sorry shape as the Independent Nazi-run Ukraine. Russia was also run by bankers and AngloZionist puppets and most Russians led miserable lives. The big difference is that, unlike what is happening with Trump, the Russian version of the US Neocons never saw the danger coming from Putin. He was selected by the ruling elites as the representative of the security services to serve along a representative of the big corporate money, Medvedev. This was a compromise solution between the only two parts of the Russian society which were still functioning, the security services and oil/gas money. Putin looked like a petty bureaucrat in an ill fitting suit, a shy and somewhat awkward little guy who would present no threat to the powerful oligarchs of the the Seven Bankers running Russia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semibankirschina ). Except that he turned out to be one of the most formidable rulers in Russia history. Here is what Putin did as soon as he came to power: 
First, he re-established the credibility of the Kremlin with the armed forces and security services by rapidly and effectively crushing the Wahabi insurgency in Chechnia. This established his personal credibility with the people he would have to rely on to deal with the oligarchs. 
Second, he used the fact that everybody, every single businessman and corporation in Russia, did more or less break the law during the 1990s, if only because there really was no law. Instead of cracking down on the likes of Berezovski or Khodorkovski for their political activities, he crushed them with (absolutely true) charges of corruption. Crucially, he did that very publicly, sending a clear message to the other arch-enemy: the media. 
Third, contrary to the hallucinations of the western human rights agencies and Russian liberals, Putin never directly suppressed any dissent, or cracked down on the media or, even less so, ordered the murder of anybody. He did something much smarter. Remember that modern journalists are first and foremost presstitutes, right? By mercilessly cracking down on the oligarchs Putin deprived the presstitutes of their source of income and political support. Some emigrated to the Ukraine, others simply resigned, and a few were left like on a reservation or a zoo on a few very clearly identifiable media outlets such as Dozhd TV, Ekho Moskvy Radio or the newspaper Kommersant. Those who emigrated became irrelevant, as for those who stayed in the â€œliberal zooâ€ â€“ they were harmless as they had no credibility left. Crucially, everybody else â€œgot the messageâ€. After that, all it took is the appointment a few real patriots (such as Dmitri Kiselev, Margarita Simonian and others) in key positions and everybody quickly understood that the winds of fortune had now turned. 
Fourth, once the main media outlets were returned back to sanity it did not take too long for the â€œliberalâ€ (in the Russian sense, meaning pro-USA) parties to enter into a death-spiral from which they have never recovered. That, in turn, resulted in the ejection of all â€œliberalsâ€ from the Duma which now has only 4 parties, all of them more or less â€œpatrioticâ€. Thatâ€™s the part of Putinâ€™s strategy that worked. 
So far, Putin has failed to eject the 5th columnists, whom I call the â€œAtlantic Integrationistsâ€ (see http://thesaker.is/putins-biggest-failure/ ) from the government itself. What is certain is that Putin has not tackled the 5th columnists in the banking/finance sector and that the latter are being very careful not to give him a pretext to take action against them. 
Russia and the USA are very different countries, and no recipe can be simply copied from one to another. Still, there are valuable lessons from the â€œPutin modelâ€ for Trump, not the least of which that his most formidable enemies probably are sitting in the Fed and in the banks that control the Fed. What is sure is that for the time being the image of the USA will continue to be that of homeless veterans abandoned by the US government wrapping themselves in the American flag and asking for coins in a cup. 
Hillary thinks that Ameriaâ€™s wars are a stunning success. Trump thinks that they are a disgrace. I submit that the choice between these two is really very simple. 
To those who are saying that there cannot be a schism in the AngloZionist elites, I reply that the example of the conspiracy to prevent Dominique Strauss-Kahn from becoming the next French president ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_v._Strauss-Kahn ) shows that, just like hyenas, AngloZionist leaders do sometimes turn on each other. That happens in all regimes, regardless of their political ideology (think SS against SA in Nazi Germany or Trotskists against Stalinists in Boshevik USSR). 
An Iron Broom Leon Trotsky used to say the Soviet Russia needed to be cleansed from anarchists and noblemen with an â€œiron broomâ€. He even wrote an article in the Pravda entitled â€œWe need an iron broomâ€. Another genocidal manic, Felix Derzhinskii, founder of the notorious ChK secret police, used to say that a secret police officer must have a â€œburning heart, a cool head and clean handsâ€. One would seek weakness, or even compassion, in vain from folks like these. These are ideology-driven â€œtrue believersâ€, sociopaths with no sense of empathy, profoundly evil people with a genocidal hatred of anybody standing in their way. 
Hillary Clinton and her gang of Neocons are the spiritual (and sometimes even physical) successors of the Soviet Bolsheviks and they, just like their Bolshevik forefathers, will not hesitate for a second to crush their enemies. Donald Trump â€“ assuming he is for real and actually means what he says â€“ has to understand that and do what Putin did: strike first and strike hard. 
Stalin, by the way, also did exactly that, and the Trotskyists were crushed. 
I think that the jury is still out on whether Putin will succeed in finally removing the 5th columnists from power. What is sure is that Russia is at least semi-free from the control of the Anglo-Zionists and that the US is their last bastion right now. Their maniacal hatred of Trump can in part be explained by the sense of danger these folks feel, being threatened for the first time in what they see as their homeland (I donâ€™t mean that in a patriotic sense â€“ but rather like a parasiteâ€™s care for â€œhisâ€ host). And maybe they have some good reason to fear. I sure hope that they do. 
I am rather encouraged by the way Trump handled the latest attempt to make him cower in fear. Yesterday Trump dared to declare that since the election might be rigged or stolen he does not pledge to recognize the outcome. And even though every semi-literate person knows that elections in the USA have been rigged and stolen in the past, including Presidential ones, by saying that Trump committed a major case of crimethink. The Ziomedia pounced on him with self-righteous outrage and put immense pressure on him to retract his statement. Instead of rolling over and recanting his â€œcrimeâ€, Trump replied that he will respect the election results if he wins. 
Beautiful no? Letâ€™s hope he continues to show the same courage. 
Trump is doing now what Jean-Marie Le Pen did in France: he is showing the Neocons that be that he dares to openly defy them, that he refuses to play by their rules, that their outrage has no effect on him and that they donâ€™t get to censor or, even less so, silence him. That is also what he did when, yet again, he refused to accuse the Russians of cyber-attacks and, instead, repeated that it would be a good thing for Russia and the USA to be friends. Again, I am not sure that how long he will be able to hold that line, but for the time being there is no denying that he is openly defying the AngloZionist deep state and Empire. 
Conclusion: The United States are about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of their history. If Trump is elected, he will have to immediately launch a well-planned attack against his opponents without giving them any pretext to accuse him of politically motivated repressions. In Russia, Putin could count on the support of the military and the security services. I donâ€™t know whom Trump can count on, but I am fairly confident that there are still true patriots in the US armed forces. If Trump gets the right person to head the FBI, he might also use that agency to clean house and deliver a steady streams of indictments for corruption, conspiracy to (fill the blank), abuse of authority, obstruction of justice and dereliction of duty, etc. Since such crimes are widespread in the current circles of power, they are also easy to prove, and cracking down on corruption would get Trump a standing ovation from the American people. Next, just as Putin did in Russia, Trump will have to deal with the media. How exactly, I donâ€™t know. But he will have to face this beast and defeat it. At every step in this process he will have to get the proactive support of the people, just like Putin does. 
Can Trump do it? I donâ€™t know. I would argue that to overthrow the deep state and restore the power of the people is even harder in the USA than it was in Russia. I have always believed that the AngloZionist Empire will have to be brought down from the outside, most probably by a combination of military and economic defeats. I still believe that. However, I might be wrong â€“ in fact, I hope that I am â€“ and maybe Trump will be the guy to bring down the Empire in order to save the United States. If there is such a possibility, however slim, I think that we have to believe in it and act on it as all the alternatives are far worse.

21384,Highlights From Judge Gorsuchâ€™s Confirmation Hearing - The New York Times,"Adam Liptak, Charlie Savage, Matt Flegenheimer and Carl Hulse","Here are highlights from Judge Neil M. Gorsuchâ€™s third day at his Senate confirmation hearings: â–  Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, asked Judge Gorsuch why, when he was a Bush administration Justice Department official in 2005, he had scribbled â€œyesâ€ on a document beside a question about whether C. I. A. torture of terrorism suspects had yielded valuable intelligence. He said was merely acting as a lawyer. â–  Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat, pushed Judge Gorsuch to say whether a president has constitutional powers to lawfully override torture and wiretap statutes. Judge Gorsuch said he would approach such a case using analysis set out when President Harry S. Truman tried to seize steel mills. â–  Mr. Leahy also pressed Judge Gorsuch to say whether he would recuse himself from Supreme Court cases involving the Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz, who was a former client and helped get him appointed to the appeals court. Judge Gorsuch did not answer directly. â–  The nominee would not discuss whether President Trumpâ€™s business dealings with foreign governments might run afoul of the Emoluments Clause, an obscure constitutional provision that the judge said â€œhas sat in a rather dusty cornerâ€ until recently. â–  Judge Gorsuch defended his originalist judicial philosophy, assuring skeptics that â€œno one is looking to return us to the    days. â€ â–  When asked about his views on cameras recording Supreme Court proceedings, Judge Gorsuch would say only that he would keep an open mind. â–  The energy level in the hearing room in the Hart Senate Office Building was noticeably diminished from the previous two days. There was a clear sense that the proceedings were winding down. â–  Byron Whiteâ€™s Supreme Court hearing took only 90 minutes. Judge Gorsuchâ€™s is in its third day. Here are some highlights so far: Senator Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, pressed Judge Gorsuch about a   document from his time as a senior Justice Department official in  . It was a set of questions about the C. I. A. program, including: â€œHave the aggressive interrogation techniques employed by the administration yielded any valuable intelligence? Have they ever stopped a terrorist incident? Examples?â€ In the margin next to this, Judge Gorsuch had scribbled, â€œYes. â€ Ms. Feinstein, who was the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when it conducted an investigation into the   torture program that concluded otherwise  â€”   asked Judge Gorsuch what information he had received that led him to write â€œyes. â€ He replied: â€œMy recollection of 12 years ago is that that was the position that the clients were telling us. I was a lawyer. My job was as an advocate, and we were dealing with detainee litigation. That was my job. â€ Senator Leahy, of Vermont, also returned to the question of whether Judge Gorsuch believed in the Bush administrationâ€™s theory that the president, as    could override torture and surveillance laws. Asked about that on Tuesday, Judge Gorsuch had repeatedly said the president was not â€œabove the law. â€ Mr. Leahy pointed out that Mr. Bushâ€™s legal team did not argue that he was â€œabove the law,â€ but rather that â€œthe lawâ€ meant the Constitution gave presidents inherent authority to lawfully bypass such statutes. The senator pressed Judge Gorsuch to be more specific. He replied that â€œpresidents make all sorts of arguments about inherent authority  â€”   they do  â€”   and that is why we have courts, to decide. â€ Mr. Leahy followed up, asking whether Judge Gorsuch could think of a case in which a court decided that a president could override a statute. Judge Gorsuch said he could not think of one, and Mr. Leahy agreed. This was almost certainly the first confirmation hearing to feature questions on the Constitutionâ€™s Emoluments Clause, which may bar President Trumpâ€™s businesses from doing business with companies controlled by foreign governments. The clause says that â€œno person holding any office of profit or trustâ€ shall â€œaccept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign stateâ€ unless Congress consents. The word emolument means compensation for labor or services. Asked about the clause by Senator Leahy, Judge Gorsuch said â€œthe Emoluments Clause has sat in a rather dusty cornerâ€ and â€œis not a clause that has attracted a lot of attention until recently. â€ But Judge Gorsuch would say no more given what he said was at least potential litigation on the subject. Lawsuits have been filed against President Trump, claiming he has violated the clause. â€œI have to be very careful about expressing any views,â€ Judge Gorsuch said. Senator Leahy also asked Judge Gorsuch to say whether he would continue on the Supreme Court to recuse himself from cases involving the Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz, with whom he has various ties. Among those ties: Mr. Anschutz was Judge Gorsuchâ€™s former client and in 2006, he successfully lobbied the Bush White House to appoint Mr. Gorsuch to the appeals court. Mr. Leahy noted that Judge Gorsuch had left the door open to changing his appeals court practice and participating in cases involving Mr. Anschutzâ€™s interests on the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch did not answer directly, saying he would study the law and the practices of his colleagues and the facts before making a decision. But Mr. Leahy pointed out that the law was the same for both appeals court judges and Supreme Court justices, except that justicesâ€™ decisions not to recuse themselves cannot be appealed to anyone. There is scant precedent about how justices have interpreted whether cases involving former clients raise an actual or apparent conflict of interest because few modern justices had extensive backgrounds in private practice. But Justice Clarence Thomas, who worked as   counsel for Monsanto from 1977 to 1979, has participated in cases involving that company. Judge Gorsuch echoed earlier Republican Supreme Court nominees when he said American courts should not look to foreign and international law in interpreting the Constitution. â€œAs a general matter Iâ€™d say itâ€™s improper to look abroad when interpreting our Constitution,â€ Judge Gorsuch said. In his 2005 confirmation hearing, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said something similar. â€œForeign law, you can find anything you want,â€ Chief Justice Roberts said. â€œLooking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends. â€ But the Supreme Court has consulted foreign sources in cases on gay rights and the death penalty, and its more liberal justices say it is proper to take account of wisdom from abroad. â€œForeign opinions are not authoritative they set no binding precedent for the U. S. judge,â€ Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a 2006 address to the Constitutional Court of South Africa. â€œBut they can add to the story of knowledge relevant to the solution of trying questions. â€ Judge Gorsuch said foreign courts do consider American law. â€œEverybody else looks to us,â€ he said. Democrats have struggled to find an attack line that sticks against Judge Gorsuch. But they appeared to sense a potential opening outside the hearing room: a Supreme Court decision on Wednesday that lawmakers sought to frame as a rebuke of the nominee. Not long after he started his testimony on Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch defended an opinion he had written that ruled against an autistic student whose parents had sought reimbursement for his education under a federal law, the Individuals with Disability Education Act. Judge Gorsuch said he had merely applied a standard set out in a Supreme Court decision as interpreted by an earlier decision of his court, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver. At about the same time Wednesday, the Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision saying the 10th Circuit had been wrong. All that was required from public school systems, the 10th Circuit had said, was a â€œmore than de minimisâ€ benefit. Writing for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. disagreed. â€œWhen all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing â€˜merely more than de minimisâ€™ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all. â€ Asked about the Supreme Court decision later on Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch said he had been bound by precedents from the Supreme Court and from the 10th Circuit in the opinion he had written. Still, Democrats quickly pounced. â€œPresident Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, was unanimously rebuked today by the Supreme Court,â€ said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and the Democratsâ€™ leader. He also said the case reinforced â€œa continued, troubling pattern of Judge Gorsuch deciding against everyday Americans  â€”   even children who require special assistance at school. Fortunately, in this case, every single justice on the court agreed that Judge Gorsuch was wrong. â€ Republican aides, for perhaps the first time all week, appeared on the defensive, sending out talking points that Judge Gorsuch was not on the panel in the case and did not invent the relevant legal test. He was merely adhering to binding precedent, they said. It has been the custom of Supreme Court nominees to endorse video coverage of arguments in the court during their confirmation hearings  â€”   only to retreat later on. Judge Gorsuch would not even go that far. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Judge Gorsuch on Wednesday morning to keep an open mind on the topic. The judge agreed to do that much. On Tuesday, Judge Gorsuch said cameras in the courtroom were â€œnot a question that I confess Iâ€™ve given a great deal of thought to,â€ adding that, â€œIâ€™ve experienced more cameras in the last few weeks than I have in my whole lifetime by a long, long way. â€ The last two successful Supreme Court nominees, Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, endorsed camera coverage at their hearings. â€œI have had positive experiences with cameras,â€ Justice Sotomayor said in 2009. In 2010, Justice Kagan said video coverage â€œwould be a great thing for the institution, and more important, I think it would be a great thing for the American people. â€ After joining the court, the two justices started expressing doubts about the value of letting citizens see their government at work."

These days it has most certainly become chic for the modern liberal to throw about accusations of racism. Although this type of race-baiting has been going on for a number of years now, it became more noticeable during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. When these liberals accuse Donald Trump of being racist, they had better be careful for one specific reason: 
A leaked video from 2008 shows that during President Obama â€™s first campaign, he was also concerned about border security, and he even suggested a wall! Now, there is just one dominant question anti- Trump individuals need to digest: 
Is Obama a racist too? Because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse Trump of. Letâ€™s play a quick game. If you didnâ€™t know who said this, would you think it was Donald Trump in 2016 or Barack Obama in 2008? 
This manâ€™s core goal was to â€œpreserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration.â€ Does this sound like Trump or Obama ? 
How about this one? This man said, â€œadditional fencing could help get our border under control.â€ Definitely sounds more like a GOP candidate than a Democrat one, thatâ€™s for sure. 
Finally, this man also supported â€œadditional personnel, infrastructure, and technology on our border and at ports of entry.â€ Liberals would love to claim these quotes came from Donald J. Trump , especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment. 
I hate to steal their thunder, but these quotes did indeed come from a young Barack Obama in 2008. Even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him. 
So, it is one thing when leaked videos show Hillary Clinton believed border security was important. It was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important, but when liberal idol Barack Obama says it? Say it isnâ€™t so! Liberals just canâ€™t handle that. 
But anyway, folks, it is all about platforms. Iâ€™m sure you have learned by now that Donald Trump doesnâ€™t get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy. First of all, he is a conservative, so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate. 
Republicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control. Luckily, people saw through the propaganda and decided that Obama â€™s brand was simply not working any longer. 
People are fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another. If you are looking for a reason why Donald Trump is the new president and not Hillary Clinton, there you go. "
21388,Another Baltimore Police Officer Acquitted in Freddie Gray Case - The New York Times,Jess Bidgood,"BALTIMORE  â€”   It was the third straight acquittal, by the same judge, on the same set of facts: On Monday, Lt. Brian Rice, the   Baltimore police officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray, was found not guilty of three charges, including involuntary manslaughter. And a question that has been simmering among some legal observers ever since acquittals began piling up in the   prosecution immediately turned to a full boil: With no convictions to show in four trials related to the death of Mr. Gray, a    black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury during an arrest in which he rode unsecured in a police van, should prosecutors drop a retrial and the two others that remain? â€œIt would seem at this point the state has exhausted all of its possible theories, and should give real consideration to ending these prosecutions,â€ said Warren Alperstein, a defense lawyer in Baltimore who has been closely following the trials. â€œThere are many that would argue itâ€™s time to cut the losses. â€ Another local defense lawyer, Warren A. Brown, put it differently as he reflected on the fact that Judge Barry G. Williams had again determined that prosecutors did not present enough evidence to prove that the officer on trial had committed a crime. â€œThe facts are the same in all the cases,â€ Mr. Brown said. â€œIf you keep going to the store with 89 cents, and they keep telling you you need a dollar, why are you going to keep going back?â€ Defense lawyers are, by definition, apt to scrutinize prosecutors, and there has been no indication that prosecutors plan to drop the cases. Other observers have praised the trials for raising important issues. But the questions underscore the challenges as they press ahead. Two of the three previous trials, of Officers Edward M. Nero and Caesar R. Goodson Jr. ended in acquittals. The trial of Officer William G. Porter was declared a mistrial. The death of Mr. Gray in April 2015 shook this city to its core, spurring violent protests, and became a grim fixture of the reckoning over how police officers use force against minorities, particularly black men. In May of last year, the cityâ€™s top prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, announced charges against six police officers in Mr. Grayâ€™s death, prompting cheers from activists and quelling the nightly unrest that had gripped parts of the city. It was not expected to be easy it is rare to charge police officers with crimes, and rarer still for them to be convicted. Since then, cases of shootings by the police in Baton Rouge, La. and Falcon Heights, Minn. have outraged activists anew, and the country has been shaken by the deaths of eight police officers in two attacks, in Dallas and Baton Rouge. And in Baltimore, prosecutors have scrutinized the same narrative in trial after trial, bringing little resolution to lingering questions about the death of Mr. Gray and failing to secure a single conviction against any of the officers. The outcomes have fueled criticism that Ms. Mosbyâ€™s charges were too ambitious or politically motivated, and have eroded the confidence, even among supporters of the trials, that a conviction can ever be secured. â€œShe put her job on the line  â€”   she put her life on the line to do the right thing, but where it happened and where it got lost, I donâ€™t know,â€ said Tawanda Jones, who stood with a small group of demonstrators outside the downtown courthouse after the verdict was announced Monday. â€œIâ€™m convinced that we will absolutely get no convictions. â€ Ms. Jones then headed to a news conference to mark the three years that have passed since the death of her brother, Tyrone West, after a struggle with the police. Judge Williams, a former federal prosecutor who built winning cases against officers himself, read his verdict from the bench and began with a warning: â€œAt this time, and all times, it is critical for this court not to base any decision on public opinion or emotion,â€ he said before methodically dismantling the case against Lieutenant Rice, who was the officer who first called in the foot chase of Mr. Gray in downtrodden West Baltimore. And, prosecutors said, he climbed into the van with Mr. Gray but failed to secure him with a seatbelt, which they said had set in motion a chain of events that led to Mr. Grayâ€™s death. But Judge Williams said they had not proved that Lieutenant Rice was grossly negligent in failing to use a seatbelt on Mr. Gray or, indeed, that his failure to do so had led to Mr. Grayâ€™s death. â€œThis court does not find that the state has proven that the defendant was aware that the failure to seatbelt created a risk of death or serious physical injury to Mr. Gray under the facts presented,â€ he said. As the judge concluded his ruling, supporters of Lieutenant Rice pressed in to congratulate him. They included Officers Nero and Goodson and another officer, Garrett E. Miller, who is set to be tried this month. Ms. Mosby was not in the courtroom. In addition to Officer Miller, Sgt. Alicia D. White and Officer Porter, who faces a retrial, are still set to have their day in court. Officers Miller and Porter will have to be tried by a new team of prosecutors, because they have already been questioned on the stand by the main prosecutors on the case. â€œAn office that believes a crime occurred can see benefits in making a statement that criminal activity will not be tolerated by their office and that they value the lives of every member of the community, and that can justify pursuing cases,â€ said David Jaros, an assistant professor of law at the University of Baltimore. But, Professor Jaros added, â€œthereâ€™s no question that after today, the hurdles seem as high as theyâ€™ve ever been. â€"

CETA: â€œEUâ€™s Canada free-trade CETA deal could be back on as Walloons agree to last-minute dealâ€ [ Telegraph ]. â€œBelgiumâ€™s Prime Minister Charles Michel said that Wallonia was now in agreement, and the regional parliaments may now agree to CETA by the end of Friday night, opening the door to the deal being signed. Mr Tusk said that once the regional votes had taken place, he will inform Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Any extra concessions given to Wallonia may mean other countries will want to look again at the deal, however.â€ (The BBCâ€™s headline, then â€” â€œEU-Canada trade deal: Belgians break Ceta deadlockâ€ â€” is quite irresponsible. As isâ€“ 
CETA: â€œBelgium breaks Ceta deadlockâ€ [ EUObserver ]. Not quite: 
Belgiumâ€™s political entities agreed to a declaration on Thursday (26 October), which gives their government a green light to sign Ceta, the EU-Canada trade pact. 
The agreement was promptly sent to EU ambassadors in Brussels, to be discussed later in the afternoon. 
After a week of marathon negotiations, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said that Thursdayâ€™s talks had calmed â€œoutstanding concernsâ€. 
As part of the trade-off, Belgium will ask the European Court of Justice to clarify the proposed investment court system, which was one of the most controversial elements of the trade deal. 
Ceta was due to be signed off by EU leaders and Canadaâ€™s prime minister Justin Trudeau at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Trudeau cancelled the trip during the night as no agreement had been reached in Brussels. 
Itâ€™s not known when the summit will take place, or whether the Belgian go-ahead was the last hurdle. 
The other 27 EU countries must first accept the Belgian deal. 
At their meeting on Thursday, EU ambassadors will be accompanied by lawyers and representatives of the EU institutions, who will examine the legality and consequences of the text. 
The Walloon parliament will vote on the agreement on Friday. 
Still, how do we slay these undead deals? The same thing happened with TPP. 
CETA: â€œThe great CETA swindleâ€ [ Corporate Europe Observatory ]. â€œThe latest PR move is a â€œjoint interpretative declarationâ€ on the trade deal hammered out by Ottawa and Brussels and published by investigative journalist collective Correctiv last Friday. It is designed to alleviate public concerns but in fact does nothing to fix CETAâ€™s flaws. In September, Canadaâ€™s Trade Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and her German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, had announced such a text to appease Social Democrats, trade unions and the wider public who fear that CETA would threaten public services, labour and environmental standards and undermine governmentsâ€™ right to regulate in the public interest. Several governments, notably Austria, had linked their â€˜yesâ€™ to CETA to the declaration. [But] According to environmental group Greenpeace, the declaration therefore has the â€˜legal weight of a holiday brochureâ€™.â€ 
Legal experts have also warned that the declaration â€œcould be misleading for non-lawyers, who might think that the Declaration will alter or override the CETAâ€. But it does not change CETAâ€™s legal terms â€“ and it is these terms which have raised concerns. As Canadian law Professor Gus van Harten explains: â€œBased on principles of treaty interpretation, the CETA will be interpreted primarily according to the text of its relevant provisionsâ€¦. The Declaration would play a subsidiary role, if any, in this interpretative process.â€ In other words, legally (and thus politically), the CETA text is far more important than the declaration â€“ and the former could prevail over the latter in case of a conflictive interpretation. 
The post then goes on to analyze the provisions of the declaration in detail, comparing them to the text. (Readers may remember that TPP advocates have made the same sort of claim for the TPP Preamble, which the text also over-rides . So, the Belgians are smart to get a court ruling on this. And we might also expect the adminsitration to use similar tactics to (the toothless distraction of) the CETA â€œresolutionâ€ in the upcoming attempt to pass the TPP. 
â€œBelgian officials were discussing a working document aimed at addressing Walloniaâ€™s concerns on the trade deal. The document, published by Belgian state media RTBF, shows that Belgium is moving toward requesting additional safeguards for the agricultural sector â€˜in cases of market turbulence.â€™ It also puts forward a number of requests regarding the investor court system, including â€˜progressing towards hiring judges on a permanent basis'â€ [ Politico ]. This seems to be a different document from the â€œdeclarationâ€; it was leaked by a different source. Here is is; itâ€™s in French . 
TPP: â€œEight major financial services industry associations made an appeal to congressional leaders to support passage of the TPP this year, arguing that the deal is â€˜vital to ensuring that the U.S. financial services sector remains a vibrant engine for domestic and global growth'â€ [ Politico ]. What the heck is a â€œvibrant engineâ€? Maybe a screw loose or something? Needs a tightening to stop the shaking and shimmying? 
TPP: â€œHealth, labor and consumer groups are warning President Barack Obama to refrain from including a 12-year monopoly period for biological drugs in legislation to implement the TPP as a means for addressing congressional concerns over the pact. The groups argue that such a move could undermine future efforts to shorten that protection period under U.S. lawâ€ [ Politico ]. â€œThe letter, signed by Doctors Without Borders, the AFL-CIO, AARP, Oxfam and Consumers Union, also expresses concern over reports that the administration is prepared to negotiate side letters with TPP countries to reinforce U.S. lawmaker demands that countries respect a 12-year protection period, which reflects U.S. law.â€

â€œAs a longtime Bill Clinton adviser came under fire several years ago for alleged conflicts of interest involving a private consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation, he mounted an audacious defense: Bill Clintonâ€™s doing it, tooâ€ [ Politico ]. 
â€œThe unusual and brash rejoinder from veteran Clinton aide and Teneo Consulting co-founder Doug Band is scattered across the thousands of hacked emails published by WikiLeaks, but a memo released Wednesday provides the most detailed look to date at the intertwined worlds of nonprofit, for-profit, official and political activities involving Clinton and many of his top aides. 
The memo at one point refers bluntly to the money-making part of Clintonâ€™s life as â€˜Bill Clinton Inc.â€™ and notes that in at least one case a company â€” global education firm Laureate International Universities â€” began paying Clinton personally after first being a donor to the Clinton Foundation.

â€œGoldman Sachs: Election Wonâ€™t End Like Brexitâ€ [Barrons, via Across the Curve ]. â€œWe think that the upcoming U.S. election wonâ€™t end up as another Brexit-styled surprise for for two reasons.â€ 
First, and most importantly, whole both situations represented an opportunity for voters to endorse a change in the status quo, voters in the UK were asked to decide on an idea whereas in the US they are being asked to decide on a person. The distinction is illustrated in US polling by the difference between the small share of Americans who believe the country is moving in the right direction (29%) and majority who approve of the job President Obama is doing (52%). 
Second. While the polls conducted on the eve of the referendum vote showed â€œremainâ€ with a 4.6pp lead, in contrast to the 3.8pp actual vote margin in favor of â€œleaveâ€, an average of polls published by the Economist magazine the day before the election showed a tied race, and showed â€œleaveâ€ leading for much of the prior month. As much as 10% of the public in many of these surveys was also undecided. By contrast, Sec. Clinton has led the average of presidential polls consistently for more than a year, with the exception of one week in late July following the Republican convention, and for most of the last year her lead has been substantial, averaging 4pp since the last primary elections were held.

21391,Note to America: DonÂ’t Be So Sure YouÂ’ve Put Trump Behind You   : Information,Gary Younge," Note to America: DonÂ’t Be So Sure YouÂ’ve Put Trump Behind You
Take it from a Brit, right-wing populism will thrive until you deal with it genuinely.
By Gary Younge October 31, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" The Nation "" - A I Â’ve been living in Britain for the last year and have returned to the United States to cover the election from a small town in IndianaÂ—with the experience of Brexit on my mind.
On June 24, a significant proportion of the British electorate woke up and thought they were living in a different country. Britain narrowly voted to leave the European Union. It felt like the politics of fear, isolation, and xenophobia had delivered an utterly devastating and enduring blow to the body politic. There are many lessons from that night, and indeed we in Britain are only just beginning to learn them. But as it relates to the American elections, I want to dwell on just three.
The fact that the messenger is deranged doesnÂ’t mean the message itself contains no significant truths.
First, donÂ’t let the polls guide your strategic decisions about voting. If you want Hillary Clinton to win, vote for her. If you favor Jill Stein, vote for her. DonÂ’t cast your vote thinking youÂ’re compensating for a result that has not been declared but that you think youÂ’ve factored in. You donÂ’t know.
The Brexit result caught the currency traders, pollsters, betting agencies, and commentators off guard. One of the leading voices of the Leave campaign, Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party, conceded defeat at 10 pm the night of the election; less than six hours later he claimed victory.
As I write, polls suggest a runaway victory for Clinton. They could be right. But politics is in a very volatile stateÂ—they could also be wrong. And the only way youÂ’ll know for sure will be when itÂ’s too late to do anything about it.
Second, the fact that the messenger is deranged doesnÂ’t mean the message itself contains no significant truths. Before the Brexit referendum, liberals broadly dismissed Leave voters as ignorant, angry, and bigoted. Some of them were undoubtedly all three. But thatÂ’s not primarily what was driving many of them. It took the Brexit result for the nation to pay attention to communities devastated by neoliberal globalization. Had Remain won, those who were forgotten would have remained forgotten.
True, politicians have drawn mostly the wrong conclusions: condemning the free movement of people rather than the free movement of capital. Nonetheless, regions long ignored, accents rarely heard, and issues seldom raised are traveling from the margins to the mainstream of British politics.
Similarly, if Hillary Clinton wins, that should not blind us to some of the themes that have made TrumpÂ’s candidacy viable. In Muncie, Indiana, where I have spent most of this election season, huge manufacturing plants have closed since the passage of NAFTA, leaving one-third of the town in poverty. And while TrumpÂ’s base is not particularly poor, a significant portion of the nation is desperate. ItÂ’s not difficult to see why. The price of everything apart from labor has shot up in the past 40 years, while inequality has grown and social mobility has slumped. TrumpÂ’s original Brexit strategy of targeting Rust Belt towns in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin may not have worked electorally, but what he identified remains a politically salient fault line that doesnÂ’t just go away if Clinton wins. If these problems are not tended to, a less erratic and more focused right-wing populist than Trump could easily exploit them.
Which brings us to the third lesson. Trump is deluded about many things, but heÂ’s right to insist that the media and political classes are out of touch with the population. They exist in a fetid ideological comfort zone where radical change is considered apostasy at precisely the moment when radical change is both necessary and popular.
Leading up to the Brexit vote, leaders of the Remain campaign preferred to caricature those in the opposing camp rather than engage them. They deÂ­rided not only the leaders of the Leave campaign but its followers. You cannot convince people they are doing well when they are not. Yet throughout the Brexit campaign, Remain advocates lectured voters on all the advantages they derived from the European Union and how much worse things would be if they left. From Tony Blair to David Cameron, people who had stiffed working people in a range of ways now insisted they alone could save them from themselves. People just werenÂ’t buying it.
Similarly, people in Muncie and elsewhere are aware that some of the worst things to come out of WashingtonÂ—Â­including NAFTA, financial deregulation, and the Iraq WarÂ—were bipartisan efforts in which the mainstream media acted as cheerleaders. That is why, I assume, Delaware County, where Muncie resides, voted for both Trump and Bernie Sanders in the primaries. When Democrats wheel out high-ranking Republicans who now disown Trump, they donÂ’t realize they are making TrumpÂ’s point for him: The establishment that has done nothing for you hates meÂ—I must be doing something right .
Brexit and the US elections are not synonymous. But there is plenty of overlap in the nationalist nostalgia, xenophobia, political dislocation, and class grievance that they draw upon.
Time and again in Muncie, Trump supporters, some of whom voted for Obama, say they really just want to Â“shake things up.Â” They are not alone. Â“The Democratic establishment is very, very happy with incremental change,Â” says Dave Ring, who backed Bernie and runs an organic farm and food store in Muncie called the Downtown Farm Stand. Â“And the rest of the public is out here like, Â‘We donÂ’t have time for incremental change. We donÂ’t have time for that. Why would we want to wait?Â’Â”
This sense of urgency will not go away if Hillary wins, any more than a Remain vote would have signaled that all was well with British society. We didnÂ’t wake up in a different country on June 24; it was simply a country we had ceased to recognize. A defeat for Trump, regardless of its magnitude, should not be misunderstood as an endorsement of the status quo. Just because you havenÂ’t descended into the abyss, as Britain did, doesnÂ’t mean youÂ’re not standing dangerously close to its edge.
Å  2015 The Nation FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe: The surprise disclosure that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are taking a new look at Hillary ClintonÂ’s email use lays bare, just days before the election, tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee.

21392,Calling on Angels While Enduring the Trials of Job - The New York Times,Andy Newman,"Angels are everywhere in the MuÃ±iz familyâ€™s apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall, ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR, angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves.

Then Zoraidaâ€™s grandfather  â€”   the father of her absent father  â€”   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met JosÃ©, a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle, a judge, they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction, using skills she learned as a child, and in a clothing store. But in 1987, Mr. MuÃ±iz began having violent seizures  â€”   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life, they started a family. Their first child, JosÃ© Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. Thatâ€™s where the angels came in  â€”   the first one was a painting, a gift from a cousin.  â€œWhen they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die,â€ Ms. MuÃ±iz, 50, said. â€œFrom there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. â€ All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the MuÃ±izesâ€™ overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. MuÃ±iz. â€œSo many people throw away things, so I donâ€™t have to buy,â€ she said. A second son, Jesus, became epileptic at 3. A girl, Maria, completed the family. In 2007, Mr. MuÃ±iz had what felt like a horrible, stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. MuÃ±iz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. â€œIâ€™m willing to take anything with him,â€ she said. â€œI never left him alone, and I never will. â€ Radiation did not work. To save Mr. MuÃ±izâ€™s life, surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured, depressed and unable to speak, he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the MuÃ±iz children grew up. â€œWeâ€™ve been through every craziness,â€ said JosÃ© Jr. 24, who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment, â€œevery up and down. â€ For years at a time, the family held on, seemingly by a thread. Over the summer, the younger son, Jesus, 22, got a   job at a Zaroâ€™s Bakery in Manhattanâ€™s financial district. Because the familyâ€™s rent is tied to income, the rent tripled in August, to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for JosÃ© Sr. â€™s mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. MuÃ±iz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Timesâ€™s Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent, got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund, the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college, where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness, she wants to be an oncologist. JosÃ© Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academyâ€™s photography program. But JosÃ© Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family, sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. â€œThey give me my strength, even if I have times I collapse,â€ she said. JosÃ© Jr. agreed. â€œI use my parents and siblings as my motivation,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re all there for each other,â€ Ms. MuÃ±iz said."
21393,"In Europe, Is Uber a Transportation Service or a Digital Platform? - The New York Times",Mark Scott,"Ever since Uber showed up in Europe in late 2011, the American   service has faced vocal opposition. Some of its drivers have been attacked by angry taxi drivers in Paris. Two of the companyâ€™s most senior European executives have stood trial on charges of running an illegal transportation service in France. And taxi associations from London to Frankfurt have accused Uber of flouting local rules and undermining European rivals. The company denies the accusations. These heated battles will culminate on Tuesday in arguments before the European Court of Justice, the regionâ€™s highest court, which will most likely determine how Uber can operate across the European Union, one of the companyâ€™s largest international markets. At stake is the   serviceâ€™s often aggressive worldwide expansion. Uber has opened in more than 300 cities on six continents. That has helped the American tech company reach an   valuation of $68 billion, making it one of the most successful   ever to come out of Silicon Valley. Such rapid growth has often pitted Uber against traditional taxi services and local labor unions, which have accused the company of disregarding working standards and transportation rules. â€œWe will fight against Uber in Germany and across Europe,â€ said Hermann Waldner, the head of a taxi dispatch center in Berlin. â€œWe will try to do what we can to defend ourselves through the law. â€ But as people increasingly turn to services like Uber and rivals like Lyft, policy makers worldwide are starting to question how such businesses in the   sharing economy should be governed. â€œOur role is to encourage a regulatory environment that allows new business models to develop,â€ Jyrki Katainen, the European Commission vice president for jobs, growth investment and competitiveness said this year, before adding that a critical priority was â€œprotecting consumers and ensuring fair taxation and employment conditions. â€ For Uber and its rivals in Europe, the court case represents a watershed moment for how   companies will be able to operate in the region. The hearing relates to a standoff between Uber and a Spanish taxi association, which filed legal proceedings in 2014, claiming unfair competition. Later that year, Uber suspended its services in the country, including its   UberPop offering, which had allowed almost anyone  â€”   after some basic security checks  â€”   to use the companyâ€™s platform to pick up passengers. Uber recently returned to Spain, this time in partnership with licensed taxi drivers. In July 2015, a judge in Barcelona referred the case to the European Court of Justice, asking the   court to determine whether Uber should be treated as a transportation service or merely as a digital platform. If the court decides that Uber is a transportation service, the company will have to obey Europeâ€™s often onerous labor and safety rules, and comply with rules that apply to traditional taxi associations. Though Uber already fulfills such requirements in many European countries, the ruling could hamper its expansion plans. But if the judges rule that Uber is an â€œinformation society service,â€ or an online platform that merely matches independent drivers with potential passengers, then the company will have greater scope to offer   products like UberPop and other services that have been banned in many parts of Europe. â€œThis case should show that European laws fully support the development of a digital single market,â€ Gareth Mead, an Uber spokesman, said in a statement, referring to efforts to reduce barriers that currently restrict the access Europeans have to digital content,   products and other online services. AsociaciÃ³n Profesional Ã‰lite Taxi, the Spanish group that brought the case, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A ruling is not expected before March at the earliest. The judges may decide to consider Uber a transportation service, an online platform, or a combination of the two, further complicating the legal standoff. Other European taxi associations are keeping a close eye on the outcome, which will apply across the   bloc. â€œUber is appealing to Europe at the very moment when Europe is starting to seize upon problems linked to the web,â€ said SÃ©verine Bourlier, secretary general of the National Taxi Union in France. â€œYou can sense that countries are worried, so I think Europe is starting to think about this problem and ways to regulate it. â€ The future of Uberâ€™s European operations has become increasingly important for the company since it sold its   Chinese unit this year to Didi Chuxing, a local rival, after a lengthy price war between the two companies. While Travis Kalanick, Uberâ€™s chief executive, had targeted China for major expansion, the company settled for a minority stake in a combined Chinese operation with Didi Chuxing that is valued at roughly $35 billion. As Uber has grown beyond San Francisco, where it was founded in 2009, it has become embroiled in a number of legal disputes around the world that have challenged its business model and some of its working practices. Last month, for instance, New York State regulators ruled that two former Uber drivers were eligible for unemployment payments, finding that they should be treated as employees rather than independent contractors, as the service had maintained. A British court also recently made a similar ruling, saying that Uber drivers should receive a minimum wage and vacation pay. Mr. Kalanick has been charged in South Korea with running an illegal taxi service, an accusation the company denies, while in India, a former Uber driver was sentenced last year to life in prison for the rape of a passenger. Other   businesses like Airbnb, the vacation rental site, have also been targeted for legal action, particularly in Europe, where traditional hotels have viewed such competition with skepticism. Last week, the city government in Barcelona  â€”   one of Airbnbâ€™s largest markets  â€”   fined the company and its rival, HomeAway, a combined $1. 2 million for advertising and operating vacation rentals without appropriate licenses. BlaBlaCar, a French   service, also was ordered to pay almost $10, 000 to Madridâ€™s regional authorities for operating without required authorization. The companies deny the allegations. Uberâ€™s European legal woes have often set governments against one another, as countries have taken opposing views on how the company should operate. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and countries like Finland and Portugal have supported such new digital services, often proposing new legislation to help them grow locally. But in other countries, notably France and Germany, national politicians have favored rules that have either banned some of Uberâ€™s services or required the company to operate within existing transportation rules. â€œWeâ€™re focused on working within the regulatory environment,â€ said Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, an Uber rival owned by Daimler, the German automaker. â€œWe want to be seen as a constructive disrupter of the industry, not a destroyer of it. â€"
21394,"Fearing Drugsâ€™ Rare Side Effects, Millions Take Their Chances With Osteoporosis - The New York Times",Gina Kolata,"Millions of Americans are missing out on a chance to avoid debilitating fractures from weakened bones, researchers say, because they are terrified of exceedingly rare side effects from drugs that can help them. Reports of the drugsâ€™ causing jawbones to rot and thighbones to snap in two have shaken many osteoporosis patients so much that they say they would rather take their chances with the disease. Use of the most commonly prescribed osteoporosis drugs fell by 50 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a recent paper, and doctors say the trend is continuing. Last month, three professional groups  â€”   the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the National Bone Health Alliance  â€”   put out an urgent call for doctors to be more aggressive in treating patients at high risk, and for patients to be more aware of the need for treatment. It followed a flurry of recent articles in medical journals documenting and bemoaning patientsâ€™ abandonment of traditional osteoporosis drugs. But osteoporosis experts are afraid their efforts will do little to change minds. â€œNinety percent of patients, when you talk to them about starting one of these drugs, wonâ€™t go on,â€ said Dr. Paul D. Miller, medical director of the Colorado Center for Bone Research, a medical practice in Lakewood. â€œNinety percent who are on the drugs want to come off. The fear factor is huge. â€ Half of those who start taking the drugs stop within a year. Even patients who just broke a hip, which makes another hip fracture extremely likely, are refusing them. In 2011, only 20 percent of patients discharged from a hospital with a broken hip had a prescription for one of the drugs, compared with 50 percent in 2002. There is little question that fractures caused by fragile bones are a real problem, particularly for women. A    woman has a 50 percent chance of having an osteoporotic fracture in her remaining years. The drugs, meant to be started when bone density falls very low and the chance of a fracture soars, can reduce that risk by half, studies show. But to many, it matters little that the drugsâ€™ frightening side effects are extremely rare. Estimates are that 10 to 40 in 100, 000 osteoporosis patients taking the drugs  â€”   including alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate and zoledronate  â€”   have sustained broken thighbones. Fewer than one in 100, 000 have had the jawbone problem. â€œYou only need to treat 50 people to prevent a fracture, but you need to treat 40, 000 to see an atypical fracture,â€ said Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, a professor of medicine at Tufts University who has no association with the makers of the drugs. Lawsuits over the rare side effects resulted in large jury awards and drew widespread attention. And after reports of these problems began to surface, the Food and Drug Administration requested that the drugsâ€™ labels include a warning about the association. Doctors had hoped that a new class of medications might avoid the rare side effects, but their hopes were dashed when Amgen announced the same problems in a clinical trial of a drug called romosozumab: a sudden shattering of a thigh bone in one patient and an area of jawbone that inexplicably rotted in two. â€œThis was the new miracle drug,â€ Dr. Rosen said. â€œIt means these effects might occur with any of the newer drugs for osteoporosis. â€ Some patients say that even though their doctors have explained the relative risks to them, the specter of those side effects frightens them. That is what happened with Mildred Canipe, 79, who lives in Charlotte, N. C. She had a spine fracture two years ago and now lives with continual back pain. She worries about another spine fracture or, even worse, a fractured hip. But she resists taking osteoporosis drugs, she said, because she tends to have side effects with almost any drug, and that makes her think that if anyone will suffer an atypical fracture from the medicine, it is she. â€œOf course I am worried about my bones,â€ Mrs. Canipe said. â€œWho wouldnâ€™t be? But I am between a rock and a hard place. â€ She is right to worry about a hip fracture, doctors say. Those injuries are often the start of a downward spiral for older adults. Many never walk normally again. Many end up in nursing homes, unable to care for themselves. â€œYou see someone go from being a mobile elderly person to someone gripping a walker, afraid to move,â€ said Joan A. McGowan, who directs the division of musculoskeletal diseases at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. â€œAnd the less they walk, the more frail they become. â€ Dr. McGowan has no associations with makers of osteoporosis drugs. The pain from spine fractures may improve, but physical disfigurement does not. Many patients with osteoporosis have multiple fractures of their spines. They become hunched and have trouble breathing. Their posture makes it hard for their hearts to pump blood, Dr. McGowan said, adding, â€œItâ€™s not pretty. â€ Yet it is an uphill battle trying to persuade people to take the drugs, said Dr. Steven T. Harris, an osteoporosis specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. â€œI have that discussion all day every day with my patients,â€ he said. One issue, Dr. Harris said, is the relentless promotion of diet and exercise for patients with fragile bones, which, he said, is insufficient to protect them from fractures. It gives people a false sense that they can control their risk. Another, said Dr. Ethel S. Siris, an osteoporosis expert at Columbia, is that with the drugs off patent, there is no longer an aggressive advertising push to make people aware of them. Their cost ranges from less than $10 a month for alendronate pills to about $1, 200 for a    infusion of zoledronate. Doctors who have seen one of the rare patients who have an atypical fracture are shaken by the experience and have to remind themselves of the power of the data showing that the drugsâ€™ benefits far outweigh their risks. Dr. Elaine Carlson, who until her recent retirement practiced internal medicine in Kennebunk, Me. had a patient who sustained two such fractures. The patient, 89, who asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy, said her left leg had broken suddenly when she was walking across her kitchen floor. A surgeon put in a rod and three screws, and it healed. Then, she said, her right thigh began to hurt six months later. She called Dr. Carlsonâ€™s office and was talking to her nurse practitioner when suddenly her right leg broke. She saw three doctors and had two operations before it healed, but she still cannot walk normally and can no longer do the gardening she loves. â€œI hobble around on a cane,â€ she said. â€œI am a cripple. â€ She called the drug she took for osteoporosis â€œthat wretched, dreadful stuff. â€ Having that happen to her patient was â€œvery tough, very tough,â€ Dr. Carlson said. And when the next osteoporosis patient came to her office? â€œYeah, you do hesitate,â€ she said. â€œYour job is â€˜do no harm. â€™â€ But Dr. Carlson said she had continued to prescribe the drugs. â€œYou do have to stick with the science,â€ she said."
21395,A Car Accident Throws a Productive Life Into Turmoil - The New York Times,John Otis,"Fresh from a promising meeting with a real estate agent, David Nublett was on his way to treat himself to a new pair of shoes when he started to walk across Westchester Avenue in the Bronx. That is the last thing he remembers. Mr. Nublett later woke up in a state of delirium at a hospital. Tubes were inside him. A doctor was snapping his left shoulder back into joint another told him if they did not perform emergency surgery to remove his spleen, he could die. â€œYou wake up and theyâ€™re ready to cut you open,â€ Mr. Nublett recalled, his voice strained. â€œItâ€™s like â€˜The Twilight Zone. â€™â€ He was struck by a car that morning in February 2012. He spent the next two months at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx. Years later, after multiple surgeries, Mr. Nublett, 57, still has five pins in his shoulder, a metal plate in his ribs and a shattered left knee. He struggles to walk. He has developed high blood pressure, diabetes and severe anxiety. â€œI shouldnâ€™t be here,â€ Mr. Nublett said, an anguished refrain he often repeated. Before the accident, Mr. Nublett worked two jobs, in maintenance and in security. He was   and frugal. Now he cannot work at all. Mr. Nublett said the driverâ€™s liability insurance covered his medical bills, but left him with no compensation to make up for what has become years of lost wages. The catastrophe not only stripped him of his mobility and independence, but also decimated his life savings. â€œI have to start all over again, like a baby,â€ he said. His monthly income consists of $987 a month in Social Security disability, enough to cover the rent for his Bronx apartment. He also receives $194 in food stamps. Desperation compelled him to beg strangers for help. â€œYou feel less than a man when you do this,â€ he said. â€œWhen you ask people for change, you feel less than a man. â€ After falling $3, 589. 40 behind in rent, he turned to Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Timesâ€™s Neediest Cases Fund. Catholic Charities worked with other groups to cover his arrears. They used $347 in Neediest Cases money to buy Mr. Nublett a kitchen table, chairs, a dresser and a medicine cabinet to help him organize and thrive in his apartment, which he can rarely leave. Mr. Nublett, who uses a wheelchair, a walker and a cane to get around, lives in a     apartment. Venturing outside is an exhausting, painstaking process. He does so only to see doctors or physical therapists. â€œI got to sit here and watch TV all day with a pillow behind my head like some old dude,â€ he said. Catholic Charities has applied for a   exemption and is trying to secure him a   apartment in his building. Mr. Nublettâ€™s physical ailments keep him inside, which only worsens the psychological pain of confinement, he said. He has few ways to keep from dwelling on his misfortune and the inequity of having his life change so radically. Conventional forms of escapism do nothing for him. â€œMusic soothes the savage beast or whatever,â€ Mr. Nublett said. â€œBut when you listen, you just think about what youâ€™re going through. â€ Friends have fallen away, visiting much less and looking at him with pity when they do, he said. No family members live in New York State. Other close family members are deceased. His neighbors are friendly, he said, but have not helped him navigate his new life. His only consistent companion is his home health care aide. The medication Mr. Nublett sometimes takes for his anxiety makes him drowsy. He has grown accustomed to that state of consciousness at times, mentally drifting away and pondering the unanswerable question, â€œWhy me?â€ â€œThe only bad things I did was curse, and we all do that when the game comes on,â€ Mr. Nublett said. He has always followed rules and adhered to a rigid code of right and wrong, taught to him by his mother and his faith. But now, Mr. Nublett struggles to understand the feeling of being inexplicably punished. â€œI shouldnâ€™t be here,â€ he said. â€œWhat about the bad guys that walk around the streets? There are guys out there who are worse. These guys are still walking the streets, theyâ€™re still walking. â€ Additional surgeries are pending, including for a replacement for his left knee. Mr. Nublett is praying that he will be able to get back on his feet at long last. â€œI want to go back outside again and cross the street,â€ Mr. Nublett said. â€œI want to catch a train again, sit down and have a bite to eat. Go to work like everybody else. â€ That is where he should be, he said. Not taking pills, receiving injections and fending off panic attacks. Not fighting loneliness and despair, as he spends every day on the couch. He should not be here."
21396,What to Know About Trumpâ€™s Order to Dismantle the Clean Power Plan - The New York Times,Tatiana Schlossberg,"President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that calls on Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to take steps to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, a set of rules regulating energy plants powered by fossil fuels. The plan, which would have regulated carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil   electricity plants, has been tied up in courts for more than a year, after more two dozen states, industry representatives and others sued the E. P. A. They claimed that the plan was unconstitutional, and it hadnâ€™t yet taken effect because the Supreme Court had said the plan could not be carried out while it was being argued before a lower federal court. Mr. Trump criticized the Clean Power Plan during the campaign and promised to bring back coal mining jobs and create new jobs in the fossil fuel industry the rules would have made that more difficult. Mr. Pruitt, as Oklahomaâ€™s attorney general, sued the E. P. A. 14 times over environmental regulations, including the Clean Power Plan. The problem for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt is that, if they get rid of this plan, they are legally required to come up with another one. Plus, in order to repeal regulations, federal agencies have to follow the same   system (requiring periods of public notice and comment) used to create regulations, which can take about a year. Keep in mind that 18 state attorneys general and several environmental advocacy groups had previously moved to defend the rule, and they may challenge whatever alternative Mr. Pruitt might devise. Some of the arguments against the Clean Power Plan have come from the fossil fuel industries  â€”   specifically the coal industry, since   power plants are the main target of the rules. They have argued that the plan is overly punitive toward them. However, the proliferation of cheap natural gas and a rise in renewable energy sources have made coal less financially sustainable. Removing regulations on   power plants wouldnâ€™t necessarily bring back a lot of coal jobs. Most coal mining, especially mountaintop removal mining, is done by machines, so it would be hard to bring back the thousands of jobs that have been lost as coal becomes less and less profitable. And opening up more federal lands and waters to fossil fuel extraction might lead to a glut of coal in the market, which could make it even less financially viable than it is now. The Obama administration used the creation of the Clean Power Plan to show other countries that the United States was serious about taking meaningful action on climate change during the Paris climate talks in late 2015. The plan is the most significant part of the strategy to cut emissions by the amount specified in the Paris agreement. Even with the Clean Power Plan in effect, it would have been tough for the United States to meet its Paris agreement targets. Without the plan or another one at least as stringent on greenhouse gases, it will be nearly impossible, experts say. If the rule is completely abandoned and no comparable alternative is offered, it might signal to the rest of the world that the United States isnâ€™t serious about its obligations under the Paris agreement (which Mr. Trump has also said he would â€œcancel,â€ though there is disagreement about that in his cabinet). That might make other countries feel less bound by the terms of the agreement, too."

21399,California Official Says Trumpâ€™s Claim of Voter Fraud Is â€˜Absurdâ€™ - The New York Times,Adam Nagourney,"LOS ANGELES  â€”   When   Donald J. Trump claimed on Twitter that he was losing the popular vote because of major fraud by millions of voters, one of the states he pointed to was California, where the latest voting returns showed Hillary Clinton, the Democrat, crushing Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trumpâ€™s baseless claim led to a furious reaction from Californiaâ€™s top election official, Alex Padilla, the secretary of state, this weekend. Mr. Padilla asserted that there was no evidence for the claim by the   and denounced Mr. Trump for what he said was unpresidential behavior. â€œHis unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd,â€ Mr. Padilla posted on Twitter. â€œHis reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a  . â€ This state has historically been slow to count ballots, a reflection of both its vast size and inefficiencies in many county voting operations. Given the fact that this is an overwhelmingly Democratic state, that has meant that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s total vote count has grown steadily as ballots were tallied, adding to a national lead of close to two million votes. As of Saturday, Mrs. Clinton had 8. 1 million votes in California, compared with 4. 2 million for Mr. Trump, according to the secretary of stateâ€™s office. It was not clear when the vote count might be concluded. The count, and outcome, has been no surprise to anyone in a state with a history of slow  . Officials in both parties had predicted this would happen as early as election night. Given Californiaâ€™s long Democratic history, it was never in play during this presidential election. But as the nationâ€™s most populated state, it tends to have a significant influence on final national voting margins, as is apparently the case this year. Mr. Trump signaled out three states in his post of Twitter on â€œserious voter fraudâ€  â€”   Virginia, New Hampshire and California. He offered no evidence to back up the claim. His remarks came as he denounced calls for a recount in three states that he won by relatively small margins: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Jill Stein, who was the Green Party candidate for president, said that she would move for a recount. Aides to Mrs. Clinton said they would cooperate with the effort, even as they made it clear they thought it would not change the outcome. Mr. Padilla is the   Latino elected to state office in California. Mr. Trumpâ€™s poor showing here, many Democrats and Republicans said, came in no small part because of his attacks on what he described as the threat of illegal immigration  â€”   particularly by Mexicans.

21400,Putin: Trump Win Is A Massive Defeat For New World Order,Starkman,"Russia is hoping for a â€œnew understandingâ€ and â€œrestored Russian-American relationsâ€ according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be â€œencouragedâ€ by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government. 
Via Yournewswire 
According to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalistsâ€™ destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand.
â€œThe American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change.â€
Putin vowed to destroy the New World Order in 2016, and it appears people all over the world have started to wake up and resonate with his goal. The President is â€œdeeply encouragedâ€ that his determination to destroy the invasive organisationâ€™s agenda is shared by people all over the world, and gaining momentum all the time.
This election result represents the biggest uprising by the American people against the elite who run the country since the Boston Tea Party in 1771, and the New World Order controlled puppets in Washington are reeling. All of the elite â€“ politicians, bankers, economists, celebrities â€“ told the people to vote for the NWO selected candidate, Hillary Clinton. But the people are waking up. The people said no.
The Rothschild NWO cabal will be pacing nervously in their mansions, wondering how to deal with this massive, unexpected blow to their globalist agenda. Their roadmap to arriving at a one world government â€“ so close, yet so far away â€“ has been thrown off course by this uprising of the people.
In an annual press conference with his countrymen last April, Putin expressed skepticism about the American electoral process, which he believes is corrupt â€“ elite family clans taking turns occupying the White House. He also hinted at how he personally saw Hillary Clinton.
â€œFirst there was Bush senior in power, then Bush junior. [Bill] Clinton was[U.S. President] two times in a row, now his wife has ambitions. Again, the family might stay in power. As they say in Russia, a husband and a wife are the same Satan.â€
Neither side of the political establishment wanted Trump anywhere near the White House. The mainstream media were vilifying him. In short, the sock puppets of the New World Order were united against him. They have a lot to lose if somebody who isnâ€™t playing by their rules takes control â€“ and their nightmare has come true.
Do not be surprised if the mainstream media attempt to convince you of something deeply disturbing in the near future. Never in history has the NWO had such a firm grip on mainstream media operations.
The New World Order controlled elites in Washington did not expect this blow and they will be a scrambling to take back control.
Triggered by a massive popular uprising, stoked by wholly rational fears, and fired up by hard facts, America has regained its status as a powerful, sovereign nation. The people chose to make the United States powerful again, to take control of their economy, and make themselves respected in the eyes of the world. They have taken the bull by the horns and backed themselves as American. They have voted for advance over stagnation. It is the answer for our times.

21401,Amazon Increases Robotic Workforce by 50% - Breitbart,Nate Church,"In the last year, Amazon has dramatically increased employment of robots, going from 30, 000 robots in 2015 to 45, 000 in 2016. [When Amazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, they immediately began implementing the squat automatons into their network of massive warehouses. The 16 inch, 320 lb. machines can carry more than twice their own weight and have taken over a sizable chunk of transport and packing tasks.  For now, the increase in robotic employment at Amazon is only outpacing actual people by a narrow margin  â€”   50% as opposed to 46% more humans, according to The Seattle Times. Human awareness and dexterity still prevent us from becoming a redundant part of these processes  â€¦     for now, as white collar insurance claims agents are being replaced with AI and the development of   synthetic muscle that could make robots as graceful as any person. Amazon is perhaps the biggest company leading the charge toward an automated workforce, in the process of hashing out ideas that range from drone delivery services to the flying motherships that could someday house them. According to Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky, â€œ[Amazon has] changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times, and we continue to learn and grow there. â€ Theyâ€™re already running an Amazon storefront without a single cashier, and their latest corporate campus in Seattle is being built inside of biospheres. Weâ€™re constantly seeing news about Amazonâ€™s relentless march into new territory, and the pace continues to increase. Iâ€™m not sure whether to buy stock, or build a fallout shelter. Just to be sure, maybe Iâ€™ll ask Watson. Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both."
21402,World Animal Population To Be Down By Two-Thirds In 2020,Brandon Turbeville,"Natural Blaze As if the November elections werenâ€™t bad enough news for the world, a new report by the Living Planet Index was recently released that contains very frightening visions for the future.
According to the report, the number of living wild animals is expected to fall by two-thirds by 2020 from its 1970 levels. The report suggests that this massive disappearance is actually part of a mass extinction that will have effects that reach every corner of the globe and ultimately destroying the natural world and thus, humanity itself. 
The report is considered the most comprehensive analysis published so far by many experts. It points out that animal populations between 1970 and 2012 declined by 58 percent and that by 2020 it is projected to reach 67 percent. 
In other words, we are in the midst of a mass die-off and only four years away from seeing an irreparable amount of damage to the natural world. 
Researchers from the World Wildlife Fund (an admittedly questionable organization) and the Zoological Society of London were responsible for compiling the report drawn from various data sources and determined that pollution, over-hunting/fishing and the destruction of wild habitats were to blame. 
Not only endangered species like elephants and gorillas are in danger, however. For instance, vultures and salamanders appear to be on their way to extinction and the animals at risk reside in forests, jungles, mountains, deserts, rivers and oceans. 
According to the Guardian , 
The report analysed the changing abundance of more than 14,000 monitored populations of the 3,700 vertebrate species for which good data is available. This produced a measure akin to a stock market index that indicates the state of the worldâ€™s 64,000 animal species and is used by scientists to measure the progress of conservation efforts. 
According to the report, logging and the destructing of natural habitats for farming purposes are the biggest cause of animal deaths. Poaching and over fishing and over-hunting for food are other major causes. 
Recent research shows that 300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction . 
Pollution is also an obvious significant factor. 
For instance, dolphins and killer whales in European seas are being killed by the presence of industrial chemicals. In Southeast Asia the vulture population has been decimated for two decades due to the fact that the birds are dying after eating cattle carcasses of cows who had been treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Fungal diseases are having a horrific effect on the amphibian population â€“ a disaster that many believe to be caused by world trade of frogs and newts. 
Rivers and lakes are having the most dramatic declines. Here, animal populations are down 81% since 1970. 
As Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF, said: 
The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse. 
While Westerners wring their hands and obsess over CO2, they continue to ignore real environmental catastrophes like industrial chemical pollution, over-fishing, loss of biodiversity through genetic modification and unsustainable farming. 
If the world wants to survive 21st century, it will immediately begin to look at ways in which development and higher living standards can be produced while at the same time ensuring that the natural world is protected. 
At this point, we have no other choice."
21403,Michael Moore: People Voting Trump As â€œUltimate Fâ€“â€“ Youâ€¦ A Human Molotov Cocktailâ€,Mac Slavo,"Email 
A tidal wave is coming. 
Michael Moore, a liberalâ€™s liberal who holds die-hard loyalty to Hillary Clinton , is acknowledging what everyone with a clear head recognizes: that she doesnâ€™t even remotely connect with the average voter, doesnâ€™t understand their problems â€“ and above all, doesnâ€™t care about them. 
Although Moore canâ€™t support Donald Trump , he seems to admire his ability to resonate with the actual problems that the people who formerly made up the middle class are going through â€“ economic and otherwise. Moore, like Trump, understands the pulse of the people, though they differ in just about every other way. 
This election represents a pivotal point, and an end of the line for the deal that people once held with their leaders. After decades of broken promises and deals to sell them short and sell them out, people have had enough. 
THATâ€™S what this election is about. 
Right or wrong, Trump represents a rebuke of the system â€“ as Moore calls it, the ultimate â€œFâ€“â€“â€“ Youâ€ ever directed at the system. 
Listen to the audio of what Moore said ( Warning: Foul Language ): 
Hereâ€™s some of what he said in an epic rant (reportedly excerpted from his rush-election film Trumpland) that is strangely validating of Trumpâ€™s entire campaign: 
Whether Trump means it or not, itâ€™s kind of irrelevant because heâ€™s saying the things that people who are hurting. And itâ€™s why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle-class loves Trump. 
â€œTheyâ€™re not racists or rednecks, theyâ€™re actually pretty decent people. So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.â€ 
[â€¦] 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobodyâ€™s going to buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician â€” Republican or Democrat â€” had ever said anything like that to these executives. It was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about. 
He is the human Molotov cocktail that they have been waiting for. The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th â€” Election Day â€” although they have lost their jobs. Although theyâ€™ve been foreclosed on by the bank. Next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone. The carâ€™s been repossessed. They havenâ€™t had a real vacation in years. Theyâ€™re stuck with the shitty Obamacare bronze plan. They canâ€™t even get a f**king percocet. 
They have essentially lost everything they hadâ€¦except one thing. The one thing that doesnâ€™t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution: the right to vote. 
[â€¦] So, on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, take that lever â€” or felt pen or touchscreen â€” and put a big f**king X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. 
[â€¦] 
They see that the elites who have ruined their lives hate Trump. 
Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The Media hates Trumpâ€¦ 
The enemy of my enemy is who I am voting for on November 8th. 
Trumpâ€™s election is going to be the biggest F**K YOU ever recorded in human history. 
And it will feel good. 
What red-blooded American, working stiff or laid off schmo wouldnâ€™t want to stick it to the establishment and rebuke the very system that brought them to this point? After all, it is their fault. 
People have been hurting and in decline for eight long years â€“ and for all his smiles and posturing, Obama hasnâ€™t done a damned thing. And Hillary canâ€™t even pretend. 
The people who will be deciding the popular vote in this election want to take down that system and put someone in who will â€“ once and for all â€“ stand up for them. Basically, Americans want revenge. 
What the electoral college decides is another matter altogether, of course.

21404,Yahoo and the Online Universe According to Verizon - The New York Times,David Gelles,"Verizon Communicationsâ€™ $4. 83 billion acquisition of Yahoo has the technology cognoscenti scratching their heads. What does Verizon, the countryâ€™s biggest wireless company, see in an internet  ? Fortune criticized â€œThe Problem With  . â€  â€™s chief executive, John Legere, derided the deal as a â€œslippery slope. â€ The chief executive of Sprint, Marcelo Claure, said that when telecommunications companies try to get into the content business, â€œhistory has proven that every single one of them has failed. â€ And there are reasons to think history might repeat itself. Yahoo will be merged with AOL, another faded star of Web 1. 0 that Verizon bought last year. These brands from yesterday are supposed to compete for the same advertising dollars that titans like Google and Facebook are devouring faster than ever. Still, there is a surprisingly ambitious, and risky, unifying theme hidden in the oddball assortment of websites and internet services that Verizon has acquired over the last year or so: The company is rethinking who its customer actually is. It is imagining a future when its most important client may not be a mother signing up for a family cellphone plan in the Verizon store. Instead, the customer will be corporations  â€”   advertisers  â€”   that want to reach that family, and that are willing to pay Verizon to help them do so. â€œTheir goal is not to appeal to users in a different way,â€ said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. â€œItâ€™s to appeal to advertisers in a different way. â€ It represents a profound philosophical shift for a company that traces its roots back to historyâ€™s first telephone call. And whether or not it succeeds, it could have ramifications for tech, media and advertising companies around the globe. Already, it is drawing Verizon into new controversies around privacy and net neutrality. But executives prefer to emphasize other aspects of their idea. They talk up how Verizonâ€™s existing assets  â€”   phone and data networks that knit together the nation  â€”   might be paired with its new media properties, which include The Huffington Post and Style Me Pretty, a website â€œfor the modern bride. â€ Location information from wireless customers could mean better geolocated ads for smartphone users. National Football League games licensed for viewing on smartphones might be streamed on Yahoo sites as well  â€”   all in the service of selling ads. Taken together, Yahoo, AOL and Verizonâ€™s other websites still reach more than a billion users a month, a significant number even in Silicon Valley. And Verizon is eager to change the narrative. For six and a half contentious weeks this spring, the company was ensnared in a nasty labor battle with the unions representing nearly 40, 000 workers who service its landlines. Picketers massed outside Verizon stores. Workers held a candlelight vigil at the home of Verizonâ€™s chief executive. Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of â€œcorporate greed. â€ The Labor secretary finally brokered a truce. Everything about the   street fight was at odds with the kind of company Verizon has been spending billions of dollars trying to become. Yet change will come slowly for a company as big as Verizon. Valued at roughly $225 billion, Verizon is one of the 15 largest companies in the country by sales. Annual revenues exceed $130 billion and the work force is 160, 000. Verizon is now the biggest wireless company in the country, selling voice and data plans to roughly one in three Americans. That is more precarious than it might sound. While Verizon is still adding wireless customers, its sales are no longer growing. Price wars with ATT, Sprint and   have limited how much Verizon can charge. This week, the company reported a rare decline in quarterly revenues. Profits were down too, hurt by the strike. This dynamic is unlikely to change soon. If Verizon remains a traditional telecommunications company, it is likely to face years of eroding sales and slumping profits. Thatâ€™s why Lowell McAdam, Verizonâ€™s chief executive, is trying to buy his way into the plump and growing market for digital advertising. â€œItâ€™s empire retention,â€ said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. If Verizon has its way, it will cast off its reputation as a big, boring telephone company battling a unionized work force and emerge as a digital media player mentioned in the same breath as Snapchat and PokÃ©mon. Itâ€™s quite the pivot. At first glance, the acquisitions have almost nothing to do with Verizonâ€™s main moneymaking activity  â€”   selling data plans to its roughly 110 million cellphone customers. â€œThereâ€™s not really any synergy between Verizonâ€™s core business and the AOL and Yahoo play,â€ Mr. Wieser said. Yet even before it scooped up AOL and Yahoo, Verizon set about trying to remake itself. In recent years, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on deals. Some have been successful. EdgeCast and UpLynk, companies that serve video content and video advertising, still have growing revenues. A decade ago Verizon launched Fios, an expensive landline cable television and internet service. In doing so, it was taking on established cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Today, Fios has gained 5. 5 million customers, and the business brings in about $10 billion a year. But other new ventures havenâ€™t panned out. CloudSwitch and Terremark, two recent acquisitions, were meant to be the foundation for Verizonâ€™s push into cloud computing, a growing industry dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. This year, Verizon pulled back on its cloud businesses, ceding ground in one of the most lucrative new industries in computing. Whether or not Yahoo and AOL can give Mr. McAdam the growth he needs isnâ€™t clear. Though the companies arenâ€™t in the same class as Facebook and Google, they wouldnâ€™t have to improve much to start making a difference at Verizon. Even if Verizon captured just 2 percent more of the global market for digital advertising, that would add more than $3 billion to the companyâ€™s annual sales. â€œThis industry is so big and itâ€™s so new,â€ said Tim Armstrong, AOLâ€™s chief executive, who will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo. â€œPeople act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future. â€ Mr. Armstrongâ€™s answer to Facebook and Google is hardly a sure thing. Verizonâ€™s forays have already landed the company in hot water. This year Verizon settled with the Federal Communications Commission after the company used   â€œsupercookiesâ€  â€”   an extremely    technology  â€”   to track the web browsing of its wireless customers. Though some version of this practice is commonplace, Verizon made the browsing data available to other companies. As part of the settlement, Verizon agreed to notify customers about its targeting advertising programs and pay a $1. 35 million fine. The episode left privacy watchdogs wary of how Verizon would handle user data as its reach across the web grew. â€œThere is some concern, especially given how reluctant Verizon was to own up to the issue with the supercookies,â€ said Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. â€œIt would be one thing if they had just owned up to it. â€ Giving advertisers access to smartphone usersâ€™ data without their knowledge could also be a problem for Verizon. â€œThereâ€™s the potential for using the consumer data they have, but they have to tread a fine line,â€ Mr. Wieser said. â€œEven if they get a user to opt in, it doesnâ€™t take many complaints to get hauled before the F. C. C. â€ And in recent months, Verizon has come under fire for possible violations of net neutrality rules. In February, it emerged that Verizon had stopped charging its wireless customers for data if they were streaming video from Go90, a   site, leading to scrutiny from the tech press. â€œThis sort of clearly favoring your own content raises all sorts of net neutrality concerns,â€ Mr. Gillula said. Yahoo has popular franchises in sports and finance, and a   home page. AOL continues to draw users, and also serves the ads for MSN, the Microsoft portal, which still attracts visitors. Additionally, Verizon now owns the Go90 video site and AOL sites including TechCrunch, and it   Complex, a menâ€™s lifestyle website. Verizon has other plans as well. Mr. Armstrong said the goal was to amass an audience of two billion by 2020, and said the company was likely to continue buying websites. He promoted   advertising informed by the movements of Verizonâ€™s wireless subscribers, the potential for the companies to make money off the   internet of things  â€”   where your dishwasher or doorbell is connected to the web  â€”   augmented and virtual reality, and connected cars. â€œThereâ€™s a tremendous growth opportunity,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re in the right industry. â€ Advertisers, worried that Google and Facebook are effectively becoming a duopoly, might bite. â€œWith Facebook and Google taking an estimated 78 cents of every new digital dollar spent, having a viable third option is welcome,â€ said Joe Marchese, president of advanced ad products at Fox Networks. â€œAdvertisers want to make it work,â€ Mr. Wieser said. â€œThereâ€™s really interest in supporting and propping up a   No. 3. â€ Yet for Verizon to believe it will have an easy path is â€œwillful optimism,â€ Mr. Wieser said. It ignores Google and Facebookâ€™s dominance of online advertising. Together the Silicon Valley rivals control nearly half of the worldwide online ad market, generating close to $80 billion in sales. In recent days both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported healthy quarterly results, suggesting that they are only growing stronger. At the least, Verizon appears to have gotten a good deal. It paid less than $9 billion for both AOL and Yahoo. That is a relatively insignificant sum for Verizon, which takes in more than that each month. And for that price, it obtained about 1. 2 billion active users that it can use to lure advertisers. Whatâ€™s more, AOL and Yahoo already generate about $7 billion in revenue annually. Compare that with LinkedIn, which had annual revenue of $3 billion, and was just sold to Microsoft for $26 billion. Or to Twitter, which had just over $2 billion in sales last year and is valued at about $12 billion. And even if Verizonâ€™s push into digital media doesnâ€™t transform the company, it has finally achieved what many knew was inevitable, but no one could previously achieve: the union of AOL and Yahoo. For years, AOL and Yahoo orbited each other like two dying stars. Rumors that one would buy the other were constant. But egos, activist investors and fluctuating share prices prevented the companies from going through with the union. â€œThereâ€™s been a lot of people with a lot of ideas about doing this over a long time,â€ said Mr. Armstrong, the AOL chief. He added that he had been aware of discussions about such a deal for more than a decade. How the companies will be integrated remains to be seen. But most analysts expect Mr. Armstrong to run the combined operation. What that means for Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, isnâ€™t clear. Big personalities aside, the true test will be whether AOL, Yahoo and the growing assortment of online properties Verizon is amassing can give Mr. McAdam the revenue increase he needs to please Wall Street. So far, there appears to be reason for some hope. Though Verizon doesnâ€™t regularly break out AOLâ€™s revenue, it said this week that the unit had $713 million in sales last quarter. This suggests that Verizon has managed to lift AOL revenue modestly over the last year. Doing the same for Yahoo, which was reporting steadily deteriorating revenue before the sale to Verizon, may be tougher. â€œOn paper, the strategy makes sense,â€ Mr. Moffett said. â€œBut executing is incredibly hard, and whether they chose the right set of assets is an open question. â€"

21406,British Decision on Nuclear Plant Angers China and France - The New York Times,Steven Erlanger,"LONDON  â€”   The decision of the new British government to postpone a deal on a nuclear power station, to be built by France with major Chinese investment, has shocked both of those countries and is a potentially major step away from the policies of former Prime Minister David Cameron. The sudden choice of Prime Minister Theresa May not to sign the deal but to take until the autumn for further study, reportedly on security and economic grounds, has angered both Paris, which will be crucial to Britainâ€™s future relations with the European Union after the countryâ€™s vote to leave the bloc, and Beijing, which Mr. Cameron had cultivated aggressively for investment and trade ties despite criticism that he was subordinating human rights and geopolitical concerns to commerce. The menu had already been published for a grand lunch after a signing ceremony last Friday on the Somerset coast, the site of the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is designed to produce 3, 200 megawatts with two new French reactors at a cost of at least 18 billion pounds, about $23. 7 billion. The day before, the board of the largely   EDF, the French power utility, voted 10 to 7 to approve Hinkley Point, despite serious concerns about the ability of the company to handle the project and its costs. But late Thursday night, Downing Street said it would not sign the deal the next day as planned. Travel by French and Chinese officials to Somerset for the party was canceled, and the â€œhoi sin local lamb skewersâ€ and mackerel ceviche had to be abandoned. While Downing Street said that Mrs. May had told President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France the week before that she would postpone the deal, the board of EDF was taken by surprise.   LÃ©vy, the companyâ€™s chief executive, said he had been unaware of the British hesitation before the boardâ€™s vote and found out about it during a newspaper interview. Mrs. May told Mr. Hollande that her new government wanted to look at the deal again, as any new government would. But since then it has become clear that her main concerns are with the Chinese involvement, and she seemed to be signaling an end to the British willingness to be Chinaâ€™s best Western ally in return for Chinese investment. Having served as home secretary for six years before becoming prime minister, Mrs. May is security minded and had expressed concerns in cabinet meetings during the Cameron administration about bringing Beijing into such a sensitive project. The project is meant to provide about 7 percent of Britainâ€™s electricity needs. She was also reported to have been unhappy on security grounds when British Telecom agreed to a deal with the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. While China is funding just over a third of the Hinkley Point project, the real advantage for Beijing is that the deal offers China a chance to build and operate a nuclear power plant of its own design at another site in Britain, at    in Essex. That reportedly troubles Mrs. May because it could give China control over an important part of Britainâ€™s energy supply. On Monday, China reacted angrily to suggestions that its investment in the project threatened British security. The official Xinhua news agency published a commentary arguing that the delay â€œadds uncertainties to the â€˜Golden Eraâ€™ of  . K. tiesâ€ and suggesting that further Chinese investment in Britain could be rethought. â€œChina can wait for a rational British government to make responsible decisions, but cannot tolerate any unwanted accusation against its sincere and benign willingness for   cooperation,â€ the commentary said. Mr. Cameron and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, had made a big pitch for closer economic and   ties with China, including a   state visit last October by President Xi Jinping. The British decision in March 2015 to become the first Western country to join Chinaâ€™s rival to the World Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, shocked the Obama administration. The Hinkley Point C project is still expected to go ahead at this point, especially given the added British jobs. But Mrs. May could try to alter Chinaâ€™s role. The delay was interpreted as a message to Beijing and Washington that her position toward China is more skeptical than that of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne, who had aspirations of becoming prime minister but whom she fired from government. On Monday, Helen Bower, a spokeswoman for Mrs. May, said that Britain did not want a break with Beijing. â€œWith the role China has to play on world affairs, on the global economy, on a whole range of international issues, we are going to continue to seek a strong relationship with China,â€ she said. As for France, Mr. Hollande has near record disapproval ratings in the polls and faces elections in May. He has pushed for EDF to win the project as a needed lift for the countryâ€™s nuclear industry, which has suffered since the disaster at Fukushima in Japan. This   pressurized water reactor is complex, and the company has experienced construction problems and severe cost overruns as it tries to finish the first ones in Finland and Flamanville, France. EDF unions, some board members, engineers and senior executives have expressed deep reservations over the financial risks the construction of the reactor entailed for the indebted power company."
21407,Julian Assange Says Trump 'Won't be Allowed to Win'      : Information,Darren Boyle," Julian Assange Says Trump 'Won't be Allowed to Win'
By Darren Boyle
 "" Daily Mail "" - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has claimed Donald Trump 'won't be allowed to win' next week's election during an interview to be broadcast on a pro-Kremlin TV station.
The Australian computer hacker was speaking from inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he also accused Hillary Clinton of receiving donations from the same people funding ISIS .
Assange said he was basing his claims on emails released last month by WikiLeaks.
Speaking to Australian journalist John Pilger for Dartmouth Films, Assange claimed one of the leaked documents between showed a message sent by the then Secretary of State to John Podesta, who was an adviser to President Barack Obama.
Assange said the email urged Obama to 'bring pressure' on the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, 'which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups'.
He described the email as the 'most important' in the entire collection.
He claimed: 'All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some Â“rogueÂ” princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.'
Clinton has also been criticized over claims that the Clinton Foundation receives funding from Saudi and Qatari sources.
Later in the 25-minute interview, which will be broadcast on Russia Today, Assange claims next Tuesday's presidential election has been fixed in favour of Hillary Clinton.
He added: 'My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.'
Donald Trump has repeatedly said Tuesday's presidential election may be rigged, while providing scant evidence, and has urged supporters to keep an eye out for signs of voting fraud in Philadelphia and other heavily Democratic areas.
Democrats worry that could encourage Trump supporters to harass minority voters in a state that could determine whether Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the presidency. Voting-rights advocates said they are already receiving reports of harassment.
Democrats have launched a legal blitz of their own in an attempt to shut down Trump's poll-watching efforts in Pennsylvania and three other battleground states, arguing in lawsuits that Republican monitoring efforts amount to 'vigilante voter intimidation' that violates federal law.
Assange earlier denied he was a stooge for the Russian intelligence services, claiming they were not behind the damaging leaks to the Clinton campaign.
He has been wanted by Swedish authorities since 2010 over rape allegations.
He has been hiding the the Ecuadorian embassy in London over fears he will be extradited to the United States.
He said: 'The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything.
'Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That's false Â– we can say that the Russian government is not the source.'
The first tranche of emails published by WikiLeaks claimed the Democratic party leadership actively favored Clinton over her rival for the nomination Bernie Sanders.
The Department of Homeland Security Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said last month they were 'confident' the Russian government was responsible for the leaks.
But Russia has denied this and presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said it was 'nonsense'.
In an interview with veteran John Pilger on RT, Assange said: 'We have independently authenticated the emails. WikiLeaks has a decade-long, perfect record in the accurate authentication of leaked documents.'

21408,"Your Weekend Briefing: Transgender Rights, Donald Trump, Doping - The New York Times",Andrea Kannapell and Andrew Hinderaker,"Here are the weekâ€™s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. The Obama administration made its stance on transgender rights clear to public schools across the country, sending a letter telling districts to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity. The directive isnâ€™t a law, but the threat of lawsuits or loss of federal aid is implicit. The move came at the end of a week that also saw the Justice Department and North Carolina sue one another over access to public restrooms. _____ 2. Donald Trump dominated campaign news, both in political maneuvering on Capitol Hill and seamier stories  â€”   like a former butler threatening to lynch President Obama and his contradictory relationships with women. The sheer volume of such reports may be dulling their impact. â€œHe moves so quick and creates outrages so fast, you almost forget what happened,â€ a Republican strategist said. _____ 3. On the Democratic side of the presidential contest, some supporters of Bernie Sanders are working on a proposal that he suspend his campaign after the June 7 California primary, concede to Hillary Clinton and use his popularity to focus his efforts on helping defeat Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Sanders rejected the idea. _____ 4. The leadership struggle in Brazil turned decisive, as the Senate suspended President Dilma Rousseff to try her for fiscal skullduggery. The move could push the country, a bastion of the South American left, farther to the right. _____ 5. Did Russia cheat to be the top   at the 2014 Olympics at Sochi? A former Russian official said he had overseen a vast doping program, years in the making, and that at Sochi, his team was able to access urine samples through a hole in a wall, open supposedly     bottles and replace dozens of athletesâ€™ tainted samples with clean urine. Russia denounced the account. _____ 6. Years of debate within the White House ended in an announcement that, yes, President Obama would visit Hiroshima. In less than two weeks, he will become the first sitting U. S. president to visit the memorial to the victims of the atomic bombs the U. S. dropped on Japan in World War II. The two countries, now allies, still tend to see the other as failing to fully accept its responsibility. _____ 7. Forget the fountain of youth: Scientists are working on a second skin to erase the effects of aging. The invisible film has been successful, in small studies, at making undereye bags vanish and wrinkles disappear, as on the left above. It might also be used to treat eczema, psoriasis and other skin conditions, researchers say. _____ 8. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised federal money to help rebuild the Canadian city of Fort McMurray, which was nearly destroyed by a wildfire. Damage estimates rise into the billions of dollars. Fires have been ravaging vast swaths of boreal forests in northern latitudes around the world, with climate change often a major factor. _____ 9. Time for a bit of greener news: Researchers are restoring Emily Dickinsonâ€™s beloved gardens at her home in Amherst, Mass. She died 130 years ago today, and her extensive flower and vegetable fields, along with an orchard and greenhouse, were removed by later owners. She once wrote: â€œSome keep the Sabbath going to Church  â€”     I keep it, staying at Home  â€”     With a Bobolink for a Chorister  â€”     And an Orchard, for a Dome. â€ _____ 10. An extraordinary bank heist: For a second time, thieves penetrated the Swift global financial messaging system, apparently targeting a commercial bank in Vietnam. A few months ago, digital robbers got away with $81 million from Bangladeshâ€™s central bank, above. In both cases, the thieves used real network credentials  â€”   suggesting the possibility of insider accomplices  â€”   and hid their actions behind malware. _____ 11. Finally, a sweet note. Japan just loves Kit Kat. There are nearly 300 varieties (including Adzuki Bean and Wasabi) and you can find them in   department stores and    specialty shops. And at least for a few weeks last year, a single stick coated with gold leaf was being sold. Have a great week. _____ Karen Workman contributed reporting.

21410,Your Facebook Page Could Land You In a FEMA Camp,Dave Hodges," 

 

Against my better judgment, I often put my articles on Facebook. Lately, Facebook has been taking down my posts, particularily on topics related to World War III. One of my readers counted 14 sites saw my articles disappear. It is too late for me, but for most of you, you should consider not participating on Facebook. It is one more intelligence gathering tool designed to separate the sheep, from the independent thinkers!
No matter how annoying Facebookâ€™s censors may be, there are real dangers associated with posting and reading on Facebook.
Facebookâ€™s Friends Are Not Nice People 
Facebook is aligned with both the CIA and the NSA. I have several credible sources tell me that all data posted on Facebook goes into series of cataloged files which culminates with each person being assigned a â€œThreat Matrix Scoreâ€. The mere existence of a Threat Matrix Score should send chills up and the collective spines of every American.
When, not if, martial law comes to America, this Threat Matrix Score, of which Facebook data is used to help compile an â€œenemies of the stateâ€ list, your future longevity could be seriously imperiled. It is too late for people like Steve Quayle, Doug and Joe Hagmann, John B. Wells and myself to avoid being placed on this list. However, it is not too late for the average American to limit their exposure by NOT posting and participating on Facebook. Facebook participation should come with a black box warning:
â€œWARNING: The views expressed on Facebook can and will be used against you. Participation in Facebook could prove detrimental to the length of your life. All political dissident views are immediately reported to the CIA and the NSA. Risk of repeated exposure on Facebook could result in you and your family being hauled out of their homes at 3AM, separated from your family and sent to a re-education campâ€. 
Before you dismiss this hypothetical black box warning as too much â€œtongue in cheekâ€, please consider that the NSA is presently extracting large amounts of Facebook data and I do not think they are compiling a Christmas card list.
Facebookâ€™s Welcome Is Wearing Off Many of us in print and broadcast media are rethinking our association with Facebook. Several of our journalistic brothers and sisters have been censored and/or otherwise treated unprofessionally by this entity. Facebook has become replete with trolls who patrol the cyber corridors of this monolithic entity chastising and censoring whoever exposes the liberal, anti-human, depopulation agenda of the New World Order. Whether it is gun control, criticism of NWO puppet Obama or anything that the alleged grandson of David Rockefeller, Mark Zuckerberg, and his people disagree with, they will kick your Facebook account to the curb for daring to express a legitimate political opinion.
 
Facebookâ€™s Zuckerberg, The Self-Perceived Purveyor of Integrity and Morality Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook emphasized three times in a single interview with David Kirkpatrick in his book, The Facebook Effect â€œ You have one identity, and the days of you having a different image for your work friends or co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly. Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity .â€ 
Who appointed Mr. Zuckerberg to be the moral police and the judge of integrity? It sounds like Zuckerberg can take his place with Soros, Gates, Turner, et al., and the rest of the global elite who think they have the right to treat humanity as their own personal property and view the masses as a disposable commodity.
Julian Assange Assessment of Facebook Whistle blower, Julian Assange, once stated that â€œFacebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented. Here we have the worldâ€™s most comprehensive database about people, their relationships, their names, their addresses, their locations and the communications with each other, their relatives, all sitting within the United States, all accessible to US intelligence. Facebook, Google , Yahoo â€“ all these major US organizations have built-in interfaces for US intelligence. Itâ€™s not a matter of serving a subpoena. They have an interface that they have developed for US intelligence to use.â€ 
Never before in American cyber-history do we see such an arrogant and agenda serving entity operating their propaganda so far in the open as we do with Facebook. This propaganda end of the New World Order is being blatantly exposed.
Facebookâ€™s arrogance was on full display when highly respected journalist, Jon Rappoport was banned from sharing his articles on Facebook. In this instance of blatant censorship, Jonâ€™s banned article was merely a review of certain aspects of American presidents ranging from Nixon to Obama. Like so many of us that understand history and can see the tyrannical path that Obama is taking us down, Rappoport identified Obamaâ€™s unconstitutional missteps. And for daring to tell the truth, Facebook banned Rappoport for the mere expression of a legitimate political opinion.
Readers may also recall when members of Infowars.com and the popular talk show host, Michael Rivero were banned in December of 2012, until the public outcry for Facebook to reinstate their respective accounts backed Facebook into a corner from which they acquiesced and reinstated the previously banned media figures.
Rules For Thee but Not For Me Facebook does not apply their holier than thou attitude to their own corporate behavior. As Zuckerberg talks about rectifying Americans lack of integrity through timely Facebook exposure, Facebook fails to pay its own fair share of taxes as a result of tax loopholes and deductions. Facebook paid no income tax for the fiscal year 2012 , despite reaping $1.1 billion in U.S. corporate profits. While Americans have just been subjected to higher taxes, billion-dollar corporations like Facebook, General Electric, Boeing and Wells Fargo have all been able to avoid paying any corporate income taxes, reports the Citizens for Tax Justice .

Reddit Co-Founder Dissociates From Involvement With Facebook In an interview with CNN, Reddit.com co-founder Alex Ohanian explains that he wonâ€™t be investing in Facebook, the largest technology IPO in the history of the Internet.
Facebook founder, Zuckerberg, had stated, at the time that Facebook first made their public offering, that he expected to make billions of dollars. Ohanian further stated that he would not be investing in Facebook in order to enrich Zuckerberg. Ohanianâ€™s reasons for avoiding Facebook as an investment vehicle is tied to the fact that he strongly believes that Facebookâ€™s stance in favor of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, CISPA, is very dangerous to the viability of the internet. In other words, Reddit.comâ€™s founder has clearly stated that Facebook is at the vanguard of Internet censorship.
I applaud Ohanianâ€™s stance as it is clear that Ohanian respects free speech. It is safe to say that Facebook and CISPA are two birds of a feather as they both support blatant censorship regarding political views which differ from their own.
Tax evasion, legal or not, seems to be a trait of Facebook personnel, both past and present. Not only does Facebook not pay taxes while the rest of America is suffering under crushing tax increases, Zuckerbergâ€™s former co-founder, Eduardo Saverin , renounced his U.S. citizenship back in August of 2012 in order to pay less tax. I guess that birds of a feather â€œFacebookâ€ together.
Can it be said that Facebook is a shining example of duplicity and censorship? I think so and I welcome being banned by the monolith because soon Zuckerberg will learn the lesson the phrase â€œpride goeth before the fall.â€ I have long said that Facebook will face some very stiff competition and the millions who have been irritated by the trolls which send warning messages for sending simple personal messages could very well be looking for new jobs.
Technology is fleeting and Facebook could someday go the way of Myspace. I have long advocated that the average citizen needs to avoid the globalist corporate chain stores (e.g. Walmart) and shop locally as much as possible. I think the same could be said about social media sites as well. Why in the world are we posting personal information and our political views on an NSA controlled social media site such as Facebook? To do so, is suicide!
Conclusion 
Although it is too late for me to avoid going on the â€œnaughty listâ€, due to the fact that my work has been published in thousands of venues, I have come to the considered opinion that the average American is placing themselves on the equivalent of the East German Stasi political enemies hit list by posting political views on the NSA-controlled Facebook. My advice to all unpublished Americans is to immediately cease posting on Facebook, which is a direct conduit to being placed on the proverbial â€œRED LISTâ€ and seek out alternatives which are not New World Order friendly.

21412,Bruce Springsteenâ€™s Memoir: Riding Shotgun With the Boss - The New York Times,Dwight Garner,"Long dark highways and thin white lines fire roads and Interstates the skeleton frames of   Chevrolets barefoot girls sitting on the hoods of Dodges pink Cadillacs   power drives men who go out for a ride and never come back. Bruce Springsteenâ€™s song lyrics have injected more drama and mystery into the myths of the American road than any figure since Jack Kerouac. He knows this, of course. So itâ€™s one of the running jokes in his big, loose, rangy and intensely satisfying new memoir, â€œBorn to Runâ€ (what else was he going to call it?) that he didnâ€™t begin to drive until he was well into his 20s  â€”   around the time he landed simultaneously on the covers of Time and Newsweek. His brooding and violent father had been too impatient to teach him and, anyway, he couldnâ€™t afford a car. When Mr. Springsteen was forced to sneak behind the wheel, licenseless, to handle some of the driving on his earliest tours, his ineptitude terrified his band members. He did not exactly, when young and virile, ride through mansions of glory on suicide machines. He mostly stuck out his thumb. Heâ€™d been born to hitch. â€œEvery sort of rube, redneck, responsible citizen and   the Jersey Shore had to offer, I rode with â€™em,â€ he writes in â€œBorn to Run. â€ These rides matter because Mr. Springsteenâ€™s songs, like the   poems of Philip Levine, are intensely peopled. Wild Billy and Crazy Janey, Johnny 99, Mary from â€œThunder Road,â€ Wayne from â€œDarlington County,â€ Jimmy the Saint and Bobby Jean had to come from somewhere. This memoir suggests Mr. Springsteen met many of them while cackling over there in the shotgun seat. The headline news in â€œBorn to Run,â€ to judge by the early news media tweets, is that Mr. Springsteen, who turns 67 on Friday, has suffered periodically from serious depression. I will admit that this information shook me. If Bruce Springsteen has to resort to Klonopin, what hope is there for anyone? But these sections are not the reason to come to â€œBorn to Run. â€ The book is like one of Mr. Springsteenâ€™s shows  â€”   long, ecstatic, exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys. Itâ€™s part sÃ©ance and part keg party, and then the house lights come up and you realize that, A) you look ridiculous dancing to â€œTwist and Shoutâ€ and, B) you will be driving home in a minivan and not a Camaro. His writing voice is much like his speaking voice thereâ€™s a big, raspy laugh on at least every other page. Thereâ€™s some raunch here. This book has not been utterly sanitized for anyoneâ€™s protection, and many of the best lines wonâ€™t be printed in this newspaper. Most important, â€œBorn to Runâ€ is, like his finest songs, closely observed from end to end. His story is intimate and personal, but he has an interest in other people and a gift for sizing them up. Hereâ€™s just one example, chosen nearly at random. When Mr. Springsteen meets a future girlfriend on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, N. J. (one of innumerable girlfriends on display here) he delivers this electric introduction: â€œShe was Italian, funny, a beatific tomboy, with just the hint of a lazy eye, and wore a pair of glasses that made me think of the wonders of the library. â€ Well, hello, you think. Much of the writing in â€œBorn to Runâ€ is this fresh  â€”   the sound of a writer who could have phoned his book in but did not. There are dollops of pretension and   in â€œBorn to Run. â€ Springsteen wouldnâ€™t be Springsteen without homilies, a few of them leaden, about fathers and sons and love and work and community. But this book mostly gets away clean, leaving behind the scent of lightly scorched rubber. Mr. Springsteenâ€™s father was a frequently unemployed bus driver, among other   jobs his mother a legal secretary. They were fairly poor. In their houses  â€”     more often  â€”   there was generally no telephone and little heat. Meals were cooked on a coal stove. â€œBorn to Runâ€ is potent on the subject of social class. In Mr. Springsteenâ€™s part of New Jersey it was the â€œ â€ (preppies) versus the greasers, and there was no doubt which side of that line he was on. At some of his early shows, guys in chinos spat on him. â€œI could still feel the shadow of that spit that hit me long ago when I moved to Rumson in 1983, 16 years later,â€ he writes. Heâ€™d found fame and bought a decent place. Yet: â€œAt 33 years old, I still had to take a big gulp of air before walking through the door of my new home. â€ He suggests thereâ€™s a freight of psychic payback in â€œDarkness on the Edge of Town,â€ his most fully realized album. â€œFor my parentsâ€™ troubled lives I was determined to be the enlightened, compassionate voice of reason and revenge. â€ Mr. Springsteen got his first guitar, a rental, after seeing Elvis on â€œThe Ed Sullivan Show. â€ He had a serious work ethic, and went on to play in a string of   bands with names like Child and Earth and Steel Mill. When his   first record, â€œGreetings From Asbury Park, N. J.,â€ appeared in 1973, he was lumped with the   New Dylans, folk singers like Loudon Wainwright III and John Prine. But there was a crucial difference. Unlike those performers, Mr. Springsteen onstage, thanks to his long   apprenticeship, could blow audiences backward. Mr. Springsteen writes that heâ€™s never thought much of his singing voice. As good a guitar player as he is, others were better. It was his songs, he realized early, that would have to put him over the top. If this book has one curious blind spot, itâ€™s that we never quite understand how those words came into being. He studied the songwriting of people like Mr. Dylan, Donovan and Tim Buckley, he writes. But so did many others. If his early reading was an influence, he doesnâ€™t say. The words were apparently just there, available, on tap. And they stayed there, even when his lyrics became pared down. Songs like â€œThe Riverâ€ and â€œStolen Carâ€ are as evocative in their details as are Raymond Carverâ€™s best short stories. â€œBorn to Runâ€ takes us, album by album, through his career. These chapters sometimes feel clipped and compressed, as if heâ€™s wedged the data in his heart onto a thumb drive. The book takes us through his many stabs at romance, which tended to end badly. (He once gave his father the crabs after theyâ€™d shared a toilet seat.) He details the failure of his first marriage, to the actress Julianne Phillips, and the success of his second, to Patti Scialfa, whom he describes, in a childhood photo, as â€œa   Raggedy Ann of a little girl. â€ He raised his three children without   mementos in the house. â€œMy kids didnâ€™t know â€˜Badlandsâ€™ from matzo ball soup,â€ he writes. â€œWhen I was approached on the street for autographs, Iâ€™d explain to them that in my job I was Barney (the   purple dinosaur) for adults. â€ His eldest son says, in shock, â€œDad, that guy has you tattooed on his arm. â€ Mr. Springsteenâ€™s work ethic has never abandoned him, or he it. â€œIâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve been handsomely paid for my efforts,â€ he writes, â€œbut I truly would have done it for free. â€"
21413,U.S. Breaks With Allies Over Trade Issues Amid Trumpâ€™s â€˜America Firstâ€™ Vows - The New York Times,Jack Ewing,"  Germany  â€”   The United States broke with other large industrial nations over trade on Saturday as the Trump administration rejected concerns among allies about spreading protectionism and made clear that it would seek new approaches to managing global commerce. At a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations and the European Union, Steven Mnuchin, attending his first major international gathering as Treasury secretary, signaled that American policy would follow the campaign promises made by President Trump to put â€œAmerica firstâ€ and review existing trade agreements to seek better deals for the United States. As a result, the ministersâ€™ joint statement, normally a study in blandness, became an unlikely focus of controversy here. The representatives could agree only on a tortured compromise stating, in effect, that trade is a good thing. Adjectives like â€œopenâ€ were dropped, and the ministers omitted language used in previous communiquÃ©s that condemned protectionism, repudiating decades of free trade doctrine. For Asian and European officials, many of them meeting their Trump administration counterparts for the first time, it was a startling lesson in how Mr. Trump and his team are overturning   assumptions about international commerce. Mr. Mnuchin led off the ministersâ€™ meeting on Friday with a declaration that current trade rules were unfair to the United States, positioning the administration against virtually all the other participants, according to an official who attended the closed session and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. â€œWe thought that it was very important for the communiquÃ© to reflect what we discussed here,â€ Mr. Mnuchin said at a news conference on Saturday. â€œThe historical language was not relevant. â€ At the insistence of the United States, the communiquÃ© also dropped a pledge to observe the Paris accords on climate change. Mr. Mnuchin deflected questions on the issue, saying it was outside his purview. The American governmentâ€™s lack of reverence for existing norms and treaties is particularly unsettling to the   Europeans, who are coping with weak economic growth and a surge in populism. The last thing they need is a disruption in commerce with their biggest trading partner. Some complained privately that the American delegation rode into this stately spa and casino town, where Romans once bathed in the   waters, determined to shake up the existing order but without any clear idea of what should replace it. The disagreement over trade principles was a sharp contrast to the statement issued when the central bankers and finance ministers met in Chengdu, China, last July. â€œWe underscore the role of open trade policies,â€ the leaders said in the Chengdu communiquÃ©, which used the word â€œtradeâ€ six times. They promised to â€œresist all forms of protectionism. â€ Less than a year ago, such a statement was not questioned. Business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic still hoped for a trade pact between the United States and the European Union that would eliminate already low tariffs and harmonize regulations governing things like vehicle headlights. Since then, Mr. Trump has pulled out of the   Partnership negotiated by President Barack Obama, vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, and criticized the German carmaker BMW for building a factory in Mexico. The best that the Group of 20 participants could come up with on Saturday was this: â€œWe are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies. â€ Mr. Mnuchin argued that the news mediaâ€™s focus on the language of the communiquÃ© was overblown and said that the discussions in Baden Baden had been congenial. â€œWe were incredibly productive,â€ he said. But he also made it clear that the Trump administration had a vastly different view than its recent predecessors. â€œWe believe in free trade,â€ he said. But he added, â€œWe want to   certain agreements. â€ â€œBalanced trade has to be whatâ€™s good for us and whatâ€™s good for other people,â€ Mr. Mnuchin said. â€œIt has to be a   situation. â€ The communiquÃ©s issued at the end of Group of 20 summit meetings are meant to show that nations like Brazil, China, France and Japan can put aside competing interests and reach consensus, however vague, on major issues. The statements emerge from tortuous deliberations and are the opposite of impulsive. But even the usual boilerplate platitudes proved fraught at this summit meeting. For many European and Asian officials, meeting in a Belle Ã‰poch spa building with polished marble floors and chandeliers dangling from the ceiling, it was their first encounter with the Trump administration and its â€œAmerica firstâ€ foreign policy. Some viewed the meetings as a chance to socialize with the new American representatives and to try to absorb them into the international order. Angel GurrÃ­a, the   of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and a participant in the meetings, said the chance to get to know Mr. Mnuchin was more important than any joint statement. â€œWe want to make him feel comfortable we want to make him feel at home,â€ Mr. GurrÃ­a told reporters. â€œThese meetings are not about the communiquÃ©. â€ In their public statements, European leaders played down the conflicts and said that the discussions had been amiable. The meetings in   came after Mr. Mnuchin visited Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, the German finance minister, in Berlin. â€œNaturally we have different points of view,â€ Mr. SchÃ¤uble said at a news conference on Saturday in  . But he added, â€œWe worked very hard for two days in a pleasant atmosphere. â€ He also denied that the American delegation was at odds with other participants. â€œThe Americans were not isolated,â€ Mr. SchÃ¤uble said. Mr. Trumpâ€™s threats to impose punitive taxes on imported goods are a particular worry for Germany, whose economy is built around exports of automobiles and industrial machinery. The United States is the biggest purchaser of German goods, buying 107 billion euros, or $115 billion, worth last year. Germany imported goods from the United States worth 58 billion euros. The trade imbalance has made Germany a target for Trump administration officials, who have accused Germany of manipulating the value of the euro and have said they want to renegotiate trade terms directly with Berlin, even though that task is done at a European level by Brussels. â€œWe are going to look to our counterparts to continue to trade, but to look to have more balanced trade,â€ Mr. Mnuchin said. â€œThat means over time reducing our trade deficits. I think we can do that in a way thatâ€™s good for the American worker, thatâ€™s good for our companies and thatâ€™s good for our counterparties. â€"
21414,Brazilâ€™s Lower House of Congress Votes for Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff - The New York Times,Andrew Jacobs,"BRASÃLIA  â€”   Brazilian legislators voted on Sunday night to approve impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the nationâ€™s first female president, whose tenure has been buffeted by a dizzying corruption scandal, a shrinking economy and spreading disillusionment. After three days of impassioned debate, the lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, voted to send the case against Ms. Rousseff to the Senate. Its 81 members will vote by a simple majority on whether to hold a trial on charges that the president illegally used money from   banks to conceal a yawning budget deficit in an effort to bolster her   prospects. That vote is expected to take place next month. Those pressing for impeachment had to win the support of   of the 513 deputies in the lower house the decisive 342nd vote for impeachment happened at about 10:10 p. m. Eastern time. The final vote was 367 for impeachment, 137 against and 7 abstaining. Two deputies did not vote. If the Senate accepts the case, Ms. Rousseff will step down temporarily while it deliberates her fate. Vice President Michel Temer, a constitutional law scholar and seasoned politician, will assume the presidency. Given the    margin of deputies voting for impeachment, some political analysts said the Senate was likely to remove Ms. Rousseff from office, a ruling that would require a   majority. â€œPoliticians know how to read society pretty well, and they can sense that the people want her out,â€ said Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. Ms. Rousseff can still appeal to the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Brazilâ€™s highest court, though it has rejected previous motions to have the impeachment measure dismissed. The chamberâ€™s decision to impeach Ms. Rousseff less than halfway through her second term provoked shouts of joy among the thousands of protesters who had gathered in the capital and in cities across the country, but also cries of treachery from her supporters. Weeping as she stood amid the throngs rallying in support of the president, Gabriela Correia, 22, a customer service representative, said she was disgusted that so many deputies, some of them notoriously corrupt, had voted against Ms. Rousseff. â€œI want to make clear that Iâ€™m not here to defend a politician, but to protect our democratic political system,â€ she said. â€œMy heart is aching. â€ Some political analysts said they worried that the move to impeach Ms. Rousseff would cause lasting damage to Brazilâ€™s young democracy,   in 1985 after two decades of military dictatorship. â€œThis is a coup, a traumatic injury to Brazilâ€™s presidential system,â€ said Pedro Arruda, a political analyst at the Pontifical Catholic University in SÃ£o Paulo. â€œThis is just pretext to take down a president who was elected by 54 million people. She doesnâ€™t have foreign bank accounts, and she hasnâ€™t been accused of corruption, unlike those who are trying to impeach her. â€ Although legal experts and political analysts are divided, many have expressed concern over the basis of the impeachment drive. They note that the budgetary sleight of hand that Ms. Rousseff is accused of employing to address the deficit has been used by many elected officials, though not on so large a scale. â€œItâ€™s putting a very large bullet in Brazilian democracy,â€ said Lincoln Secco, a professor of history at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. â€œThis will set a very dangerous precedent for democracy in Brazil, because from now on, any moment that we have a highly unpopular president, there will be pressure to start an impeachment process. â€ The vote to impeach is a crushing defeat for Ms. Rousseff and her Workersâ€™ Party, a former band of leftist agitators who battled the nationâ€™s military rulers in the 1980s and who swept to power in 2002 with the election of one of the groupâ€™s founders, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, to the presidency. Mr. da Silva, a skillful politician who endeared himself to both rich and poor, presided over heady economic growth and a generous expansion of social welfare benefits that helped lift millions of Brazilians out of abject poverty. He also moved to strengthen the governmentâ€™s control of key industries like petroleum. That set the stage for abuses at Petrobras, the   oil company, that would later ensnare scores of the nationâ€™s political and business elite in a scheme that funneled kickbacks into campaign coffers. Barred by the constitution from running for a third term, he anointed Ms. Rouseff as his successor, and she easily won election in 2010. A former Marxist guerrilla, Ms. Rousseff had never before held elected office, and critics say her lack of political skills hampered her ability to work with opposition members in Congress as well as key figures in her governing coalition. In 2014, she was   by a thin margin after an especially divisive campaign. As the economy went into a tailspin and a huge corruption scandal took down   political figures, Ms. Rousseff was abandoned by many of her allies, giving momentum to an impeachment initiative conceived by her rivals. â€œWhen things started going wrong, she was unable to get the situation under control, and her lack of flexibility and stubbornness made things worse,â€ said Mathieu Turgeon, a political scientist at the University of BrasÃ­lia. â€œAll of this has now caught up with her. â€ The impeachment drive has been polarizing, spurring raucous street protests, sundering friendships and provoking widespread anxiety over the potential impact to Brazilâ€™s democracy. Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have likened the impeachment drive to a   coup by her political rivals, among them Mr. Temer, her vice president, who last month joined those calling for her impeachment. The recent fortunes of Brazil, once an economic powerhouse of the developing world, have gone from bad to worse, with the economy expected to contract at least 3. 5 percent for a second year in a row. Millions of Brazilians have lost their jobs since the days of   growth, fueled in part by Chinaâ€™s hunger for commodities. In recent months, her   approval ratings have dipped below 8 percent. â€œThis is a government that has lost legitimacy, credibility and the ability to govern,â€ said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington. â€œItâ€™s a terrible situation. â€ Although Ms. Rousseff is not accused of corruption, the Petrobras scandal has implicated important members of her party, including Mr. da Silva. He is being investigated over allegations that he and his foundation received the equivalent of $7. 8 million in services and lecture fees from construction companies seeking government contracts. The unfolding scandal, known as OperaÃ§Ã£o Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash, has riveted Brazilians, as prosecutors have released details of how Petrobras funneled millions of dollars into the political campaigns of Workersâ€™ Party politicians and their allies. â€œThe impeachment is on relatively weak constitutional grounds, but at the end of the day, this is a vote on the massive corruption probe, deep recession and a series of other issues that have plagued this administration,â€ said Christopher Garman, a Brazil analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm. Ms. Rousseff is the second Brazilian leader to be impeached since 1992, when Fernando Collor de Mello, facing huge protests over an   scandal, resigned moments before the Senate was to vote on his ouster. Ms. Rousseffâ€™s predicament is somewhat different. Unlike Mr. Collor de Mello, she has not been accused of   and despite her sagging popularity, only 61 percent of Brazilians support impeachment, down from 68 percent last month, according to a survey by the polling firm Datafolha. Then there is the question of who and what comes next. Vice President Temer, a senior member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, will have to grapple with political and economic challenges. He also faces possible impeachment over the same allegations lodged against Ms. Rousseff, as well as accusations that he was involved in an illegal   scheme. Next in line for the presidency after Mr. Temer is Eduardo Cunha, the powerful leader of the lower house, who has been a driving force behind Ms. Rousseffâ€™s impeachment. An evangelical Christian who is fond of using his Twitter account to spread biblical verse, Mr. Cunha is accused of using a Swiss bank account to conceal $40 million in bribes. â€œPeople are fed up with the mismanagement and economic mistakes of Dilma, and the corruption and arrogance of the Workersâ€™ Party, but no one feels any optimism for what might come next,â€ said Raul Juste Lores, the editor at large for Folha de S. Paulo, a leading Brazilian newspaper. As tens of thousands of people gathered outside the National Congress on Sunday to express their support for or against impeachment, some celebrated by setting off fireworks, while others said there were no winners in the dayâ€™s vote. Among them was Stephany Machado, 22, a Portuguese teacher who had made the   trip by bus from SÃ£o Paulo. Although she said she was not a supporter of the Workersâ€™ Party, she worries about the   damage that impeachment could inflict on democracy in Brazil. â€œDilma is president through the power of our votes, and what they are trying to do is remove her from power in an anticonstitutional way,â€ she said. â€œWe canâ€™t give this up without a fight. â€"

21418,"A Chicago Shooting Survivor, but in Need of a Miracle - The New York Times",Mitch Smith,"CHICAGO  â€”   In a spacious room on the fourth floor of a rehabilitation hospital, Stacey Turner talked to her only daughter, Precious Land, as if she could understand every word. She styled Ms. Landâ€™s hair, massaged her hands and set out to paint her fingernails. The only sound was the whirring of a ventilator. Then the phone rang, and Ms. Turner became exuberant. After hanging up, she leaned down to kiss her daughterâ€™s face and share the good news. â€œYouâ€™re coming home, baby,â€ she told Ms. Land, who was covered by a blue   blanket that stretched from the tracheotomy tube in her throat to the padded boots on her feet. â€œYou hear that, girl? Youâ€™re coming home. â€ More than three months had passed since Ms. Land had walked, talked or hugged her children  â€”   more than three months since a bullet from an unknown gunman was fired at the car she was driving just a block from her house, severing her spine and interrupting blood flow to her brain. Ms. Land was among 64 people shot in Chicago over Memorial Day weekend, when journalists for The New York Times fanned out across the city to record a steep rise in violence. Six of those victims died, including a teenage girl fatally wounded on Lake Shore Drive and a railroad worker shot dead in a car on a quiet street. The 58 survivors, including Ms. Land, were mostly left to languish in anonymity. Ms. Land was 26, a working mother who the Chicago police said had no criminal record. Doctors do not expect her to recover. And as with most of the shootings in Chicago so far this year, her case remains unsolved. Ms. Turner, 47, had gone that August morning to visit her daughter at the rehab hospital on the cityâ€™s West Side, a trek she made almost every day. But she was thinking ahead. She had ideas, plans. They started with Ms. Land coming home. For weeks, Ms. Land, paralyzed and comatose, had been on the verge of leaving rehab and returning to the brick,   house where she lived with her children and her mother. Once in that setting again, Ms. Turner believed, Ms. Land just might wake up. To prepare for her daughterâ€™s arrival, Ms. Turner converted her own bedroom into a makeshift hospital room with a mechanized bed and a ventilator. There were new linens and artwork purchased at Dollar General. A hall closet was stocked with feeding tube meals, bandages and tracheotomy supplies. But since   one planned moving date after another had slipped by. Each time, there was a reason: The doctor had not signed off the specialized bed had not been delivered Ms. Landâ€™s blood platelet levels were too low. Ms. Turner was disappointed each time, so she instructed the rehab center staff not to call her until everything was finalized, and the only step remaining was to put Ms. Land in the ambulance for the ride home. Finally, she was told, that time had come. An employee from the home health care company arrived at the rehab center to help pack Ms. Landâ€™s equipment into a purple tote bag. But just as the move seemed imminent, the plans began to fall apart. The doctor had not signed off on her departure and was not responding to phone calls. And there was uncertainty about what Ms. Land should be fed. The morning faded into afternoon. Before long, the purple tote bag was unpacked and the equipment placed back on the shelf. Ms. Land was not going home that day. Maybe next week, Ms. Turner was told. â€œSame thing as last time,â€ Ms. Turner said, the smile she wore an hour earlier wiped from her face. â€œThey did it to me again. â€ May 28 was a warm Saturday night midway through the Memorial Day weekend. For many in Chicago, it was a time for barbecues and celebration, the unofficial start of summer in a city known for   music festivals and baseball games. But in the West Garfield Park community, a place of few businesses but many   lots, Memorial Day denoted the start of peak shooting season. More people are murdered in Chicago than in any other American city, the bloodshed overwhelmingly concentrated near West Garfield Park and a handful of other neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. Some expect the city to eclipse 600 murders in 2016, perhaps more than in New York and Los Angeles combined. That May evening, Ms. Land dropped off her children  â€”   Daveon, Tyreanna and Timia Kirkman, and Jimarrion Williams  â€”   a few blocks away to play at the house of a family friend. Then she began the short drive home, steering her car onto West Lexington Street, a   dotted with churches and modest houses. When she was just a block from her doorstep, gunfire sounded. A bullet pierced a tinted side window of Ms. Landâ€™s black Pontiac Grand Prix, slicing through her neck and lodging behind her shoulder. An ambulance rushed to the scene. Police officers and journalists went, too. One television reporter told his viewers that the nameless victim had died. He was wrong. As the evening grew darker, Ms. Turner started to worry. Her daughter should have been home by then. More than an hour passed, and Ms. Turner got a call to pick up Jimarrion, who had grown restless at the friendâ€™s house. On her way to retrieve him, Ms. Turner saw police cars blocking traffic on Lexington and was forced to take a detour. Someone had been shot, she assumed, a sad but ordinary event here. Ms. Turner had already lost a child to Chicagoâ€™s violence. A son, Anthony Jackson, known as â€œPierrie,â€ was shot to death on Nov. 15, 2014. He was 22 years old, and had a son of his own. Mr. Jackson had planned to help his mother clean the house on the day he died. â€œTwenty minutes later, my phone is ringing, people saying Pierrie is dead,â€ Ms. Turner recalled. â€œAnd Iâ€™m like, â€˜He just left out the house. â€™â€ His burial fell on Ms. Turnerâ€™s birthday, which she no longer celebrates. Ms. Turner had long worried about a violent end for her son, who she said was in a gang. But Ms. Land was different, family and friends said. She was a homebody and a hard worker. When she was not at work, she doted on her children and watched â€œGeneral Hospitalâ€ with her mother. She was a bit of a loner, but had an infectious laugh and was never shy about speaking her mind. Born here on the West Side, at the same hospital she was taken to by ambulance after she was shot, she had spent her whole life in Chicago. At 15, she became pregnant. â€œThen she got pregnant again with Tyreanna two years later, then Timia a year later, then Jimarrion a year later,â€ her mother said. She left high school to care for her children, then later enrolled at an alternative school but never graduated. But she managed to stay out of trouble in a neighborhood brimming with crime. Instead, Ms. Land gravitated to work, holding a series of hourly jobs. Early this year, relatives said, she took a job with a company near Oâ€™Hare International Airport, where she helped prepare meals for   flights. She enjoyed the work, rising early for the 4 a. m. shift and picking up extra hours whenever she could. Ms. Land was the family breadwinner, while Ms. Turner, a longtime nursing assistant, stayed home with the children. These days, the loss of a steady pay check weighs heavily on Ms. Turnerâ€™s mind. After the death of Mr. Jackson, Ms. Turner said, Ms. Land â€œtotally changed. â€ â€œShe got paranoid,â€ Ms. Turner went on. â€œShe didnâ€™t like to go outside. She didnâ€™t like to sit out front. She always sat out back. â€ For all Ms. Landâ€™s caution, Ms. Turner questioned her decision last winter to start driving an old Grand Prix. The car was more functional than flashy, and would blend in at any suburban parking lot. But here on the West Side, Ms. Turner said, the black sedan projected an unintentional message that put her daughter at risk. â€œGangbangers, these guys, ride around in these cars,â€ Ms. Turner said. â€œA young woman shouldnâ€™t be in a car like that. â€ On that May night, the Grand Prix sat behind crime scene tape. A few hours elapsed, the sun set, and only one police car was left. Ms. Turner still did not know why her daughter was not home. Then, a woman knocked on her window: Precious had been shot. In a daze, Ms. Turner raced down the block. She saw the bullet hole in the window of her daughterâ€™s Pontiac. She sobbed and rushed to the hospital. There was no prayer circle for Precious Land, no profile of her on the front page of the newspaper, no statements of outrage from City Hall. In three months, a Gofundme page raising money to relocate Ms. Landâ€™s family drew just $200 of its $50, 000 goal in donations. Only one local news outlet identified Ms. Land by name. The truth is this: In a city that averages almost two murders a day  â€”   502 so far this year  â€”   a collective numbness has settled in, and there is rarely much attention left over for the thousands of Chicagoans who survive their gunshot wounds. Ms. Turner worries that it is not just her neighbors and the news media who have forgotten about her daughter, but perhaps also the police. As the weeks passed, Ms. Turner said, she still did not hear anything about the investigation or speak to a detective. She wants to help officers find the gunman. She wants the person who pulled the trigger to go to prison. But she worries that Ms. Land, one of 3, 030 people shot in Chicago this year, has become just another case in an overwhelmed police district where murders have increased about 75 percent this year over 2015. Finally, two months after the shooting, a detective met one of Ms. Landâ€™s relatives by coincidence and called Ms. Turner to say they were working on the case. A police spokesman later told The Times that detectives had left several voice mail messages for Ms. Turner in the weeks after the shooting, but had not heard back from her. Ms. Turner said she received no such messages. At one point, the police also said they had conducted a â€œcomprehensive interviewâ€ with Ms. Land, something doctors say would have been impossible since she has been in a coma. Later, a department spokesman corrected himself and said that there had been no interview of Ms. Land, but that the police had gathered â€œcommunity intelligenceâ€ and were optimistic about solving the case. By early September, Ms. Turner said she had still not seen a detective in person. â€œI guess they see so many shootings and they all think theyâ€™re gang related,â€ Ms. Turner said. â€œI donâ€™t fault them. But you know, at least come see me so yâ€™all can know that my daughter is not this type of person. â€ Ms. Landâ€™s elder son, Daveon, an    swimming enthusiast now in the sixth grade, said his mother was fun but careful she made sure her children avoided the park down the block. When asked why, Daveon said    â€œThey be shooting. â€ Ms. Turner said her grandson struggled to understand how this could have happened to his mother, and now meets regularly with a counselor. â€œHeâ€™s very angry,â€ Ms. Turner said. With the new school year approaching, Daveon paid only his second visit to the rehab center. This time, he stayed in the room instead of darting out in tears. Seeing his mother left him shaken, but Daveon said it only reaffirmed his goal of one day becoming a Chicago police officer. Why that career? â€œThey help people and save people,â€ he said. Ms. Turner is hoping for a miracle. She does not go to church anymore  â€”   she hasnâ€™t for years  â€”   but she believes God is watching her daughter. At Mount Sinai Hospital, Ms. Landâ€™s heart stopped twice that first night. Both times, doctors revived her. Ms. Turner believes there was a reason. But since then there has been one bit of bad news after another. First, Ms. Turner learned about her daughterâ€™s paralysis. Then doctors said that her daughter had suffered irreversible neurological damage from the interrupted blood flow to her brain stem. A few days after the shooting, Ms. Turnerâ€™s phone rang before sunrise, and a nurse told her that her daughterâ€™s heart had stopped again. She asked whether staff members should continue trying to revive Ms. Land. Of course, Ms. Turner responded. â€œI hop out of the bed, didnâ€™t tell anybody, got in the car,â€ Ms. Turner said. â€œThat was at 4 oâ€™clock. I pulled in front of Mount Sinai at 4:06. They said, â€˜We got her back.â€™ They got her heart back, but she wasnâ€™t back. â€ Cases like Ms. Landâ€™s are tragically routine at Mount Sinai and Chicagoâ€™s other trauma hospitals. Gunshot victims arrive almost every day. For patients like Ms. Land, costs can multiply and continue for years so can the toll on loved ones. â€œItâ€™s much easier to go out and tell somebody their family member died than it is to tell them they have â€˜survivedâ€™ but are never going to wake up and are never going to be functional again and are forever going to be in the state theyâ€™re going to see them,â€ said Dr. Gary Merlotti, chairman of Mount Sinaiâ€™s surgery department. â€œAt least thereâ€™s some finality to death, and healing can begin after the grieving process. â€ For weeks, doctors at Mount Sinai treated Ms. Land. But her condition remained largely unchanged, and they saw little hope for her recovery. â€œShe is in, if I can be crass, a   condition: She will die as a result of this injury,â€ Dr. Merlotti said later in an interview. â€œThe death is going to be a result of infections that come from having had a tube in her throat to breathe, from having to have a tube in her bladder to drain urine, from getting bed sores. Eventually, sheâ€™s going to succumb to this injury. â€ But when doctors took Ms. Turner into a meeting room to deliver that news and ask if she wanted to discontinue life support, she was aghast. Death is Godâ€™s decision alone, she said later. â€œOh my God, I went crazy,â€ Ms. Turner said. â€œI mean, I went nuts. Iâ€™m like, â€˜Hell no. I am a fighter. My daughterâ€™s a fighter. And weâ€™re going to fight. Her heart is still beating.â€™ â€œI told them no, and I walked out. â€ Ms. Land spent her 27th birthday in the hospital on June 11, with family at her bedside. After a few weeks, she was moved to RML Specialty Hospital, the rehab center. Ms. Turner began a routine of enduring sweltering heat on dangerous streets to make the   walk to visit. Ms. Turner had kind words to say about the rehab center workers, but she prefers to care for Ms. Land herself. She went to classes on how to care for her daughter at home, though she says it was mostly a review from her career as a nursing assistant. She is determined to get her daughter home. â€œI cry at night,â€ Ms. Turner said during a visit to her daughterâ€™s bedside. â€œNobody knows. I have to keep myself strong for these kids. â€ Keeping them occupied all summer had been a challenge. But finally, for the three youngest children, it was the first full day of school. The morning began at 6 a. m. Ms. Turner, wearing pink fleece pajamas with images of frogs, had arranged each childâ€™s school uniform  â€”   a blue shirt and khaki bottoms  â€”   on a kitchen chair. The girls, Tyreanna, 9, and Timia, 7, emerged from the bathroom first, looking weary but ready. Then Jimarrion, 6, who was starting the first grade, lumbered out of his bedroom. Ms. Turner fixed the girlsâ€™ hair, tying it off with gold ribbons they picked out themselves. Jimarrion struggled to stay awake. The preparations were interrupted when the local television newscast playing in the background shifted to a story about a girl shot on the West Side. The child had been attending a memorial for another shooting victim August would prove to be the cityâ€™s deadliest month in about two decades. â€œAnother    kid got shot at a vigil for a  â€ Ms. Turner said as her grandchildren stared at the TV screen. â€œItâ€™s crazy. â€ Ms. Turner had little time to dwell on it. â€œIâ€™m going to get your shoes,â€ she said as she lined up three new backpacks. Ms. Turner has spent her whole life on the West Side, but she yearns to move to the suburbs, where some of her relatives have escaped the cityâ€™s violence. â€œIâ€™m moving where the white people are at,â€ she said. â€œThereâ€™s no crime. You can go to the store. â€ Staying on Lexington Street has been trying. â€œI cannot stay here,â€ Ms. Turner said. â€œIâ€™m very uncomfortable that my baby got hurt down the street. â€ But finding a   apartment in a safe suburb on her budget is difficult. For the moment, Ms. Turner has little choice but to stay on the West Side. There was a knock on the window, and Tyreanna, Timia and Jimarrion ran out to where a family friend had pulled up in a minivan. Ms. Turner rode the mile with them to their charter school on a quiet residential block. Outside, teachers greeted children and parents by name. Ms. Turner, a decade or two older than most of the other adults, inched through the crowd with her grandchildren, toward the entrance. Back when things were normal, just three months earlier, Ms. Land would be checking up on homework assignments and helping, on the days she was not at work, to manage the morning chaos. â€œUsually, the kids will be yelling,â€ Ms. Turner said. â€œIâ€™ll be screaming and hollering. Precious will be screaming and hollering. â€ Ms. Turner longed to hear that voice again, or to at least have her daughter back home. But for now, all she could do was wait."
21419,US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russiaâ€™s Internet If It Hacks The Election,Alex Ansary,"US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russiaâ€™s Internet If It Hacks The Election 11/08/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
American hackers recently broke into Russiaâ€™s communications networks, electrical grid and government systems in preparation for a retaliatory cyber strike should Russian hackers meddle in the U.S. election, according to NBC News. 
Officials do not expect any major attacks on U.S. infrastructure, which would be tantamount to an act of war, but they are concerned that Russian hackers may meddle in the election by spreading false information. The hacker â€œGuccifer 2.0â€ â€” which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for Russian intelligence â€” claimed they would be monitoring elections â€œfrom inside the system.â€ 
The U.S. preparations are no different than Russia and Chinaâ€™s probing of U.S. networks. The penetration caused no damage to Russia, instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission. Cyber weapons could be deployed if the U.S. suffered a significant attack, but officials tell NBC News that is an unlikely scenario. Just to be sure though, Obama administration officials issued a back-channel warning to Russia to stay out of the election. 
â€œYouâ€™d gain access to a network, youâ€™d establish your presence on the network and then youâ€™re poised to do what you would like to do with the network,â€ Gary Brown, a former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told NBC News. 
U.S. cyber capabilities are top of the line, but the Obama administration has been wary of deploying them, despite consistent Russian provocation. CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency, the agencies responsible for U.S. cyber security, are incredibly secretive regarding U.S. capabilities. Stuxnet is the most well-known, publicized U.S. cyber weapon. The highly advanced computer worm wreaked havoc on Iranâ€™s nuclear enrichment program in 2010. 
CYBERCOM is currently involved in cyber attacks against the Islamic State, but Pentagon officials have been especially silent on the exact details of the â€œ cyber bombs â€ being dropped on the terrorist group. Russia may find itself the next target, should it decide to go from misinformation campaigns to attacks on infrastructure."

Robert Gehl reports that, in her Washington Post article explaining why she and her lady friends decided to drive around the neighborhood and steal Donald Trump signs from private property, thereâ€™s one line that explains perfectly the leftist mentality. 
The liberal idea that your feelings are more important than the law â€“ your personal opinions, or grudges, or perceived injustices grant you permission to commit criminal acts with little regard to the consequences. 
Betta Stothart wrote her article in The Post on Tuesday (she provided a link to her Twitter feed, which was brand new at the time she wrote it, but has already been taken down) confessing to driving around her Falmouth, Maine, neighborhood with two other compatriots stealing dozens of Donald Trump signs from peopleâ€™s yards. 
She was caught and arrested and now has to go to court. She tells us sheâ€™s sorry, but sheâ€™s not. Because her feelings about this campaign are more important. Read how she describes her situation: 
I committed a crime this month, along with two of my friends. Iâ€™m not the lawbreaking type. In fact, as a 52-year-old mom, my life is pretty predictable and boring. But this election, a particular candidateâ€™s boasts about women pushed me over the edge. 
In the suburban, upper-middle-class part of Maine where I live, Republicans and Democrats live together mostly in harmony. In every election cycle, thereâ€™s some tension. But the 2016 presidential campaign has been different. Tensions in my town are running at a fevered pitch. 
Which is how three middle-aged moms came to be running down the road, tearing up the Donald Trump signs along our version of Main Street. Weâ€™d been talking about the infamous Billy Bush tape and the women who have since come forward to share their own stories of abuse. We were angry. Getting Trumpâ€™s name off our median strip seemed like the best way to express our rage. 
These three women must have been proud of themselves, probably laughing heartily as they committed theft, trespassing and violated the First Amendment of their neighbors. Why? Because she thinks she was assaulted by the signs. 
In retrospect, I realize I shouldnâ€™t be proud of my transgression. Hanging out with a bunch of moms, we started grousing about the proliferation of signs. Can you believe someone would put that many Trump signs so close together on our roads? Itâ€™s so rude. Who is this jerk? We felt assaulted by the number of signs . The idea of â€œcleansingâ€ our streets seemed like the fastest way to restore balance and alleviate our election stress â€” at least, that night it did. 
â€œ Assaultedâ€ ? This is exactly why the Left is so dangerous. They are â€œassaultedâ€ by ideas â€“ by mere thoughts or opinions that are not their own. They will do anything- and Ms. Stothart did â€“ to silence any dissent. 
And she writes that â€œ in retrospect, I realize I shouldnâ€™t be proud of my transgression. â€ 
She doesnâ€™t say she isnâ€™t proud, she merely tells us that in retrospect she shouldnâ€™t be proud. 
Which tells us that she is . She is proud of what she did. 
When asked what she would say to the victims of her trespassing and theft, she offers no apology, merely a justification that Trump is bad, and that because she herself was a victim of an unwanted sexual advance, it justifies her behavior. 
She claims sheâ€™ll go to court in December with some sense of humility and shame â€“ sheâ€™ll â€œexplainâ€ and â€œapologize.â€ 
But sheâ€™s not sorry. Not really. 
To her â€“ and the millions of Leftists like her â€“ the ends justify the means. Silence dissent, crush the opposition, tear down and destroy any thing that strays from your worldview. 
This is the world that Ms. Stothart lives in. She still lives in it today. She takes pride in suppressing the political view of her fellow Americans. 
She writes that the â€œagitation and fear is rising on both sides.â€ 
No, Ms. Stothart. I have yet to see a single story about a Trump supporter violating the Constitutional rights of a Hillary Clinton supporter by stealing yard signs. 
This is liberal America. This is Ms. Stothartâ€™s America. 
This is not the America I want to live in."
21421,"Trinh Thi Ngo, Broadcaster Called â€˜Hanoi Hannahâ€™ in Vietnam War, Dies - The New York Times",Mike Ives,"Trinh Thi Ngo, a   radio announcer known as Hanoi Hannah who entertained American forces during the Vietnam War while trying to persuade them that the conflict was immoral, died on Friday in Ho Chi Minh City. She was believed to be 85. Nguyen Ngoc Thuy, a former colleague of Mrs. Ngoâ€™s at Voice of Vietnam, the state broadcaster where she worked for decades, confirmed her death in a telephone interview on Tuesday and said she had been treated for liver ailments. Mrs. Ngo, who broadcast in English, was a propaganda weapon for North Vietnam as it battled the United States and the South Vietnamese government. Her work was in the tradition of Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, whose radio broadcasts were intended to damage the morale of American troops during World War II. Mr. Thuy said that Mrs. Ngo was both a national celebrity and a role model to her younger colleagues, including himself. â€œWe admired her perfect voice and her legendary roleâ€ in the war effort, he said in the interview. Mrs. Ngo was born in Hanoi, the capital, in 1931, when Vietnam was a French colony. (Her exact birth date could not be learned, nor was there information on survivors.) She learned English from private tutors in the early 1950s  â€”   partly, she later recalled, because she loved watching Hollywood films like â€œGone With the Wind. â€ â€œI always preferred American movies to French films,â€ she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1994. â€œThe French talked too much. There was more action in American movies. â€™â€™ Mrs. Ngo began broadcasting for Voice of Vietnam in 1955, a year after Vietnamese revolutionaries defeated France at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, forcing the French from Indochina. Early in her career she used the name Thu Huong, or Autumn Fragrance, because it was easier for her   listeners to pronounce, she told The Times. â€œFewer syllables,â€ she said. Her broadcasts aimed at United States forces began in 1965, and she was still on the air in 1975, when North Vietnam captured Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, and renamed it Ho Chi Minh City. As part of her programs, each 30 minutes long, Mrs. Ngo would announce the names of American soldiers who had died in battle the previous month. Her listeners included the Navy pilot John McCain, the future United States senator, who was a prisoner of war in Hanoi for five and a half years after his plane was shot down in October 1967. On a visit to Hanoi in April 2000, Senator McCain said he had listened to Mrs. Ngoâ€™s broadcasts on loudspeakers that hung from the ceiling in a cellblock illuminated by a single bulb. â€œI heard her every day,â€ he said. â€œSheâ€™s a marvelous entertainer. Iâ€™m surprised she didnâ€™t get to Hollywood. â€ Mrs. Ngoâ€™s broadcasts included music by Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and other antiwar American folk singers, and she took a friendly approach to her listeners, Mr. Thuy said. But beneath her gentle tone, he added, was a steely confidence in the North Vietnamese cause. Nguyen Van Vinh, a Vietnamese cameraman who filmed Mrs. Ngoâ€™s meeting the actress and antiwar activist Jane Fonda in Hanoi in 1972, said Mrs. Ngo had â€œtalked in a whisper to the G. I. s. â€ â€œSoldiers used a gun, but in Hanoi, in North Vietnam, she used her voice,â€ he said. Mrs. Ngo acknowledged as much in the 1994 interview with The Times. â€œMy work was to make the G. I. s understand that it was not right for them to take part in this war,â€ she said. â€œI talk to them about the traditions of the Vietnamese, to resist aggression. I want them to know the truth about this war and to do a little bit to demoralize them so that they will refuse to fight. â€ She said the Americans had called her Hanoi Hannah for a simple reason: alliteration. â€œThe Americans like nicknames,â€ she added."
21422,Donald Trump a KGB Spy?,Alex Ansary,"Donald Trump a KGB Spy? 11/02/2016 In todayâ€™s video, Christopher Greene of AMTV reports Hillary Clinton campaign accusation that Donald Trump is a KGB spy is about as weak and baseless a claim as a Salem witch hunt or McCarthy era trial. Itâ€™s only because Hillary Clinton is losing that she is lobbing conspiracy theory. Citizen Quasar 
The way I see it, one of two things will happen: 
1. Trump will win by a landslide but the election will be stolen via electronic voting, just like I have been predicting for over a decade, and the American People will accept the skewed election results just like they accept the TSA into their crotches. 
2. Somebody will bust a cap in Hillaryâ€™s @$$ killing her and the election will be postponed. Follow AMTV!"
21423,"James Comey Role Recalls Hooverâ€™s F.B.I., Fairly or Not - The New York Times",Scott Shane and Sharon LaFraniere,"WASHINGTON  â€”   Since President Obama named James B. Comey director of the F. B. I. in 2013, the    former prosecutor has spoken often of dark chapters in the bureauâ€™s history, notably J. Edgar Hooverâ€™s order to wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and use the tapes to try to drive the civil rights leader to suicide. â€œThe reason I do those things,â€ Mr. Comey said in a talk at Georgetown University last year, â€œis to ensure that we remember our mistakes and that we learn from them. â€ His point: The nationâ€™s leading law enforcement agency must preserve investigations from any taint of political motive or extralegal influence. So it may be especially painful to Mr. Comey that today, after his second sensational public statement on the F. B. I. â€™s investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s email, some critics and historians are comparing him to Hoover. â€œI think this is sort of a flashback to the days of J. Edgar Hoover,â€ said Sanford J. Ungar, a Georgetown scholar, former journalist and author who has written about the F. B. I. â€™s history. â€œI donâ€™t mean to smear Comey, and it may be an unfair comparison. But Hoover would weigh in on issues without warning or expectation. I just wonder how Comey sees his role. â€ The parallels to Hoover, who ran the F. B. I. and its predecessor from 1924 to 1972 as a fief that reflected his personal and political views, may be quite a stretch. People who know Mr. Comey well dismiss out of hand the notion that he acted to tip the election to either Mrs. Clinton or Donald J. Trump. If he is guilty of anything, they say, it may be a sort of moral hubris, a desire to put his rectitude and incorruptibility on public display. After all, Mr. Comey first came to wide public attention for his role in a 2004 drama at the hospital bedside of John Ashcroft, then the attorney general. Acting in place of the ailing Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Comey had refused to sign off on the reauthorization of National Security Agency surveillance programs that he believed were legally flawed. When he heard two top aides to President George W. Bush planned to have Mr. Ashcroft sign the reauthorization, Mr. Comey sped to the hospital to head them off. It was a rare Washington drama that has often been recounted, usually with Mr. Comey as the heroic agent of justice. But before Mr. Comey, Hoover was the last F. B. I. director to be accused  â€”   at least by some historians  â€”   of trying to influence a presidential election, by feeding useful scraps of information on Harry S. Truman, a Democrat, to the campaign of Thomas E. Dewey, a Republican. To his critics, Mr. Comey has twice flagrantly violated the longstanding norms of law enforcement, politicizing the F. B. I. by injecting it into a   election. His defenders say the controversy may simply show the difficulty of running a law enforcement organization as a purely professional, apolitical endeavor in an election year awash in political passions, suspicions and accusations. (Just ask Loretta E. Lynch, Mr. Comeyâ€™s boss as attorney general, who said after an airport encounter with former President Bill Clinton that drew Republican criticism that she would accept whatever the F. B. I. recommended on the Clinton email inquiry.) Several F. B. I. directors have found themselves tangled in politicized disputes  â€”   Louis J. Freeh, the director from 1993 to 2001, had a contentious relationship with Mr. Clinton. But in the Hoover years, the bureau was a deeply political instrument. Hooverâ€™s personal crusade against communists, real and imagined, his targeting of antiwar and civil rights activists, and his use of F. B. I. files to pressure or blackmail other officials  â€”   sometimes including presidents  â€”   defined the bureau for decades. â€œThe bureau played a very important role behind the scenes in shaping American politics during the Cold War,â€ said Athan G. Theoharis, a professor emeritus at Marquette University and a historian of the F. B. I. â€œWhen you have a secret agency that uses its huge resources to influence politics, thatâ€™s a dangerous thing. â€ The actions that have put Mr. Comey in the spotlight, however unusual, are starkly different from Hooverâ€™s secret maneuverings. Indeed, it may be his determination to be the   transparent and above politics, that has gotten Mr. Comey in hot water, first with Republicans and now with Democrats. Unlike Hooverâ€™s clandestine efforts for Dewey in the 1948 campaign, Mr. Comeyâ€™s actions have been very public and directly related to legitimate F. B. I. business. In July, at a news conference that some former prosecutors now characterize as a mistake, he announced that Mrs. Clinton would not be charged in connection with her use of a private email server, but added that he believed her conduct was â€œextremely careless. â€ On Friday, he announced that agents had found additional emails that might be relevant to the investigation, raising the possibility that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s exoneration had been premature. While Hoover acted to further the fortunes of one candidate, Mr. Comey has been accused, at different times, of seeking to help both sides. Overnight, the F. B. I. director went from being vilified by supporters of Mr. Trump for covering up Mrs. Clintonâ€™s supposed wrongdoing, to coming under attack from backers of Mrs. Clinton for what they said was his improperly handing political ammunition to Mr. Trump. As F. B. I. director, Mr. Comey was faced with a rare phenomenon: a criminal investigation of a leading candidate for president. He responded in July with a rare display of openness about an investigation, saying, â€œI am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. â€ He even testified to Congress in September about the inquiry and was grilled by Republicans. Pressed by Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, Mr. Comey offered a seemingly obvious promise: â€œWe would certainly look at any new and substantial information. â€ Then an unrelated investigation of Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman from New York and the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide, led to an archive of emails that agents thought might be relevant to the Clinton email matter. Mr. Comey, in an email of his own to the F. B. I. work force, made clear that he felt his July statement necessitated another public disclosure. â€œWe donâ€™t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,â€ Mr. Comey wrote. Going public the first time, he suggested, forced him to go public a second time. By Justice Department convention, however, Mr. Comeyâ€™s repeated public statements may have been a mistake. Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law who specializes in legal ethics, said Mr. Comey would have been justified had he simply announced that the Clinton investigation was over. But his first mistake, Mr. Gillers said, was to go further and criticize her sloppy handling of email. â€œIf you decide not to go ahead with a case, you donâ€™t say bad things about a person you have been investigating because there is no forum in which that person can defend themselves,â€ said Mr. Gillers, a Democrat. â€œHe made a terrible, terrible error. â€ With his recent statement, Mr. Gillers said, Mr. Comey again exceeded his authority and â€œgot himself in deeper. â€ He should have said nothing, Mr. Gillers said. Instead, â€œhe injected himself into a political campaign. â€ Michael Chertoff, a Republican who led the Justice Departmentâ€™s criminal division under Mr. Bush but who supports Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Comey violated longstanding department rules and practices in July and again Friday. In doing so, Mr. Chertoff said, he has provided â€œfodder for a lot of unsubstantiated allegations and   accusations. â€"
21424,"Texas Rape Victim Was Jailed for Fear She Would Not Testify, Lawsuit Says - The New York Times",Daniel Victor,"A rape victim who was jailed in Texas for nearly a month because prosecutors feared she would not return to testify after having a mental breakdown on the stand has sued the Harris County district attorneyâ€™s office, county officials and jail employees. The woman, identified as Jane Doe in the lawsuit, was held in the general population at the county jail  â€”   the same place where the rape suspect, Keith Hendricks, was housed. There, the suit says, she was misclassified as the perpetrator of a sexual assault  â€”   not as a victim  â€”   attacked by an inmate, denied medication and punched in the face by a guard. Jane Doeâ€™s treatment amounted to â€œan absolute deprivation of her personal integrity,â€ her lawyer, Sean Buckley, said in an interview Thursday. â€œAs a rape victim, the psychological trauma she experienced was an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and helplessness. â€ â€œAnd if you take out the sexual violation itself and you look at the underlying psychological trauma,â€ he added, â€œthis is exactly what these defendants did to her again while she was still in recovery for her rape. â€ According to the suit filed Monday in United States District Court in Houston, the woman began testifying in December against the man she said had choked, beaten and raped her two years earlier. The woman has bipolar disorder, the suit says, and did not finish her testimony. In what the district attorney later called â€œan extraordinarily difficult and unusual situation,â€ because of concern she would not return to the courtroom, a judge had her locked up until the trial resumed, even though she was not charged with a crime. A spokesman for the Harris County district attorneyâ€™s office declined to comment on Thursday, though prosecutors and the Harris County sheriffâ€™s office have defended their decisions. The decision raises questions about the treatment of people with mental health disorders in the Texas justice system and about the wisdom of jailing someone already victimized and traumatized by a suspect the district attorney called â€œa serial rapist. â€ But the move was not unheard of. In a case in Sacramento, Calif. prosecutors in 2012 demanded that a    victim of sexual assault be held in juvenile detention to ensure that she showed up to testify at the trial of her alleged attacker. She had failed to appear at two previous hearings. But a judge decided about a month later that she could be released and monitored by a GPS device. Advocates for sexual assault survivors said they feared that the Texas case could have a chilling effect on other victimsâ€™ willingness to speak up. The case was originally reported by   a local television station. The woman was sent to St. Josephâ€™s Medical Center for 10 days after she broke down on the stand, the lawyer said. There was no   after she was released from the hospital, and she was handcuffed, arrested and sent to jail on Dec. 18, Mr. Buckley said. During that time, the woman was taken to the courtroom to testify against Mr. Hendricks. He was convicted and sentenced to two life sentences without parole. A judge allowed her to go home on Jan. 14  â€”   27 days after she was jailed. In a video statement that has been uploaded to YouTube, Devon Anderson, the county district attorney, said the rape victim had suffered through a   mental health crisis and had expressed her intention during the trial not to testify again. â€œIf nothing was done to prevent the victim from leaving Harris County in the middle of trial, a serial rapist would have gone free, and her life would have been at risk while homeless on the street,â€ Ms. Anderson says in the video. â€œThis was an extraordinarily difficult and unusual situation. There were no apparent alternatives that would ensure both the victimâ€™s safety and her appearance at trial. â€ Mr. Buckley, the womanâ€™s lawyer, acknowledged that the woman had said she might not testify again. But he said that was â€œwhile she was having a mental breakdown. â€ He said county officials did not have the legal right to detain her since she lived outside Harris County  â€”   in an apartment in Longview, Tex.  â€”   and had not been subpoenaed. Instead of putting the woman in jail, officials should have arranged with a community organization or provided a hotel room with a sheriffâ€™s deputy as a chaperone, Mr. Buckley said. â€œHad they done that, she would have testified, she would have testified well, and she would not have been abused in the jail,â€ he said. The Harris County Sheriffâ€™s Office said the woman was taken to jail after a district judge issued a bench warrant, ordering the sheriffâ€™s office to detain her as a material witness. â€œThe sheriffâ€™s office had no authority but to follow the courtâ€™s order to detain Jane Doe,â€ Ryan Sullivan, a spokesman for the sheriffâ€™s office, said in a statement. Mr. Sullivan said the woman would have been placed in a separate cell had the court ordered that she be kept separate from the general population, but no such order was issued. The lawsuit says that when the woman was processed, she was accidentally classified as having committed a sexual crime, leading to negative treatment from the jailâ€™s medical staff members who didnâ€™t believe her protests. She was in at least two physical confrontations while in jail. On Dec. 23, an inmate pushed her to the ground and repeatedly slammed her head into the concrete floor, according to the lawsuit. On Jan. 8, she suffered â€œan acute psychiatric episode,â€ the lawsuit says. The prison guardsâ€™ response caused her to have a panic attack, during which â€œshe became hysterical and physically uncontrollable,â€ the suit said. At one point, a guard punched her, causing a bruised eye socket, the lawsuit said. She was also charged with felony aggravated assault but that charge was later dropped. The Harris County Jail, one of the nationâ€™s largest, has become known for allegations of deaths, beatings, civil rights abuses, unjust prosecutions and medical neglect, according to a   series in The Houston Chronicle. Jane Doeâ€™s lawsuit, which seeks punitive damages, names the Harris County sheriff, Ron Hickman Taylor Adams, the prison guard Nicholas Socias, an assistant district attorney Harris County and unnamed employees of the jail and the district attorneyâ€™s office. In a statement, Rebecca White, the chief executive of the   Womenâ€™s Center, said, â€œWe appreciate the importance of doing all we can to hold perpetrators accountable, but also believe that respecting the dignity of survivors and providing full support are paramount. â€ Ms. White added that the group was â€œconcerned that sexual assault is already underreported and that this may further deter survivors from coming forward. â€"

The Rock, its â€œSexiest Man Aliveâ€ for 2016, ushering him into an elite group of physically appealing men that over the years has included George Clooney, Matt Damon and David Beckham. The award is, of course, a naked public relations enterprise, bestowed upon a celebrity  â€”   often an actor  â€”   who is in the throes of promoting a new project. In Mr. Johnsonâ€™s case, that would be â€œMoana,â€ an animated Disney film, which will open in wide release on Nov. 23. He will also   in the eighth film of the â€œFast and the Furiousâ€ franchise next year as well as in a remake of â€œJumanji,â€ and he has been chronicling daily the filming process of that film on his Instagram account, which has nearly 70 million followers. Mr. Johnson told the magazine: â€œIâ€™m not quite too sure where we go from here. Iâ€™ve done it all this is it. â€ The magazine has been criticized for nearly always choosing a white man for the cover of this issue. But in Mr. Johnson, the magazine chose its first actor of Samoan heritage. (In interviews, Mr. Johnson has described himself as half black and half Samoan.) Denzel Washington was the first black actor to hold the title. Mr. Johnson, who is 44 and the father of two girls  â€”   Simone, 15, and Jasmine, 11 months  â€”   became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a performer with World Wrestling Entertainment.

He joined the â€œFast and the Furiousâ€ franchise in 2011 for its fifth film. This year, according to Forbes magazine, he became the worldâ€™s   actor. (It may be noteworthy that four of the Top 5 earners  â€”   Mr. Johnson, Mr. Damon, Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp  â€”   have each been Peopleâ€™s Sexiest Man Alive.

(In â€œMoana,â€ he voices the demigod Maui, a character that has been criticized as promoting negative stereotypes of Polynesians as overweight.)

21429,N.F.L. Concussion Settlement Payments Can Begin After Supreme Court Defers - The New York Times,Ken Belson,"The United States Supreme Court on Monday denied a request to review the N. F. L. â€™s settlement with retired players who had accused the league of hiding the dangers of head trauma, paving the way for some players with brain ailments to begin receiving payments of as much as $5 million. The decision ends a contentious   fight between the league and many former players, some of whom are suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other debilitating conditions. The settlement, worth perhaps as much as $1 billion, covers nearly every former player for the next 65 years the leagueâ€™s actuaries estimated that just under 30 percent of them could develop Alzheimerâ€™s or other conditions covered in the settlement. The agreement is by far the largest   settlement, and a landmark in light of the leagueâ€™s repeated denials, made over many years, of the links between repeated head trauma and brain disease. The N. C. A. A. agreed to a far smaller settlement, while the N. H. L. is still fighting its former players, who have filed a suit largely similar to the one brought by the retired N. F. L. players. â€œThis decision means that, finally, retired N. F. L. players will receive   care and support for the serious neurocognitive injuries they are facing,â€ Christopher Seeger, one of the lead lawyers for the retired players, said in a statement. â€œThese courageous men and their families, who in the face of great adversity took on the N. F. L. have made history. â€ The Supreme Court was asked to review the settlement by a subset of retired players who believed, among other things, that the agreement unfairly excluded players who received a diagnosis of a severe brain disease linked to head hits, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, after Judge Anita B. Brody of United States District Court approved the settlement last year. They also argued that the settlement did not adequately account for scientific innovations that may allow for C. T. E. to be diagnosed in people while they are alive. Currently, the disease can be confirmed only in autopsies. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit already rejected those arguments, and the Supreme Court, without comment, followed suit by refusing to review the case. â€œWe are pleased that the Supreme Court has decided not to review the unanimous and   decisions of Judge Brody and the Third Circuit approving the settlement of this litigation,â€ the league said in a statement. â€œWe look forward to working with class counsel and Judge Brody to implement the settlement and provide the important benefits that our retired players and their families have been waiting to receive. â€ Cullin Oâ€™Brien, the lawyer who represented the former N. F. L. player Cookie Gilchrist in the petition to the Supreme Court, had no comment. He and other lawyers representing players who petitioned the court could ask the court to reconsider its refusal, but legal experts said that would be a long shot. Still, the agreement did not come easily. For several years, the N. F. L. insisted that arbitrators, not the courts, should be used to settle disputes between players and the league. The players would likely have had to prove that the concussions they received in the N. F. L. led directly to their current conditions. After Judge Brody questioned whether the initial agreement, worth $765 million, would be enough to cover every player, the league agreed to pay an unlimited amount of damages. Some estimates suggest that the league could pay $1 billion to cover all claims. Critically, the players will not have to prove that they sustained any concussions while playing in the N. F. L. or whether those concussions led to their ailments. The N. F. L. faced with the potentially damaging possibility of players testifying on the stand about their brain injuries and ailments, agreed to settle the case in August 2013. Judge Brody still must rule on the status of more than 100 former players who opted out of the settlement. She also must rule on the $112 million payment that the N. F. L. has agreed to pay the plaintiffsâ€™ lawyers. Starting next month, the league must make six monthly deposits of $20 million into a special account for players covered by the settlement. By April, the plaintiffsâ€™ lawyers must set up the apparatus to allow players to start filing claims. Mr. Seeger said players with diseases that have already been diagnosed should receive checks within weeks after filing their paperwork. Mr. Seeger said he was negotiating with Medicare, which is allowed in   cases of this kind to recoup its medical expenses already spent. As he is negotiating on behalf of a large group of about 20, 000   Mr. Seeger said, he expects Medicare to offer a substantial discount. Those   medical liens would be deducted from any   settlements."

Acid was thrown at the man, in the attack on Copenhagen Street, with the substance then splashing onto a woman then the child, according to The Sun.

21431,The Intercept Outs Neocon Democratâ€™s Smear Against Trump as â€˜Putinâ€™s Puppetâ€™,Eric Zuesse.,"Posted on November 1, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse On November 1st, The Intercept headlined â€œHEREâ€™S THE PROBLEM WITH THE STORY CONNECTING RUSSIA TO DONALD TRUMPâ€™S EMAIL SERVERâ€ , and the reporting team of Sam Biddle, Lee Fang, Micah Lee, and Morgan Marquis-Boire, revealed that: â€œSlateâ€™s Franklin Foer published a story thatâ€™s been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime, an enormous, eyebrow-raising claim that Donald Trump uses a secret server to communicate with Russia. That claim resulted in an explosive night of Twitter confusion and misinformation. The gist of the Slate article is dramatic â€” incredible, even: Cybersecurity researchers found that the Trump Organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with Alfa Bank, Russiaâ€™s largest commercial bank. This is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over, and drool Foer did.â€ The Intercept team concluded their detailed analysis of the evidence by saying: â€œCould it be that Donald Trump used one of his shoddy empireâ€™s spam marketing machines, one with his last name built right into the domain name, to secretly collaborate with a Moscow bank? Sure. At this moment, thereâ€™s literally no way to disprove that. But thereâ€™s also literally no way to prove it, and such a grand claim carries a high burden of proof. Without more evidence it would be safer (and saner) to assume that this is exactly what it looks like: A company that Trump has used since 2007 to outsource his hotel spam is doing exactly that. Otherwise, weâ€™re all making the exact same speculation about the unknown thatâ€™s caused untold millions of voters to believe Hillaryâ€™s deleted emails might have contained Benghazi cover-up PDFs. Given equal evidence for both, go with the less wacky story.â€ However, they failed to dig deeper to explain what could have motivated this smear of Trump: was it just sloppiness on the part of Slate, and of Foer? Hardly â€” it was anything but unintentional: A core part of the Democratic Partyâ€™s campaign for Hillary Clinton consists of her claim that Donald Trump is secretly a Russian agent. This is an updated version of the Republican Joseph R. McCarthyâ€™s campaign to â€œroot communists out of the federal government,â€ and of the John Birch Societyâ€™s accusation even against the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower that, â€œWith regard to â€¦ Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason.â€ Neoconservatives â€” in both Parties â€” are the heirs of the Republican Partyâ€™s hard-right, which now, even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union, hate Russia above all of their other passions. Neoconservatism has emerged as todayâ€™s Republican Partyâ€™s Establishment, and (like with the Democratic Partyâ€™s original neocon, U.S. Senator Henry â€œScoopâ€ Jackson, the â€œSenator from Boeingâ€) theyâ€™ve always viewed Russia to be Americaâ€™s chief enemy, and they have favored the overthrow of any nationâ€™s leader who is friendly toward Russia, such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Viktor Yanukovych, and Bashar al-Assad. Hatred and demonization of Russia is the common core of neoconservatism â€” the post-Cold-War extension of Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Both Slate and especially Foer have long pedigrees as Democratic Party neoconservatives â€” champions of U.S. invasions, otherwise called PR agents (â€˜journalistsâ€™) promoting the products and services that a few giant and exclusive military corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Dyncorp, and the Carlyle Group, offer to the U.S. federal government. Iâ€™ll deal here only with Foer, not with his latest employer (in a string, all of which are neocon Democratic â€˜newsâ€™ media). Foer wrote in The New York Times , on 10 October 2004, against â€˜isolationistâ€™ Republicans, who regretted having supported George W. Bushâ€™s invasion of Iraq, and he headlined about them there, â€œOnce Again, America Firstâ€ , equating non -neoconservative Republicans with, essentially, the pro-fascist isolationists of the 1930s. He concluded that they would come to regret their regret: â€œConservatives could soon find themselves retracing Buckleyâ€™s steps, wrestling all over again with their isolationist instincts.â€ Thatâ€™s how far-right Franklin Foer is: heâ€™s to the right of those Republicans. On 7 June 2004, Foer, in a tediously long, badly written and argued, article in New York Magazine , â€œThe Source of the Troubleâ€ , described the downfall of The New York Timesâ€™s leading stenographer for George W. Bushâ€™s lies to invade Iraq, their reporter Judith Miller. He closed by concluding that â€œthe source of the troubleâ€ was that Miller was simply too earnest and tried too hard â€” not that she was a stenographer to power: â€œPeople like Miller, with her outsize journalistic temperament of ambition, obsession, and competitive fervor, relying on people like Ahmad Chalabi, with his smooth, affable exterior retailing false information for his own motives, for the benefit of people reading a newspaper, trying to get at the truth of whatâ€™s what. â€ (She was anything but â€œtrying to get at the truth of whatâ€™s what.â€ She was the opposite: a mere stenographer to George W. Bush and to the Administrationâ€™s chosen mouthpieces, such as the anti-Saddam exiled Iraqi Ahmad Chalaby.) On 20 December 2004, when the question of whether to bomb Iran was being debated by neoconservatives, Foer, who then was the Editor of the leading Democratic Party neoconservative magazine, The New Republic , headlined in his magazine, â€œIdentity Crisis: Neocon v. Neocon on Iranâ€ , and he introduced a supposed non-neocon from the supposedly non-neocon Brookings Institution, Kenneth Pollack, to comment upon the conflict among ( the other Partyâ€™s ) neocons: â€œIn part, the lack of neocon consensus [on whether to, as John McCain was to so poetically put it, â€˜Bomb, bomb, bomb Iranâ€™ ] can be attributed to the nature of the problem. Nobody â€” not the Council on Foreign Relations, not John Kerryâ€™s brain trust â€” has designed a plausible policy to walk Iran back from the nuclear brink. Or, as Kenneth M. Pollack concludes in his new book, The Persian Puzzle, this is a â€˜problem from Hellâ€™ with no good solution.â€ But, actually, both Pollack and Brookings are Democratic Party neocons themselves; and among the leading proponents of invading Iraq had been not only Pollack but Brookingsâ€™s Michael Oâ€™Hanlon . Brookings had no prominent opponent of invading Iraq. (Brookings has a long history of neoconservatism , and routinely leads the Democratic Partyâ€™s contingent of neocon thinking, even urging a Democratic administration to have its stooge-regimes violate international laws .) The real reason why neocons (being the heirs of the far-right extremistsâ€™ Cold-War demonization of Russia, even after communism is gone) wanted to conquer both Iraq and Iran, was that both countriesâ€™ leaders were friendly towards Russia, and were opposed by the Saud family who own Saudi Arabia, which family quietly worked not only with the U.S. government but with Israelâ€™s government, against both Iraq and Iran, as well as against Syria â€” those three nations (Iraq, Iran, and Syria) all being friendly toward Russia, which both the Saudi aristocracy, and not only the U.S. aristocracy, hate. Itâ€™s not just the conservative â€˜newsâ€™ media that are neoconservative now. The so-called â€˜liberalâ€™ media are so neoconservative that, for example, Salon can condemn Donald Trump for his having condemned Hillary and Obamaâ€™s bombing of Libya. Salon condemned Trumpâ€™s having said â€œWe would be so much better off if Qaddafi were in charge right nowâ€ â€” as if Trump werenâ€™t correct, and as if what happened after our overthrow and killing of Qaddafi werenâ€™t far worse for both Libyans and the world than what now exists in Libya is. (But, of course, for Lockheed Martin etc., it is far better). CBS News and Mother Jones condemned the Trilateralist Joseph Nye for having veered temporarily away from his normal neoconservatism. Then, Nye wrote in the neocon Huffington Post saying that David Corn of Mother Jones and Franklin Foer of The New Republic had misrepresented what he had said, and that he was actually a good neocon after all. Nye closed: â€œIn any case, I have never supported Gaddafi and am on record wishing him gone, and also on record supporting Obamaâ€™s actions in recent weeks. We now know that Gaddafiâ€™s departure is the only change that will work in Libya.â€ Sure, it did. Oh, really? Itâ€™s Trump who is crazy here? More recently, Foer headlined at Slate, â€œPutinâ€™s Puppet: If the Russian president could design a candidate to undermine American interests â€” and advance his own â€” heâ€™d look a lot like Donald Trump.â€ Foer proceeded to present the view of Trump that subsequently became parroted by the Hillary Clinton campaign (that Trump=traitor). Wikipedia has a 450-person â€List of Republicans opposing Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016â€³ , and itâ€™s almost entirely comprised of well-known neoconservatives â€” the farthest-right of all Republicans, the people closest to Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Foer cited many neoconservative sources that are not commonly thought of as Republican, such as Buzzfeed; and he even had the gall to blame the Russian government for having made public its best evidence behind its charge (which was true ) that the overthrow of Ukraineâ€™s democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 was no authentic â€˜democratic revolutionâ€™ such as the U.S. government and its â€˜newsâ€™ media said, but was instead a very bloody U.S. coup dâ€™etat in Ukraine , which was organized from the U.S. Embassy there, starting by no later than 1 March 2013 , a year beforehand. Foer wrote: â€œThe Russians have made an art of publicizing the material they have filched to injure their adversaries. The locus classicus of this method was a recording of a blunt call between State Department official Toria [thatâ€™s actually â€˜Victoriaâ€™] Nuland [a close friend of both Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney] and the American ambassador to Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt. The Russians allegedly planted the recording on YouTube and then tweeted a link to it â€” and from there it became international news. Though they never claimed credit for the leak, few doubted the White Houseâ€™s contention that Russia was the source.â€ To a neoconservative, even defensive measures (such as Russiaâ€™s there exposing the lies that America uses to â€˜justifyâ€™ economic sanctions and other hostile acts against Russia) â€” indeed, anything that Russia does against Americaâ€™s aggressions against Russia, and against Russiaâ€™s allies (such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad, and Viktor Yanukovych) â€” anything that Russia does, is somehow evil and blameworthy. And, of course, Americaâ€™s aggressions are not. The U.S. government and its neocon propagandists are outraged that some people are trying to expose â€” instead of to spread â€” their lies. The American government isnâ€™t yet neocon enough, in the view of such liars."

For contrasts that will make your head spin and your heart ache, compare Trumpâ€™s treatment to the pressâ€™s idolatrous treatment of President Obama.  The mediaâ€™s   attitude toward Obama was unprecedented in the modern era. Not even handsome Jack Kennedy or war hero Eisenhower got the   treatment that Obama got. Obamaâ€™s frequent goofy statements and embarrassing gaffes were either overlooked entirely or treated as amusing sidebars.

21437,Black November,Ilan Pappe," Black November
The Balfour Declaration 99 years ago marked the beginning of a settler colonial project of tragic proportions.
By Ilan Pappe Al Jazeera "" - November is a painful month in the Palestinian calendar. It is dotted with commemorative days that have one theme in common: the partitioning of Palestine.
Today is the 99th anniversary of the Balfour declaration. Although it did not offer partition, it sowed the seeds for it, which eventually allowed the Zionist movement to take over Palestine.
On November 15, we commemorate the Palestinian Declaration of Independence (issued by the Palestinian National Council (PNC)), which was a reluctant national Palestinian consent to partition, notwithstanding the injustice and criminality involved in such an act.
At the end of the month, on the 29th, we commemorate the UN General Assembly Resolution 181, which recommended in 1947 the partition of Palestine into two states.
Put into the right chronological sequence, we can see a direct line between the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the 1947 UN partition resolution and the 1988 PNC's document. It is worth our while to re-read Edward Said's wise words about the Balfour Declaration.
""What is important about the Declaration is, first, that it has long formed the juridical basis of Zionist claims to Palestine, and second, more crucial for our purposes here, that it was a statement whose positional force can only be appreciated when the demographic, or human realities of Palestine are clearly understood. For the Declaration was made (a) by a European power (b) about a non-European territory (c) in a flat disregard of both the presences and the wishes of the native majority resident in that territory, and (d) it took the form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign group, that this foreign group might, quite literally, make this territory a national home for the Jewish people.""
In fact, it was more than that: It allowed a settler colonial movement, appearing very late in history, to envisage a triumphant project even before it set proper foot in the land or had a meaningful geographical and demographic presence there.
'The logic of the elimination of the native' The native population in Palestine was much better equipped than the American Indians or Aborigines to deal with the danger of Zionism when it had just arrived.
They also had far better understanding of self-determination and nationhood than any of the other indigenous people at the time.
In 1917, the Palestinians inhabited their homeland almost exclusively and possessed most of its lands. Only with the help of British bayonets could the settler colonial project of Zionism survive in its early stages through the Palestinian uprisings of 1920, 1921, 1929 and, in particular, 1936.
The British army employed immense force, which included the Royal Air Force, to quell the 1936 Palestinian uprising. It lasted for three years and ended with the British elimination of the Palestinian national leadership, either by killing or by exiling.
This was the main legacy of the Balfour project: not its hallowed text but the policy that ensued in its wake, leading eventually to the catastrophe of 1948.
There were British officials at home and on the ground who had second thoughts and qualms about the alliance with Zionism. They had their say when the British government despatched a Royal Inquiry Commission to examine the origins of the 1936 revolt.
The commission hoped to rectify some of the injustice by suggesting partition between the settlers and the native population.
The Zionist leadership urged the British to transfer the Palestinians from any area that would be accorded to the Zionist settlers, but this was something London refused to do.
However, by legitimising partition in Palestine as a ""solution"" with international credibility, Britain associated this geographical arrangement clearly with the basic impulse of any settler colonial movement, the one so brilliantly defined by the late Patrick Wolfe as ""the logic of the elimination of the native"".
With such a blessing, no wonder that, henceforth, partition and ethnic cleansing in Zionist thought and practice went hand in hand.
When the British cabinet announced its decision to leave Palestine at the beginning of February 1947, and referred the future of the country to the UN, the historical opportunity arose to fuse once more partition with transfer of population.
This time, the Zionist leadership did not seek international legitimacy for the transfer; they sought it only for the partition. It assumed correctly that partition, in particular two years after the Holocaust, would be accepted internationally as a just, moral and reasonable solution.
A European crime The natural Palestinian rejection of the notion of dividing their homeland with settlers, the majority of whom had arrived only few a years earlier, fell on deaf Western ears.
Locating the Jews in Palestine, without the need to come to terms with what Europe did to them in World War II, became the easiest corridor out of Europe's ugliest historical moment.
As is clear today from the documents, the Zionist leadership regarded the partition resolution as both international legitimisation for a Jewish state in Palestine, and the Palestinian rejection of it as a valid pretext for the ethnic cleansing of the native population.
The Arab world supported the Palestinian rejection and hoped at first through diplomatic means to change it. When it became clear during the first of months of 1948 that the ethnic cleansing of Palestine was beginning in earnest (by the beginning of May, most Palestinian towns were depopulated and some wiped out entirely by the Zionist forces), Arab public opinion demanded more from its governments.
The last straw was the Deir Yassin massacre of April 1948. In its wake, the Arab League began to coordinate a large-scale military operation to stop the destruction of Palestine.
Not all the Arab leaders were genuinely interested in this goal, and not one of them was willing to throw into the campaign a meaningful military force.
The result was a total defeat by the Israeli forces, which continued, without any international rebuke or intervention, the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians.
Occupation Two areas remained outside Israel's reach: the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Not because Israel at the time lacked the power to occupy them, but because its leaders decided that the West Bank was a demographic liability and the Gaza Strip could serve as a huge receptor for the hundreds of thousands of refugees Israel pushed out south of Jaffa and Jerusalem.
However, ever since 1948, a lobby had been operating in Israel demanding the occupation of these last bits of Palestine. The opportunity came in 1967.
Soon after it became clear that, at least for some of the Israelis, this was not a welcome development: Occupying the lands of millions of Palestinians proved an unexpected political headache and for a while a financial burden.
Thus the Israeli peace camp was born wishing to control these two areas from the outside and grant them autonomy, and later some members of the movement were even willing to call the areas a state.
At the same time, settlers, with and without government blessing, began to colonise the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
As in 1936, so in 1987, an oppressed people tried to shake off the colonial project. This time there was some positive international reaction which the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was hoping to galvanise for the cause. It seemed that even the US in the post-Cold War era might change its attitude.
Substituting presence with absence American blessing came with a price - a demand that the PLO would acknowledge the partition of Palestine and accept the loss of almost 80 percent of the homeland.
The Declaration of Independence navigated between the pragmatism required and loyalty to the moral and basic principles of the liberation movement. Partition was recognised both as a crime and a fait accompli.
Despite the historical injustice done to the Palestinian Arab people in its displacement and in being deprived of the right to self-determination following the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) of 1947, which partitioned Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish State, that resolution nevertheless continues to set preconditions to international legitimacy that guarantee the Palestinian Arab people the right to sovereignty and national independence.
This might have worked had partition been a genuine strategy or vision of the settler state of Israel. However, conceding demographic exclusivity and total geographical ownership is an unthinkable scenario for any settler colonial project. The aim is to displace the natives and replace them; or, as Edward Said put it so well, substituting presence with absence.
From the Israeli/Zionist perspective, partition can only be a means of completing the project of settler colonialism; it can never be used for limiting or forsaking the project.
Thus, the Declaration of Independence did not affect the reality on the ground, and neither did all the next international, regional or local attempts to resell the idea of partition as a ""two states solution"".
The discourse on partition continued, while the reality of settler colonialism covered now almost every inch of historical Palestine.
November is a good month to ponder why partition, described in American parlance as the best way of keeping neighbours happy, equates occupation, colonisation and ethnic cleansing.
The seeds were sown in 1917, reaped in 1947 and poisoned the country ever since. It is time to adopt a fresh moral and political view on this history for the sake of a better future.

21438,Is the Supreme Court Clueless About Corruption? Ask Jack Abramoff - The New York Times,Carl Hulse,"WASHINGTON  â€”   Take it from a corrupt lobbyist: When it comes to peddling influence and buying politicians, the Supreme Court just doesnâ€™t get it. Jack Abramoff, the former superlobbyist who ended up in prison, said he fears the courtâ€™s unanimous decision to toss out the bribery conviction of Bob McDonnell, the   of Virginia, reflects a regrettable innocence about how things work in the real world. â€œI continue to be concerned by what seems to be a lack of understanding on the part of the justices that a little bit of money can breed corruption,â€ Mr. Abramoff said when I asked him about the McDonnell case. â€œWhen somebody petitioning a public servant for action provides any kind of extra resources  â€”   money or a gift or anything  â€”   that affects the process,â€ Mr. Abramoff said. He should know. Once a man with   Republican connections and easy access to the White House and Capitol leadership suites, Mr. Abramoff and his partners were masters of spreading favors around Washington. They parceled out tickets to major sporting events, escorted influential officials on    golf junkets, paid the tabs for lavish dinners and cozied up to politicians at Signatures, a restaurant Mr. Abramoff once owned on Pennsylvania Avenue. All the while they were soliciting and obtaining help on issues ranging from gambling to wages to tax policy. It all came crashing down ignominiously in January 2006, when Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud and tax offenses, ending his career and landing members of his inner circle behind bars with him. Dealings with Mr. Abramoff also sent Bob Ney, a former Republican representative from Ohio, to the penitentiary and contributed to the downfall of Tom DeLay of Texas, the powerful No. 2 House Republican. Mr. Abramoff, now chastened and repentant, spent nearly four years in prison. Since his release, he has spoken out against the dangers of what he says is an inherently corrupt system where financial aid and other perks are provided to politicians who only naturally take care of benefactors they consider friends. â€œPeople come to think those seeking favors and giving you things are your friends, your buddies,â€ he said, remembering his own days as an insider. â€œHuman nature is such that your natural inclination is, â€˜He has done something for me, what can I do for him?â€™ The minute that has crept into the public service discussion, that is a problem. â€ Such favors were at the heart of the case against Mr. McDonnell. During a period of personal financial turmoil, he received a Rolex, loans, trips, clothing and other benefits from Jonnie R. Williams Sr. a wealthy businessman who was seeking the governorâ€™s help in securing state testing of a dietary supplement. While the governor arranged meetings, made recommendations and appeared with Mr. Williams, the court ruled that he may never have committed an â€œofficial actâ€ on Mr. Williamsâ€™s behalf and that the jury should have received clearer instructions on that point. To many observers, the court essentially said that a politician can be found guilty of corruption only if the government can definitively show an official â€œquoâ€ in response to a benefactorâ€™s â€œquidâ€  â€”   a very high bar in a world of winks and nods. â€œWhen you have a system that defines the line between illegal and legal as it does, there are ways of kind of working through it,â€ Mr. Abramoff said. â€œMaybe 95 percent or 99 percent of what I did wasnâ€™t really illegal. â€ The courtâ€™s decision was quietly celebrated by politicians who believe that prosecutors who are intent on criminalizing ordinary political wheeling and dealing have overreached in a number of cases and needed to be slapped down. They worry that too wide a net could eventually ensnare them and their colleagues. But the ruling was loudly protested by   advocates who worried that the court had thrown open the door to more misdeeds and undermined already flagging public confidence in government. â€œThis is an absolutely terrible message to the public at the worst possible time, when our campaigns are being flooded with huge contributions that are going to buy influence in the future,â€ said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime campaign watchdog and the president of Democracy 21, a group that pushes for government transparency. â€œThe court forgot about the public. â€ The decision was the latest in which the court has seemed to play down, even minimize, the power of money to influence outcomes. The justices did not seem persuaded that donations, trips or expensive meals could make politicians beholden to the giver. After all, the justices themselves take free trips to fancy locales to meet and speak with private groups. In this case, the court seemed to accept Mr. McDonnellâ€™s argument that his efforts on behalf of Mr. Williams amounted to routine constituent work, something he might have done without the watch or the $15, 000 for his daughterâ€™s wedding. During oral arguments in April, some justices seemed worried that politicians were at the mercy of vague rules that could leave them the prey of overzealous prosecutors. â€œFor better or worse, it puts at risk behavior that is common, particularly when the quid is a lunch or a baseball ticket, throughout this country,â€ Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. Mr. Abramoff said the justices seem far removed from the unpleasant realities of his old life. â€œI do think there is a disconnect, and I understand it because none of them have been in the political process,â€ he said of the justices. And that remove may now have diminished both the practice and public perception of politics."

21440,Donald Trump Sweeps 5 States Hillary Clinton Takes 4 - The New York Times,Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin,"Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton barreled toward a general election showdown on Tuesday night as they dominated primaries in Pennsylvania, Maryland and other Eastern states, piling up enough delegates to close in on their partiesâ€™ nominations. Looking past their fading rivals, the two even taunted each other in dueling   events. Mrs. Clinton chided the Republicanâ€™s penchant for harsh language by saying that â€œlove trumps hate. â€ Mr. Trump was more bluntly dismissive of Mrs. Clinton, saying her appeal boiled down to her gender. â€œFrankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I donâ€™t think she would get 5 percent of the vote,â€ Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump had the more convincing performance on Tuesday: He swept all five primaries, winning landslides of more than 30 percentage points over his rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. His routs represented a breakthrough: He received more than half the vote in every state, after months of winning most primaries by only pluralities. The big night for Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton intensified the aura of inevitability around their nomination bids and created urgent new challenges for their rivals. More significant, it increased Mr. Trumpâ€™s chances of avoiding a fight on the floor of the Republican convention in July and of claiming the nomination on the delegatesâ€™ first ballot. â€œWhen the boxer knocks out the other boxer, you donâ€™t have to wait around for a decision,â€ he said boastfully at an   appearance before supporters at Trump Tower in New York. He added: â€œAs far as Iâ€™m concerned, itâ€™s over. â€ Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich fared so poorly on Tuesday that together they were likely to win just 10 of the 118 bound delegates up for grabs. Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware also went for Mr. Trump, who was on track to bring his total to about 950 of the 1, 237 needed to clinch the nomination outright. Mr. Cruz is now under growing pressure to beat Mr. Trump in Indianaâ€™s primary next week, perhaps the last real chance the   forces have to halt his march to the nomination. He and Mr. Kasich forged an alliance to thwart Mr. Trump in Indiana, but it has yet to show signs of working. Even before polls closed in the East on Tuesday night, Mr. Cruz tried to   the rush of coverage about Mr. Trumpâ€™s dominance. â€œTonight this campaign moves back to more favorable terrain,â€ Mr. Cruz told supporters in the Knightstown, Ind. gymnasium where the high school basketball movie â€œHoosiers,â€ about underdogs who triumph over a   rival, was filmed. On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders won only the primary in Rhode Island and fell further behind Mrs. Clinton in their race to amass 2, 383 Democratic delegates to clinch the nomination. Clinton advisers predicted late Tuesday night that she was poised to net roughly 50 more pledged delegates than Mr. Sanders, out of 462 up for grabs, adding to her lead of about 240 going into the primaries. Clinton advisers said Tuesdayâ€™s final delegate tally would reveal not if, but when, Mrs. Clinton would win the nomination: either in early June, if she continues at her current pace, or as soon as the Kentucky and Oregon primaries on May 17, if she does better than expected in the coming weeks, once her support from more than 500 superdelegates is included. Superdelegates could switch their votes at any point, but Mrs. Clintonâ€™s are widely considered to be staunch supporters. Mrs. Clinton predicted that she would return to Philadelphia this summer for the Democratic convention â€œwith the most votes and the most pledged delegates. â€ She pledged to heal the partyâ€™s wounds after a long nomination fight, telling Sanders supporters that â€œthere is much more that unites us than divides us. â€ But she also looked past Mr. Sanders to take a swipe at Mr. Trump and his campaign motto, â€œMake America Great Again. â€ â€œDespite what other candidates say, we believe in the goodness of our people and the greatness of our nation,â€ Mrs. Clinton said. Mr. Sanders, speaking Tuesday night to an audience of 6, 500 people in West Virginia, which votes May 10, said emphatically that he would stay in the race. He made an unusually pointed appeal to superdelegates, arguing that he had won more votes from independents and from Republicans than Mrs. Clinton and would be a stronger general election candidate. After the rally, however, Mr. Sanders issued a statement saying he would go to the Democratic convention in July â€œwith as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platformâ€  â€”   a remark that some Democrats interpreted as his first acknowledgment that he would not attend the convention as the nominee. Still, for all his fortitude, Mr. Sanders plans to reassess his candidacy on Wednesday and decide whether to adjust his strategy if Mrs. Clintonâ€™s delegate lead appears all but insurmountable. His senior strategist, Tad Devine, said the Sanders team would discuss a range of issues including how to adjust messaging about the nominating process and what route if any there is to winning it. Mr. Devine said he could still see a mathematical path to securing the nomination but added that, if it changed, the campaign would have to adjust. â€œIf we are sitting here and thereâ€™s no sort of mathematical way to do it, we will be up front about that,â€ Mr. Devine said Tuesday. The broad support for Mr. Trump spanned some of the dividing lines that have characterized the Republican race until now: He won among the affluent and   as well as with   voters and those with no more than a high school education, according to exit polls. But the unease about Mr. Trumpâ€™s candidacy in some quarters of the party persisted, a potential warning sign if he emerges as the nominee. About a quarter of Republican primary voters in Connecticut, Maryland and Pennsylvania said they would not support him if he were the partyâ€™s nominee. The resistance to Mr. Trump was greatest among Mr. Kasichâ€™s supporters, who are more  : Six in 10 said they would not vote for Mr. Trump in November. Mrs. Clinton was lifted once again by strong backing from blacks and older voters, but she also ran stronger with white voters than she has in many states. In Pennsylvania, she narrowly won among whites. Her performance was even better in Maryland, where she carried white voters by 12 points. Mr. Trumpâ€™s advantage across all five states was so forbidding that Mr. Cruz abandoned the Northeast entirely on Saturday, and Mr. Kasich was left to pick up stray delegates. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders campaigned aggressively in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, but they focused largely on policy issues like fracking, gun control and Wall Street reform rather than sniping at each other as they did in a raucous televised debate in Brooklyn. Not only did Mr. Trump have significant prospects for a substantial delegate haul Tuesday, a week after his dominating performance in New York, he also had the opportunity to send a clear message to party leaders and other Republicans that resistance to his nomination is futile. Mr. Trumpâ€™s path toward a delegate majority becomes far clearer if Mr. Cruz is unable to defeat him in Indiana. That is why Mr. Cruz left Pennsylvania on Saturday to head to Indiana, and he plans to campaign there as aggressively as he has anywhere since the Iowa caucuses, where he scored a surprise victory. The stakes for Mr. Cruz are so high that within political circles, speculation has been swirling this week that he would try to change the subject from his latest losses and announce his pick for vice president before the primary in Indiana. Advisers to Mr. Cruz were cagey about whether he would take such an extraordinary step in an effort to win Indiana, where polls last week put Mr. Trump ahead. But the advisers did not dismiss the possibility, an indication that they were thinking about such a move, wanted to keep the speculation alive, or both. But Mr. Trump has no intention of giving Mr. Cruz the opening in Indiana he so plainly needs. He planned a rally Wednesday night in Indianapolis with a beloved figure in the state who has also been known to speak his mind and find controversy: Bobby Knight, the former Indiana University menâ€™s basketball coach. The two Democrats have also been eyeing Indiana, with Mrs. Clinton campaigning there on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton narrowly beat Barack Obama in the Indiana primary in 2008, winning support from a sizable majority of white voters  â€”   who made up nearly 80 percent of the electorate in that primary  â€”   while Mr. Obama won about 90 percent of the black vote. In the 2016 primaries and caucuses, Mr. Sanders has often beaten Mrs. Clinton among white voters, especially white men, and he also performs well with independents, young people and college students, all of whom were expected to be forces in Indiana. â€œWhile our area has lost a lot of   manufacturing jobs, and Senator Sanders has a way of tapping into that, I think Democrats are ready to rally around Mrs. Clinton and help her get ready to take on Trump and the Republicans,â€ said Dennis Tyler, a Clinton backer who is mayor of Muncie, Ind. in a county Mrs. Clinton carried eight years ago. Sanders advisers have been steadily optimistic about Indiana, but they also acknowledged that a victory there would not matter much if Mr. Sanders fell even further behind Mrs. Clinton in the race for delegates. â€œIf we do,â€ said Mr. Devine, the senatorâ€™s strategist, â€œwe may have to go back to the drawing board. â€"
21441,Comment on Brother of Clintonâ€™s Campaign Chair is an Active Foreign Agent on the Saudi Arabian Payroll by marlene,marlene,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Claire Bernish 
Tony Podesta â€” brother of the now-disgraced Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta , whose files Wikileaks has been publishing â€” is not only a powerful Democratic Party lobbyist, but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of Saudi Arabia. 
No â€” as tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist as it might sound â€” that scenario is the absolute truth. 
In 1988, John and Tony Podesta formed the Podesta Group and have used their bigwig party-insider status to lobby and influence government policies â€” while, at various times, simultaneously holding positions of power â€” which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest. 
According to the March 2016 filing made in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, Tony Podesta is an active foreign agent of the Saudi government with the â€œ Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court ,â€ and acts as an officer of the Saudi Arabia account. 
At this point, the web of pay-for-play between the Washington, political heavyweights, and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight. 
For starters, the Podesta brothersâ€™ lobbying firm receives $140,000 every month from the Saudi government, which, in no uncertain terms â€” and despite a status as privileged U.S. ally â€” wages a bloody campaign of censorship, murder, suppression, human rights abuse, and worse against its civilian population, while bombing hospitals, schools, and aid convoys in neighboring nations. 
John Podesta previously served as President Bill Clintonâ€™s chief of staff, founded the think tank Center for American Progress (which oh-so-coincidentally touts the need to reframe Saudi Arabiaâ€™s hopelessly tarnished image), counseled President Obama, and now chairs Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign. 
Tony Podesta acts as a foreign agent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia â€” lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the Kingdom â€” while also contributing to and bundling for Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign. 
Think about that for a moment. 
One brother uses the influence of money to both affect United States foreign policy and infuse the Clinton campaign with cash â€” while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities. 
As the Washington Post reported months ago in July, Tony Podestaâ€™s lobbying efforts â€œraised $268,000 for the campaign and $31,000 for the victory fund.â€ 
â€œThe Saudis hired the Podesta Group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in Yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home, including sentencing blogger Raif Badawi to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for â€˜insulting Islam,â€™â€ Alternet reported . â€œSince then, Tony Podestaâ€™s fingerprints have been all over Saudi Arabiaâ€™s advocacy efforts in Washington DC. When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions, The New York Times noted that the Podesta Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution.â€ 
Notably, the Saudisâ€™ reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up â€” concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year, but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict. 
Additionally, Tony Podestaâ€™s status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15, 2015 â€” ironically revealed by Wikileaksâ€™ publishing of his brothers personal communiques â€” in which former Clinton Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders: 
â€œHi all â€“ we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] are already donating and raising. 
â€œI do want to push back a bit (itâ€™s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties)â€¦ and how do we explain to people that weâ€™ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now wonâ€™t. Either way, we need to make a decision soon.â€ 
To which general counsel to the Clinton campaign, attorney Marc Elias, replied [all errors original and emphasis added], 
â€œResponding to all on this. I was not on the call this morning, but I lean away from a bright line rule here. It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta, Canada canâ€™t give, but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can. Just as we vet lobbyists case by case, I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied, it would not be a flat our ban. A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Obama.â€ 
As the exchange continues, how to precisely handle the campaignâ€™s image with potentially controversial donors â€” while, at all costs, maintaining the flow of cash â€” becomes even more apparent. As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds, 
â€œWhere do we draw the line though?â€ 
Elias suggests a particularly intricate solution: 
â€œIf we do it case by case, then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money, we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States, its relationship to the State Department during Hillaryâ€™s time as Secretary, and its relationship, if any, to the Foundation. In judging the individual, we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillaryâ€™s past campaigns specifically. 
â€œPut simply, we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists, except with a somewhat more stringent screen. 
â€œAs a legal matter, I am not saying we have to do this â€“ we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. Iâ€™m just offering this up as a middle ground.â€ 
Mook eventually decides plainly, 
â€œMarc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions donâ€™t really get you anythingâ€¦that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. Soâ€¦in a complete U-turn, Iâ€™m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?â€ 
All of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect â€” despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime â€” the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015. 
Tony Podestaâ€™s specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, which will earn $1.68 million by yearâ€™s end, does, indeed, suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine. 
â€œSaudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington,â€ Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post . â€œThat spans both what youâ€™d call the inside game, which is lobbying and government relations, and the outside game, which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying.â€ 
That broader audience â€” the American public â€” has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis, as well. 
As The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported , the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable â€” including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign. 
Although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet. And yet, at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House â€” who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts. 
The system isnâ€™t rigged â€” itâ€™s performing exactly as intended â€” and always will as long as the vote validates its existence. Don't forget to follow the D.C.

21442,Obamacare Architect Asked How to 'Fix' the Program. His Answer Reinforces Critics' Worst Fears.,Jason Howerton,"Share on Twitter 
With premiums set to spike dramatically in 2017, MIT economist and so-called Obamacare â€œarchitectâ€ Jonathan Gruber shared his big idea to fix the struggling health care law during an interview on CNN Wednesday. 
â€œOnce again, thereâ€™s no sense in which this has to be fixed. The law is working as designed, however it could work better,â€ Gruber said. â€œI think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty.â€ 
So Gruberâ€™s idea is to make it more expensive for people choosing to incur the â€œmandate penaltyâ€ in order to nudge them to enroll in Obamacare and take on higher premiums. The theory is that as more people enroll, the associated costs will go down. 
You might remember Gruber from a 2014 video in which he bragged about the Obama administration was able to take advantage of the â€œstupidity of the American voterâ€ to get Obamacare passed. 
â€œLack of transparency is a huge political advantage,â€ he said in the video. â€œCall it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get anything to pass.â€ 
On several occasions, Gruber has been captured on video talking about exploiting American voters â€œlack of economic understanding.â€ 
The Obama administration admitted on Monday that Obamacare premiums for mid-level benchmark plans will increase by 25 percent on average across the country. Further, 20 percent of consumers will also have just one insurer to select from. 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has vowed to â€œrepeal and replaceâ€ Obamacare with a new plan to provide â€great health care at a fraction of the cost.â€ He has offered few details on what that plan would entail. 
Hillary Clinton has promised to build on Obamacare and enact fixes rather than trashing the entire program. "
21443,How Correct Breathing Can Prevent Cancer and Depression?,Maia M,"Keywords: Body Detox , breath , breathing exercises , Breathing Techniques 
Breathing â€“ a process that goes almost unnoticed and happens on such a deep subconscious level, yet it is vital for our being. Nowadays, there are more and more cases of people breathing incorrectly. 
Living in a big city surrounded by constant stress, pollution and technology can sometimes bring the body out of sync with the natureâ€™s flow. Young children know how to breathe correctly on an intuitive level. Their body follows the rhythm of nature. 
With time, as the stress increases and obstacles come into our lives we quickly forget our calm manner of breathing and switch to a frantic one instead, without even realizing it. Cancer Prevention 
In 1931, Dr. Otto Warburg received a Nobel Prize when he proved that cancer cells are anaerobic . This means that they cannot survive in high levels of oxygen. When a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar. A normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen, whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation. Cardiovascular Health 
Hypertension is all too common, quite often as a result of stress. In order to lower the blood pressure, itâ€™s important to decrease the stress levels . One of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep, slow breathing. Not only does it calm your heart beat, but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace. 
Research was conducted over a 30 year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan , as well as increase general health. The Framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity, meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath, and the lifespan of that person. An increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan. Cure for Depression 
Brain needs oxygen to work, just like any other organ in the body. Stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result. One of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke. This is an extreme example, but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression. Long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing, can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions. Symptoms such brain fog, forgetfulness, lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected. Increased Energy Levels 
Have you ever told someone youâ€™re tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise? This is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration . When you inhale the air correctly, more of it gets to your body, thus increasing the energy levels through conversion. It is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles. Different Breathing Techniques 
There is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits. Breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure, improve sleep, help with anxiety and much more. 
Yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called Pranayama as an essential part of the process. Coming from the East, itâ€™s uncertain when exactly yoga originated, but there is evidence that it has been around for at least 5,000 years . Yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years, making them timeproof. I will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that I personally use in different situations. Best Body Detoxifier 
Kapalbhati is a breathing technique that detoxifies your body, opens up your nasal passages and allows your mind to concentrate. After doing the exercise you will feel a rush of energy that will immediately wake you up. 
Instructions: Sit comfortably with a straight spine. Place your left hand on the knee with the palm facing upwards and your right hand on the stomach. Take a deep breath. Quickly exhale. While exhaling, pull the stomach in as if youâ€™re trying to touch the back and do it to an extent that feels comfortable. However, do not apply strength or pressure beyond the level of comfort. 20 repetitions per set. Come back to normal breathing after each set and observe your bodyâ€™s sensations. Itâ€™s advised to do 100-200 repetitions daily. Sleeping and Stress Reducing Technique 
Itâ€™s a simple slow breathing 4-7-8 exercise that helps you fall asleep faster or calm down during an anxiety attack. All you have to do is: Fully exhale through your mouth with a sound whoosh With a closed mouth, slowly inhale with your nose on a count of four Hold your breath for seven seconds Exhale fully through your mouth on a count of eight , making a whoosh sound Repeat until you feel sleepy or calm"
21444,â€˜The BFGâ€™ Stumbles as â€˜Finding Doryâ€™ Rules Box Office - The New York Times,Brooks Barnes,"LOS ANGELES  â€”   Hollywoodâ€™s   summer lineup continued to falter over the weekend, at least in North America, as two movies carrying a combined $500 million in production and global marketing costs arrived to $57. 7 million in total ticket sales. â€œThe BFG,â€ directed by Steven Spielberg and released by Walt Disney Studios, was envisioned as a return to family form for the director  â€”   marketing materials reminded consumers that he made â€œE.

Faring better was â€œThe Legend of Tarzan. â€ Starring Alexander Skarsgard as the   and made by Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow, â€œTarzanâ€ collected roughly $38. 1 million over the   period. That total was much higher than analysts predicted before release. Most critics turned up their noses, but audiences gave the film an   in CinemaScore exit polls, suggesting positive word of mouth. Even so, â€œTarzanâ€ remains squarely in the loser column when it comes to profitability. Loaded with visual effects  â€”   violent apes, stampeding wildebeests  â€”   the movie cost a   $180 million to make, not counting marketing. â€œThis property has always really been about the international opportunity,â€ Jeff Goldstein, Warnerâ€™s executive vice president of domestic distribution, said by phone on Sunday. â€œYou can best assess it a month from now. â€ Directed by David Yates and   Margot Robbie, â€œTarzanâ€ opened in limited overseas release over the weekend, taking in $18. 8 million. Important markets like Britain and China are still to come. While acknowledging a â€œfrustratingâ€ result for â€œThe BFGâ€ at home, David Hollis, Disneyâ€™s distribution chief, also pointed to international audiences as a potential salvation for the movie, which is based on a book by Roald Dahl. â€œWeâ€™re really proud of the film,â€ Mr. Hollis said. â€œWeâ€™re going to be reliant in a lot of ways on international. â€ So far, â€œThe BFGâ€ has opened in only two overseas markets, Russia and Australia. With â€œThe BFGâ€ collapsing in North America and â€œTarzanâ€ not exactly sizzling, the No. 1 movie on Hollywoodâ€™s home turf over the July Fourth weekend was again â€œFinding Dory. â€ That sequel, from Disneyâ€™s Pixar division, took in an estimated $41. 9 million for a   domestic total of $372. 3 million. â€œTarzanâ€ was second. Third place went to â€œThe Purge: Election Yearâ€ (Universal) a horror sequel that cost only $10 million to make and roughly $20 million to market. It sold a strong $30. 9 million in tickets. Blumhouse Productions, the   company behind the â€œPurgeâ€ series, has successfully kept this franchise going by pursuing different storytelling styles. The previous installment had action underpinnings this one added a political dimension. The summer box office always has ups and downs, but the current season has been much bumpier than usual. Disney has found two monster hits (â€œFinding Doryâ€ and â€œCaptain America: Civil Warâ€) but has also suffered two major flops (â€œThe BFGâ€ and â€œAlice Through the Looking Glassâ€). Other   movies that have received a disappointing response from domestic audiences include â€œIndependence Day: Resurgence,â€ â€œTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadowsâ€ and â€œWarcraft. â€ An   on sequels has been one reason for Hollywoodâ€™s rough ride. But analysts have cautioned about overgeneralizing at the seasonâ€™s midway point. Several movies ahead could still salvage the summer box office, including â€œThe Secret Life of Pets,â€ â€œGhostbustersâ€ and â€œSuicide Squad. â€"
21445,BUSTED: ABC News Staged Fake Crime Scene,Dikran Arakelian (noreply@blogger.com),"Share on Facebook ABC News has been caught staging a fake â€œcrime sceneâ€ for reporter Linsey Davis to report from in a segment broadcast on Good Morning America. Viewers were presented with the sight of Davis standing in front of yellow police tape with the words â€œSHERIFF'S LINE DO NOT CROSSâ€ and ABC News, reporting from the site for hours, claimed Davis was in the middle of an active crime scene. But she wasn't. The ABC News report had more in common with a Hollywood production than a breaking news report. Linsey Davis was actually standing in a field in Woodruffe, South Carolina â€“ not at the crime scene she was claiming to be reporting from. Sources with knowledge of the matter say the sheriff's tape was placed there by the ABC News crew for the purpose of its inclusion in the live shot. A photo leaked by an anonymous source shows the sheriff's tape running no more than 30 yards â€“ and tied at both ends to ABC News camera stands. Busted â€“ and ABC know it. â€œThis action is completely unacceptable and fails to meet the standards of ABC News,â€ said Julie Townsend, the vice president of communications at ABC News. â€œAs soon as it was brought to our attention, we decided to take the producer out of the field, and we're investigating further.â€ Fake Sheriff's Tape, Fake News But ABC News' recent behavior gets even worse. While they are spending money and resources on faking crime scenes to set their viewers' pulses racing, they have also been exposed misleading their audience about real news. After ignoring the bombshell news that the FBI has been conducting an active investigation into the Clinton Foundation for more than a year, Good Morning America on Friday finally realized they couldn't continue ignoring the story without losing credibility. So they covered the story. But only for 40 seconds and only to dismiss it as â€œinaccurate and â€œunsubstantiated.â€ CBS This Morning's Major Garrett followed up by chiding â€œunconfirmed speculation.â€ On Good Morning America, correspondent Tom Llamas continued the misleading angle. â€œWith just four days to go, Trump in full attack mode against Hillary Clinton, sending his crowds into a frenzy with these unsubstantiated reports ABC News sources say are inaccurate.â€ How can anybody trust these exposed liars anymore? Deceit and manipulation are fundamental to mainstream media operations these days. Sources: Cable News Network , Mashable Related:"
21447,Hong Kong Elected 2 Separatists. China Took Drastic Action. - The New York Times,Michael Forsythe,"HONG KONG  â€”   In the nearly two decades since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule, the Communist government in Beijing has tolerated all manner of activity in the city that it generally finds intolerable on the mainland: annual vigils for those killed in the Tiananmen Square massacre, newspapers publishing scurrilous gossip about Chinaâ€™s leaders, huge demonstrations for free elections. But by deciding to intervene in a local court case and essentially blocking two politicians from taking seats in Hong Kongâ€™s legislature, China signaled more clearly than ever on Monday that there was a limit to its tolerance in this former British colony, which was promised a â€œhigh degree of autonomyâ€ in an international treaty. The two young activists who are testing that limit are advocates of independence for Hong Kong. While being sworn in, they made a statement of defiance against Chinese rule, using a crude obscenity and a term that many consider a slur against Chinese people. In acting against them, the government of President Xi Jinping has asserted new authority to set policy in Hong Kong, opening what could be a more chaotic era here, in which elected officials are held to a vague standard of political loyalty and blacklisted if they fall short. The Communist Partyâ€™s intervention in Hong Kongâ€™s independent legal system could also damage the territoryâ€™s reputation as an international trade and finance hub in Asia. Many multinational corporations, banks and law firms are based here because of the dependability and fairness of the cityâ€™s courts. Businesses also find Hong Kong appealing because of its political stability, but thousands of people demonstrated and clashed with the police on Sunday night in anticipation of Beijingâ€™s action, which could incite more street protests. Chinaâ€™s move came in the form of a rare interpretation of the Basic Law, the charter that governs Hong Kong and that was negotiated with Britain before the territoryâ€™s return to Chinese rule in 1997. The charter gives Chinaâ€™s Parliament the right to interpret the Basic Law, and the Communist leadership has done so four other times since the handover. Mondayâ€™s ruling breaks new ground because it is the first time that Beijing has acted in a pending court case without a request by the Hong Kong government or judiciary, and because it appears to establish a mechanism for the authorities to block critics of Communist rule from taking elected office or even getting their names on ballots. Some scholars said the decision went beyond interpreting the charter and amounted to rewriting the local statute governing how officials are to be sworn in. It requires lawmakers to read their oaths â€œcompletely and solemnly,â€ exactly as written, and orders those who administer oaths to disqualify lawmakers who alter or deliver the words in an â€œinsincere or undignified manner,â€ barring them from office without another chance to be sworn in. The decision also says lawmakers will be held liable if they violate their oaths, but it provides no guidance on who has the power to determine whether a lawmaker is in breach or what the punishment should be. The fear is that this will inject a degree of arbitrariness into a system that is based on rules underpinned by centuries of precedent under British common law. â€œWhether it would affect my seat is secondary,â€ Nathan Law, 23, a new member of the Legislative Council who advocates greater   for Hong Kong, said of the ruling by Beijing. â€œWhatâ€™s most important is that the interpretation is vesting so much power in a person to decide whether someone is sincere and allegiant enough to take office, and there is no    against that person. â€ The Basic Law says little about oaths, only that officials must swear allegiance â€œin accordance with lawâ€ to the â€œHong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. â€ Two politicians elected to the legislature in September, Sixtus Leung, 30, known as Baggio, and Yau   25, set off the legal case by changing the wording of their oaths, replacing the word China with â€œâ€ a term that many find offensive and that was used by Japan during World War II, when it occupied much of China, including Hong Kong. Ms. Yau also inserted an obscenity. The Chinese government condemned the pair and labeled them threats to national security for their advocacy of independence, and officials in Beijing left little doubt in announcing Mondayâ€™s decision that it was intended to keep them out of office. Li Fei, the chairman of Chinaâ€™s parliamentary committee on the Basic Law, compared Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau, and their supporters, to traitors espousing a â€œfascistâ€ line. â€œThere is a great patriotic tradition in the Chinese nation,â€ he said. â€œAll traitors and those who sell out their countries will come to no good end. â€ He added that the governmentâ€™s stance â€œwill not be ambiguous or lenient. â€ The United States, on the eve of its own presidential election, urged China not to undermine the â€œone country, two systemsâ€ formula that has protected basic civil liberties in Hong Kong. The United States believes â€œan open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and governed by the rule of law is essential for Hong Kongâ€™s continued stability and prosperity as a special administrative region of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China,â€ the State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, said on Monday. Hong Kongâ€™s politicians reacted along predictable lines, with the   establishment endorsing the decision and the   opposition criticizing it as an infringement on   in the territory. The unpopular chief executive, Leung   vowed to fully enforce the decision, saying, â€œThis is about the countryâ€™s unity and sovereignty. â€ Michael Tien, a   lawmaker in Hong Kong who endorsed the ruling, said it could be used to screen future candidates running for office and to challenge those who have already taken seats in the   Legislative Council, including several opposition lawmakers who have made statements in favor of   or independence for Hong Kong. â€œThis thing is expansive,â€ Mr. Tien said in a telephone interview, adding that Beijingâ€™s allies in Hong Kong could ask courts to rule on whether these lawmakers were sincere in swearing allegiance or had violated their oaths. Such a process is likely to be contentious, said Simon Young, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, because the language of Beijingâ€™s decision is short on specifics. It says nothing about whether advocating   or independence violates an officeholderâ€™s oath, for example, or how to handle candidates who change their position on the issue. As a result, politicians such as Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau could seek to win back their seats by renouncing support for independence and going back to court. And that could lead Beijing to intervene further and issue new decisions to stamp out people it wants to disqualify. â€œThis will possibly be the first of a possible series of interpretations,â€ Mr. Young said. In the meantime, he added, â€œthe courts in Hong Kong will have to interpret the interpretation. â€ The Chinese governmentâ€™s overarching goal is to crush a small but growing independence movement in Hong Kong, which gained momentum after Beijing rejected calls for free elections in the territory during the enormous   demonstrations of 2014. But by intervening in the legal case over Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau, Mr. Xi has drawn more attention to their cause, and he risks provoking a backlash that could strengthen it. In a scene that resembled the 2014 demonstrations, the police used pepper spray early Monday to battle crowds of protesters who had gathered around the Chinese governmentâ€™s liaison office in Hong Kong, some of whom were shouting, â€œHong Kong independence. â€"
21448,"Why ice ages occur every 100,000 years",nan,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 03:20 UTC From CARDIFF UNIVERSITY Why does our planet experience an ice age every 100,000 years? Deep storage of carbon dioxide in the oceans may have triggered this unexplained phenomena, new research shows. Â© Lisieki and Raymo LR04 Î´18O from Lisieki and Raymo (2005) correlated to the temperature anomaly inferred from the deuterium concentration in ice cores from EPICA Dome C, Antarctica (Jouzel et al., 2007). The main orbital (purple), tectonic (brown) and oceanic (blue) events are indicated (see the text for the references of each event). The orange box represents the start of the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciations. 100 kyrs and 40 kyrs correspond to the orbitally-driven glacial/interglacial cycles period. This period changed from 41 kyrs to 100 kyrs during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition toward 1 Ma (MPT). click to enlarge Experts from Cardiff University have offered up an explanation as to why our planet began to move in and out of ice ages every 100,000 years. This mysterious phenomena, dubbed the '100,000 year problem', has been occurring for the past million years or so and leads to vast ice sheets covering North America, Europe and Asia. Up until now, scientists have been unable to explain why this happens. Our planet's ice ages used to occur at intervals of every 40,000 years, which made sense to scientists as the Earth's seasons vary in a predictable way, with colder summers occurring at these intervals. However there was a point, about a million years ago, called the 'Mid-Pleistocene Transition', in which the ice age intervals changed from every 40,000 years to every 100,000 years. New research published today in the journal Geology has suggested the oceans may be responsible for this change, specifically in the way that they suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere. By studying the chemical make-up of tiny fossils on the ocean floor, the team discovered that there was more CO2 stored in the deep ocean during the ice age periods at regular intervals every 100,000 years. This suggests that extra carbon dioxide was being pulled from the atmosphere and into the oceans at this time, subsequently lowering the temperature on Earth and enabling vast ice sheets to engulf the Northern Hemisphere. Lead author of the research Professor Carrie Lear, from the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, said: ""We can think of the oceans as inhaling and exhaling carbon dioxide, so when the ice sheets are larger, the oceans have inhaled carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making the planet colder. When the ice sheets are small, the oceans have exhaled carbon dioxide, so there is more in the atmosphere which makes the planet warmer. ""By looking at the fossils of tiny creatures on the ocean floor, we showed that when ice sheets were advancing and retreating every 100,000 years the oceans were inhaling more carbon dioxide in the cold periods, suggesting that there was less left in the atmosphere."" Marine algae play a key role in removing CO2 from the atmosphere as it is an essential ingredient of photosynthesis. CO2 is put back into the atmosphere when deep ocean water rises to the surface through a process called upwelling, but when a vast amount of sea ice is present this prevents the CO2 from being exhaled, which could make the ice sheets bigger and prolong the ice age. ""If we think of the oceans inhaling and exhaling carbon dioxide, the presence of vast amounts of ice is like a giant gobstopper. It's like a lid on the surface of the ocean,"" Prof Lear continued. The Earth's climate is currently in a warm spell between glacial periods. The last ice age ended about 11,000 years ago. Since then, temperatures and sea levels have risen, and ice caps have retreated back to the poles. In addition to these natural cycles, manmade carbon emissions are also having an effect by warming the climate."

21450,Scientists Told To â€˜Remain Silentâ€™ On Glyphosate Cancer Findings,Starkman,"The World Health Organization (WHO) have told scientists to stay silent on documents relating to the cancer-causing dangers associated with glyphosate. 
Via YourNewsWire 
In a letter, officials from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) warned scientists against disclosing information from a 2015 study that suggests that Monsantoâ€™s weedkiller Roundup is carcinogenic.
The WHOâ€™s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) distributed a report in early 2015 calling the weed killer â€œprobably carcinogenic.â€ Makers of the product say the claim is false, citing their own research into the product.
Since then, several groups using Freedom of Information Laws have asked for documents related to how the IARC decision was made, including scientists on the panel that live and work in the U.S. at U.S. institutions. In response, the WHO said those documents pertaining to glyphosate research are private and its own property.
Reuters reports some parties are considering a lawsuit seeking to clarify whether thatâ€™s the case and if itâ€™s subject to U.S. FOIA laws. Glyphosate is the key ingredient of Roundup, which is sold by Monsanto.

21451,Michael Moore Owes Me $4.99,shorty,"Where to Invade Next Official Trailer 1 (2016) â€“ Michael Moore Documentary HD M ichael Moore has made some terrific movies in the past, and Where to Invade Next may be the best of them, but I expected Trumpland to be (1) about Trump, (2) funny, (3) honest, (4) at least relatively free of jokes glorifying mass murder. I was wrong on all counts and would like my $4.99 back, Michael. Mooreâ€™s new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton is â€” except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and heâ€™s dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. This film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the â€œElect her and then hold her accountableâ€ stuff. He says we have a responsibility to â€œsupport herâ€ and â€œget behind her,â€ and that if after two years â€” yes, TWO YEARS â€” she hasnâ€™t lived up to a platform heâ€™s fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). Moore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars youâ€™ve put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon which Hillary Clinton reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictions â€” the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. Standing before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that â€œcozinessâ€ consists of, and he claims that sheâ€™s more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. What? It wasnâ€™t one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. Itâ€™s all the other wars before and since. *She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. *She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. *She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. *She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. *She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. *She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. *She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. *She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. *She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. *She is eager to antagonize Russia. *She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. *She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. *She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. *She supported President Bill Clintonâ€™s wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. *She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a â€œNo Flyâ€ zone. *She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. Thatâ€™s just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? Moore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. â€œI hope she did,â€ screams Moore. â€œThatâ€™s who I want as Commander in Chief!â€ Hee hee hee. Then Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least â€œuniversalâ€ healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clintonâ€™s focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that itâ€™s the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didnâ€™t create â€œuniversalâ€ healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. Moore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clintonâ€™s progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. Mostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates â€œthat glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass.â€ Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Mooreâ€™s inclusive comments throughout his performance: â€œWeâ€™re all Americans, right?â€ Mooreâ€™s fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the government â€” executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). But when he runs for president, Moore says, heâ€™ll give everybody free drugs. Iâ€™ll tell you the Clinton ad Iâ€™d like to see. Sheâ€™s standing over a stove holding an egg. â€œThis is your brain,â€ she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. â€œThis is your brain on partisanship.â€ NOTE: ALL IMAGE CAPTIONS, PULL QUOTES AND COMMENTARY BY THE EDITORS, NOT THE AUTHORS PLEASE COMMENT AND DEBATE DIRECTLY ON OUR FACEBOOK GROUP CLICK HERE ABOUT THE AUTHOR David Swanson wants you to declare peace at http://WorldBeyondWar.org His new book is War No More: The Case for Abolition .

21452,Rare â€™Pink Starâ€™ Diamond Becomes Priciest Diamond Ever Sold at $71.2M - Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,"A 59. 6 carat pink diamond broke the world record for the priciest diamond ever sold. [The diamond, known as the â€œPink Star,â€ sold for $71. 2 million at Sothebyâ€™s auction house in Hong Kong, the Associated Press reported.  The oval, mixed cut diamond surpassed Sothebyâ€™s   estimate of $60 million. The gem was sold for $83 million at another Sothebyâ€™s auction in Geneva, but the buyer defaulted and the purchase never went through. The jewel is the largest pink diamond ever graded by the Gemological Institute of America. â€œWeâ€™re very happy,â€ said Sothebyâ€™s Asia Chairwoman Patti Wong. Wong identified the winning bidder as Hong Kong jewelry firm Chow Tai Fook. The companyâ€™s chairman, Henry Cheng   placed the winning bid over the phone, CNN Money reported. Wong said the company is not worried about a default this time because the auction house vetted the bidders, who also just so happen to have longstanding relationships with Sothebyâ€™s. The last gem to hold the record of most expensive jewel ever sold was the â€œOppenheimer Blue,â€ which sold for $57. 5 million at Christieâ€™s auction house in Geneva in May 2016, NBC News reported."
21453,"Mom Has Powerful Response for Haters Who Say Disabled Toddler is â€œLess Attractiveâ€ Now That Sheâ€™s â€œGained Weight""",Prudence Hill,"Share on Twitter 
Sonia Morales didn't hesitate for a moment when she was told that her unborn daughter would be born with a severe birth defect. While doctors suggested she terminate the pregnancy, Sonia knew she had been given a gift. 
And when online strangers make hateful comments about her daughter now, Sonia has the perfect response. Loading Facebook Post... 
As WJLA News reports, Sonia was 16 weeks pregnant when she learned that her child had anencephaly. Her daughter would be born without a portion of her brain, skull, and scalp. 
Doctors predicted that the baby would survive a few hours or days, but Sonia refused to consider abortion. She tells WJLA: 
â€œGod made no mistake giving Angela to Rony, Elizabeth, and I. He chose us for this sacred task and we said yes to his calling. We made the commitment even before her birth. We will take care of her the rest of her life here on earth.â€ 
Sonia and her family welcomed baby Angela on March 23, 2014. Sonia began working to raise awareness about anencephaly, creating a Facebook page about her daughter and her â€œmiraculous journey.â€ Loading Facebook Post... 
With the internet being what it is, however, it was only a matter of time before the horrible remarks came trickling in. 
Quite a few commenters wrote about how they thought Angela was less than human. Some even suggested that Sonia would be doing her daughter a favor if she ended Angela's life. 
Sonia says that the hateful messages bring tears to her eyes, but that she tries to move past them. However, one comment in particular drove her to respond. She recounts on Facebook what one poster wrote: 
â€œAngela looks less attractive now that she is growing and gaining weight.â€ 
Sonia decided to reply for the daughter who could not. After pointing out that beauty lies within, she writes: 
â€œI know that Angela looks different from my typical child, but she is beautiful just the way she is. ... She is full of grace and has great peace despite the struggles. She is a radiant light in the darkness in this materialistic and shallow culture that defines beauty in the pleasure of interests. She is a true picture of strength; she is a precious little girl with a beautiful soul. So this statement does not define whom Angela IS, it defines who YOU really are!â€ 
In response to those who hold her daughter's life cheap, Sonia only says that they can't know what it's like to enjoy her daughter's smiles and laughter. She tells WJLA: 
""Even if her life does not please some people, we canâ€™t play God and assume the right to dictate who should live and die. If you get to spend five minutes with her, you will see that she is perfect the way she is.â€ 
Now two years old, Angela has defied expectations, and her family says that they are blessed to have her with them for as long as they can. Loading Facebook Post... 
After seeing how her daughter has been an inspiration to so many, Sonia knows exactly how meaningless the harsh words from strangers are. She tells NBC10 News : 
â€œIt is so amazing to see how many lives Angela has touched around the world. She hasn't said a word, but her testimony of life and love has reached more than 50 countries. God chose Angela before she was even born. She might never walk or talk or go to school or run a marathon, but she has done more than I have ever done in my entire life.â€ 
And despite the negative comments, Sonia knows that she gets to spend her days with a miracle. "
21454,Jeff Sessions: Justice Dept. Under Trump Has â€™Zero Tolerance for Gang Violenceâ€™ - Breitbart,Ian Mason,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with leaders from across federal law enforcement Tuesday to address transnational organized crime. [â€œLet me state this clearly. Under President Trump, the Justice Department has ZERO tolerance for gang violence,â€ Sessions told the press in a prepared statement before the meeting of the Attorney Generalâ€™s Organized Crime Council. The group, which has met since 1970, is made up of representatives from the many federal agencies and   task forces that address organized crime in America.  Sessions touted President Donald Trumpâ€™s February executive order on criminal gangs as leading the way for efforts to dismantle the international criminal organizations responsible for a large amount of the violence, drug trafficking, and human exploitation in this country. â€œToday, weâ€™ll be proposing concrete ideas to follow through on President Trumpâ€™s directive,â€ he said. The Attorney General singled out the particularly brutal gang Mara Salvatrucha, commonly known as â€œ â€ for his attention:   has become a symbol of this plague that has spread across our country and into our communities. There are over 30, 000 members abroad with their headquarters in the El Salvadoran prison system. According to the National Gang Intelligence Center,   now has more than 10, 000 members in at least 40 states in this country â€”  up significantly from just a few years ago.   originated among Salvadorans in Los Angeles, California, many of whom fled to this country in the 1980s to escape El Salvadorâ€™s horrific civil war and the   death squads operating throughout Central America at the time. Today,   is made up of tens of thousands of members, primarily Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and their descendants in the United States. Operating without any regard for national borders, the gang has brought the kind of atrocities once confined to Central Americaâ€™s political conflicts with it wherever it has spread. Recently,   has been linked to a string gruesome murders across the United States. Last Wednesday, the bodies of four men and boys aged   were found in suburban Long Island, New York. The victims were tortured and mutilated to the point their tattoos had to used to identify them. Two additional bodies were discovered last in Fairfax, Virginia, only a few dozen miles from the Capital Dome, too badly disfigured to be identified. Details in each case led authorities to suspect the involvement of   whose members have faced justice for countless similarly brutal crimes.   operates under the motto â€œkill, rape, control,â€ according to a DOJ fact sheet on the group. Justice officials believe that when   crews in the United States are not aggressive or ruthless enough, their leaders in El Salvadorâ€™s prisons warn them to keep to â€œLa Programmaâ€  â€”   The Program  â€”   understood to mean stepping up the violence and brutality in their allotted territory to increase the gangâ€™s power and territory. Sessions compared the group to the Mafia and the Colombian cartels, two once imposing criminal groups brought low by federal law enforcement in the past. Attorney General Sessions linked the transnational gang problem to immigration issues: Because of an open border and years of lax immigration enforcement,   has been sending both recruiters and members to regenerate gangs that previously had been decimated, and smuggling members across the border as unaccompanied minors. Sessions has made enforcement of our immigration laws a centerpiece of his tenure at Justice. He has stated that gang members will be among those illegal aliens who will be a top priority for deportation. Many of   and other gangsâ€™ members are illegals, and efforts are being stepped up to remove them from the country. On Saturday, the Attorney General confirmed to Fox Newsâ€™s Judge Jeanine Pirro that gang affiliation alone will be enough to qualify illegal aliens for priority removal. Sessions specifically hit upon   â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ for the role they play, according to him, in providing harbor to members of   and other gangs. â€œSanctuary cities are aiding these cartels to refill their ranks and putting innocent life  â€”   including the lives of countless   immigrants  â€”   in danger,â€ he said. Sessionsâ€™ DOJ is looking into methods to compel these jurisdictions to comply with federal immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities. Some sanctuary city leaders, however, are resisting these efforts. Answering questions from the press after his address, Sessions acknowledged the need to move quickly to confirm his new Justice Department team, including all 94 United States Attorneys. The Attorney General has previously expressed dismay at the slow pace of confirmations in the new administration. Tuesday he said he hoped to have all these important positions filled with competent prosecutors."
21455,Aoun has been appointed the President of Lebanon â€“ Again.,Muhammed Ali Carter,"By Muhammed Ali Carter on November 2, 2016 Lebanon's future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of Iran. Lebanese celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of Batroun after election of former general Michel Aoun as president 
The news didnâ€™t come as much of a surprise in the end. Presidential posters with Michel Aounâ€™s face were already being hung around east Beirut before the results had even been released but now itâ€™s official, Lebanon has finally elected a new president! Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian and former military chief, was elected on Monday making him the countryâ€™s 17th president, ending a two-year political vacuum in the countryâ€™s top post that had left Lebanon paralysed. Aoun now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by poverty, joblessness, a massive refugee overload with refugees from various countries, practically non-existent public services, constant threat of war from their southern neighbour Israel, and bomb attacks from Salafi terrorists. 
Interestingly enough, this is the second time that Aoun has been announced the President (according to himself) when he and the Christian-led military government of East Beirut appointed itself in 1988 and anyone who dared disputed this was met with violence, which did eventually occur. Aoun even went on to fight a â€˜war of liberationâ€™ against the Syrian Arab army forces stationed in Lebanon during 1990 [i] which ended in failure and forced Aoun to flee his native land into exile in France. [ii] 
The man behind the poster 
Aoun is considered, by his supporters, to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals. On the other hand, most Lebanese I have spoken to about Aoun have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who I assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy. Corrupt, untrustworthy, an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to Lebanon after his 15-year exile. 
I have to admit, the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of President Aoun sitting in the big chair of the Baabda presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face. The last time Aoun held the Baabda palace, the Syrian army under the authority of Michel Aoun, pictured at the presidential palace in Baabdaafter being elected President of Lebanon. 
President Hafez Al-Assad of Syria, bombed him out in a US-backed attempt to illuminate a stubborn Lebanese nationalist troublemaker. Yet now, twenty-six years later, Bashar Al-Assad (the son of Hafez) offered his personal congratulations to Aoun on his election victory. [iii] Just maybe, President Aoun also shares my dark humour, which would explain his sly self-satisfied smirk while he sat in his long-awaited prize seat. Despite all the odds, he has returned to Lebanon and claimed what he had always wanted, the presidency. 
Aoun carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of conflict, civil war and side switching which has left many in Lebanon questioning if this old-school lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested â€“ Lebanon would be better off remaining politically frozen â€“ instead of appointing a man who has fought against the Assad administration in Lebanon during the late 80â€™s but now fully backs Assad and Hezbollah in Syria. This is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in Lebanese politics, however, the fact remains that Lebanon has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink. 
I personally agree with the Progressive Socialist Party and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said on Twitter prior to the vote that itâ€™s time to elect â€˜anyâ€™ president to escape the presidential vacuum. [iv] 
Why elect Aoun now? 
I have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the Lebanese coast [v] but Lebanonâ€™s political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling Lebanese gas. 
Israel & Egypt also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the Mediterranean. [vi] Perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of Aoun have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back Hezbollahâ€™s ally for president; Hariri who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to Aounâ€™s candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans. Given Haririâ€™s recent bad luck with his struggling business in Saudi Arabia, I wouldnâ€™t put it past him. [vii] 
Imagine, Saad Hariri, who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where Hezbollah hitmen who Michel Aoun (L) at news conference, beside Lebanonâ€™s former prime minister Saad al-Hariri, after Hariri announced that he will back Aoun to become president 
assassinated his father, Rafic Hariri, is now willing to throw his vote to Hezbollahâ€™s candidate in order to secure the position (also for the second time) as prime minister. 

Certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a rollercoaster two-year timeline leading up to yesterdayâ€™s grand finale but I suspect that Lebanonâ€™s political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker which, now, is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never ending, decades-old sectarian feuds. 
What Could Aoun Bring? 
During my last trip to Lebanon, I was shocked to see how even the average middle-class Lebanese struggle with the lack of basic services. The country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the Lebanese army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical Salafi terrorists [viii] , the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money & equipment. 
Aoun, the one-time proxy of Saddam Hussein [ix] (the Iraqi dictator who fought a long bloody war against Iran) is now considered the candidate who confirms an Iranian political victory over its competitor for political influence in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia. 
What has largely held the country back is the fact that Lebanon has been stuck in a vicious game of tug-of-war between Saudi & Iran. Lebanonâ€™s refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future. Saudi has cancelled a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic excuse, blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by Lebanonâ€™s foreign minister (who happens to be Aounâ€™s son-in-law) Gebran Bassil who refused to accept a Saudi-proposed statement referring to Hezbollah as a terrorist group. [x] The Saudi produced statement Left, Lebanon FM Gebran Bassil. Centre Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rai. Right, Michel Aoun President of Lebanon. 
also demanded all Arab league members to condemn Iran which both Lebanon & Iraq refused to do. 
However, in previous attempts to remain neutral, Lebanon has also refused to accept any Iranian or Russian offers to provide free arms deliveries to the Lebanese army in order not to upset the countries ties to the US or the Gulf. Now that Aoun holds office, Lebanon may have the guts to finally accept Iranâ€™s offers of arms and economic support to better supply its security forces and enhance Lebanese ability to protect itself and boost its frail economy. 
I have to give Aoun credit, In his first speech after becoming president, he pledged to fight corruption and protect Lebanon from the fires raging around it, referring to the Syrian civil war. Aoun was also talking tough against Israel according to Hezbollahâ€™s Al Manar-TV with promises to liberate contested territory which Aoun labelled an â€œIsraeli occupation,â€ referring to Israeli-occupied parts of the Golan Heights. Iran too has been quick to hail Aoun with congratulations. Ali Akbar Velayati a veteran MP of the Islamic Republic, described the choice as a victory for Iran and its allies in Lebanon because the Lebanese president is â€œa very significant ring in the chain of the Islamic resistance,â€. [xi] 
Aoun has been willing to publicly side with Iranâ€™s ally Hezbollah and his son-in-law foreign minister Bassil refused to condemn Iran politically while under pressure to do so from most of the Arab league, so it seems fair to expect that Aounâ€™s Lebanon would be willing to build bridges between Beirut and Tehran, despite the offence this would cause to the Gulf. 
Whether you like Aoun or not all that really matters at such a desperate stage is whether he has what it takes to do a good job or not. Yes, he is old and has a dodgy past but to be frank everyone in Lebanese politics does. There is not a single candidate who could make all sides happy and there is probably not a single candidate who will not abuse his position to one degree or another but if Aoun is willing to at least take care of the countryâ€™s basic needs then most Lebanese would accept his leadership with just the usual contempt and frustration towards their political class which is typical of the Lebanese. 
Lebanon has huge potential to be a successful nation but big challenges must be met with strong, relentless and above all tireless leadership that has a clear vision of what it wants to make the country great again. The President has to be able to balance a relationship with various national (and in some cases sectarian) rival political blocks as well as large international powers, some of which are brutal adversaries, to get the best deal for Lebanon. 
Iran is a country which, like Lebanon, has massive economic opportunities; Lebanon could do very well if they decide to open their doors to Iran on an economic level without childish sectarian restrictions being imposed by Saudi Arabia. 
Long road ahead 
Lebanon is one of a few countries in the middle east with a better educated, modern society which allows many basic freedoms which are considered unacceptable elsewhere in the region. I cannot say in all good continence, that Aoun has what it takes to lead Lebanon to greatness, he has certainly not earned that type of praise from his past exploits. 
I just hope the old boy has a genuine intention as well as the physical will-power to tackle all of Lebanonâ€™s various conundrums. Considering Lebanonâ€™s future now lies in the hands of an 81-year-old right wing Christian who is known by his followers as â€œthe generalâ€ I think you could all understand my concerns following his appointment. 
Lebanon needs new ideas, the Lebanese establishment has been leaning towards the US & Saudi Arabia for years which has produced nothing tangible on any level. Iran has proven itself, (despite what the Saudi or Israeli media have to say) as a more practical, rational and generally sober partner in the region. I have argued that countries like Lebanon should look to explore the possibility of building potentially prosperous relations with Tehran who for a long time been genuinely interested in building working relationships, especially with Lebanon. 
Lebanon needs to get over its old fruitless relationships and open its doors to whoever is willing to provide real tangible economic support, this is key if Aoun wishes to pursuereal internal reform and investment in Lebanonâ€™s knackered institutions. That has to be the priority for any administration seriously planning to turn Lebanon around. 
I hope, for Lebanonâ€™s sake, that Aoun will have the capability to reform Lebanon but given his history, age and the massive mountain of difficulties Aoun needs to drag the country over before noticeable changes can be achieved, you canâ€™t blame me for choosing to remain sceptical

21456,"If Trump Tweets It, Is It News? A Quandary for the News Media - The New York Times",Michael M. Grynbaum and Sydney Ember,"Since Election Day,   Donald J. Trump has proposed a   in American diplomatic relations with Cuba, boasted about negotiations with a major manufacturer, trumpeted false claims about millions of illegal votes and hinted that he might upend current free speech laws by banning flag burning. All in 140 characters or less. As news organizations grapple with covering a commander in chief unlike any other, Mr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter account  â€”   a bully pulpit, propaganda weapon and attention magnet all rolled into one  â€”   has quickly emerged as a fresh journalistic challenge and a source of lively debate. How to cover a presidentâ€™s pronouncements when they are both provocative and maddeningly vague? Does an   tweet amount to a planned shift in American policy? Should news outlets, as some readers argue, ignore clearly untrue tweets, rather than amplify falsehoods further? In interviews on Tuesday, political editors and reporters said that, for now, they planned to apply the same news judgment they would apply to any statement by a powerful leader, even as some acknowledged that social media allows Mr. Trump to reduce complicated subjects to snappy, and sometimes misleading, slogans and sound bites. â€œReporting complex policy issues out of tweets, I would say thatâ€™s not ideal,â€ said Carrie Budoff Brown, the newly installed editor of Politico, adding: â€œWe have to treat it as one piece of a bigger reporting puzzle that we have to put together. â€ But fundamentally, she said, the thoughts of a   are inherently newsworthy  â€”   as long as journalists also provide readers with the right context, like whether a proposal is feasible or legal, or correct a baseless claim. â€œThis is the way heâ€™s communicating with millions upon millions of people, and as journalists we canâ€™t ignore that,â€ Ms. Brown said. Some readers disagree. On social media, there have been calls for news outlets to boycott covering Mr. Trumpâ€™s tweets entirely. Critics say that any coverage elevates unsubstantiated assertions and murky policy suggestions. â€œMedia would be wise to stop   of Trumpâ€™s tweets  â€”   they distract, distort and debase,â€ Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of The Nation, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. The historian Fred Kaplan declared, â€œItâ€™s time to ignore his tweets,â€ echoing others who wondered whether Mr. Trumpâ€™s provocative statements were a deliberate effort to distract journalists. Part of the concern is that Mr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter posts can have a ripple effect in the media ecosystem. Producers of morning shows and newspaper assignment editors wake up to   statements from the future leader of the free world those remarks sometimes dominate coverage for hours. Even if journalists insert caveats or clearly label a statement as false, the remarks still reach a large audience. But many veteran journalists argue that keeping the public in the dark about their presidentâ€™s comments would be a worse sin. â€œAnything that a president would say  â€”   even if it was libelous or scandalous  â€”   itâ€™s the president talking, and I think you report it,â€ said Chris Wallace, the â€œFox News Sundayâ€ host who moderated this yearâ€™s third presidential debate. â€œUnder any definition, itâ€™s news, whether itâ€™s sensible or not, factual or not, productive or not. â€ Mr. Wallace recalled that as a reporter in Washington, he reported   from President Ronald Reagan as he boarded a helicopter to Camp David. â€œAs far as Iâ€™m concerned, this is like Donald Trump making a statement on the way to the helicopter,â€ Mr. Wallace said of the  â€™s tweets. Handling Mr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter account has been a hot topic in big newsrooms. Matthew Purdy, a deputy managing editor at The New York Times, said on Tuesday that the Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks had to be assessed one by one. â€œClearly his tweets are a window into policy decisions or his state of mind,â€ Mr. Purdy said in an interview. â€œJust because he tweets it doesnâ€™t make it news. But just because he tweets it doesnâ€™t make it frivolous either. â€ Steven Ginsberg, senior politics editor at The Washington Post, agreed. â€œMy view, frankly, is that everybody is getting way too caught up with the fact that heâ€™s tweeting,â€ he said, adding that even if Mr. Trump â€œshouts something on a street corner, I think itâ€™s worth taking up on its own merits. â€ â€œIn this postelection period, anything he says in any way you have to consider it and you have to weigh whether it deserves a story,â€ Mr. Ginsberg said. At some publications, the calculus about coverage is more about the resources on hand. At The Los Angeles Times, covering every Twitter post would prevent reporters from focusing on other political issues, like the future of the Affordable Care Act. â€œWeâ€™ve got a smaller staff than some other folks do, so Iâ€™m sure there have been ones that weâ€™ve passed on,â€ said David Lauter, the paperâ€™s Washington bureau chief. Still, Mr. Trumpâ€™s tweets have become particularly intriguing. Typically,   hold news conferences after the election  â€”   but Mr. Trump has not, offering few opportunities for journalists to question him about plans for his administration. (He has granted interviews to â€œ60 Minutes,â€ The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.) â€œThese pronouncements on Twitter are the only available evidence of what the man is thinking, or wants us to think heâ€™s thinking,â€ said Todd Gitlin, a former political activist who has criticized press coverage of Mr. Trump. There is also a novelty factor. American presidents, aware that their words carry gravity and consequence worldwide, are typically circumspect in their remarks, opting for dry statements and withholding major proposals until a legislative or legal framework is in place. Mr. Trump seems to relish doing the opposite, as he did throughout the election season. Jack Shafer, who writes about the media for Politico, said that journalists could ultimately best serve the public by being judicious in the way they report on Mr. Trumpâ€™s tweets. â€œI think that you starve the troll by just pointing out that the troll is lying and the troll is trolling,â€ Mr. Shafer said. â€œDonâ€™t ignore him, but hold him accountable when he tweets for effect. â€ Some have speculated that come January, Mr. Trump may rely less on Twitter, once he moves into the White House and has the Oval Office and West Wing briefing room at his disposal. But asked about this on Tuesday, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, issued a reply: Donâ€™t bet on it. â€œ  Trump has amassed an incredible social media following, one he used very effectively throughout the campaign to communicate his message,â€ Ms. Hicks said in an email. â€œHe intends to continue utilizing this modern form of communication, while taking into account his new role and responsibilities may call for modified usage. â€ For now, Ms. Hicks declined to say if Mr. Trump would move his musings to the White Houseâ€™s official @POTUS Twitter account. As of Tuesday, @POTUS had 12. 3 million followers. And @realDonaldTrump? 16. 3 million."

Scenes at Cannon Ball in North Dakota are turning increasingly ugly as peaceful protestors continue to clash with riot police and the National Guard. The protest concerns the planned drilling in the area to build a gas pipeline. 
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe have spoken out against the plans as they will run through a sacred burial ground in violation of Native American treaties. They have found support and partnership with environmental activists who do not believe that the United States government should be creating new fossil fuel infrastructure. Militarized police tactics escalate at Standing Rock 
Despite the fact that the United Nation has called on the American government to cease construction, the government shows no signs of abating their plans. Instead, they have turned their attention to a brutal crackdown on the protestors. According to a journalist, an activist Erin Schrode, protestors have been maced, beaten with batons, subject to Taser fire and been shot with rubber bullets. 
I canâ€™t believe what is happening here in Standing Rock. Itâ€™s a scene like Iâ€™ve never seen anywhere else in the world, and itâ€™s right here at home. 
Schrode herself had conducted an interview on camera when she was shot with a rubber bullet. In a post on her Facebook profile, she claims that while she was physically unhurt, she was shaken by the attack and simply could not understand why she had been targeted in such a violent way. In an interview with Fusion she said; 
I couldnâ€™t fathom that Iâ€™d just been hit. Why would they target me? Why would they shoot anyone? There was absolutely nothing violent, aggressive, provocative going on at the protests yesterday. 
This entire disturbing incident was caught on camera which Schrode has shared on her Twitter feed. The full video can be viewed here: 
The use of rubber bullets for crowd control has been outlawed in most places in the developed world owing to the number of fatalities and serious injuries they caused when deployed in the long-running conflict in Northern Ireland. Their use in situations without the threat of serious violence is practically unheard of. But despite this unprecedented level of police brutality, the protestors at Standing Rock are not intimidated and will refuse to leave the protest site until construction has ceased or they are forced off the land .

21458,March Madness: What Happened on Day 4 of the N.C.A.A. Tournament - The New York Times,Zach Schonbrun,"It was a tough day for the A. C. C. with Louisville and Duke both getting knocked out in the round of 32, and No. 1 North Carolina narrowly escaping an upset against Arkansas. Hereâ€™s a look at what happened Sunday: Wisconsin, Florida, Baylor and South Carolina. Thatâ€™s what is left of your East region. North Carolina. Thatâ€™s what is left from the Atlantic Coast Conference in the N. C. A. A. tournament, after the No. 7 seed Gamecocks knocked off No. 2 Duke in a stunning upset,   on Sunday night. The winners of the A. C. C. tournament championship in Brooklyn, Duke roared into March like a team finally hitting its stride. Paced by star freshman Jayson Tatum, the conferenceâ€™s leading scorer Luke Kennard, and an enigmatic talent off the bench, Grayson Allen, the Blue Devils were looking like favorites to tear through the bracket, potentially setting up a showdown with top seed Villanova in the Round of 8 at Madison Square Garden. Well, Wisconsin took care of the Wildcats on Saturday. And a day later, South Carolina, playing in front of a raucous crowd just 100 miles from its campus, obliterated Duke in the second half. The Gamecocks had not won an N. C. A. A. tournament game before Friday since 1973. But they played the role of aggressors in the second half against Duke and its   champion coach, Mike Krzyzewski. After making just seven field goals in the entire first half, South Carolina shot 71 percent from the floor in the second, looking quicker, stronger and hungrier than the Blue Devils. Foul trouble kept Kennard from becoming a factor, and South Carolina stretched its zone to really bother Dukeâ€™s shooters. Sindarius Thornwell, who scored 29 points in the Gamecocksâ€™ win over Marquette on Friday, was terrific again, finishing with a   24 points. â€œWhen you shoot 7 for 35 in the first half and youâ€™re down just 7 points, I tell you, it just gives you confidence,â€ Thornwell said. â€œIt was our defense. It kept us in it. We thought we could win the game coming out the second half because of shooting so poorly the first half. â€ Point guard Duane Notice was impossible to keep out of the paint, scoring 17 points on 6 of 8 field goals. North Carolina nearly lost on that same court in Greenville in the game before this one, but the Tar Heels rallied to hold off Arkansas. After No. 2 Louisvilleâ€™s loss earlier in the day, though, the A. C. C. which set a record with nine teams in the tournament, is down to just one: the Tar Heels. Meanwhile, South Carolina moves on to play in New York, where it will face No. 3 Baylor in a matchup that few could have ever seen coming. Oregon is moving on to the round of 16 after coming from behind to beat upstart No. 11 seed Rhode Island,  . Down by eight at halftime, and by 11 with 13 minutes remaining, the Ducks leaned on sophomore Tyler Dorsey (27 points) and junior Dillon Brooks (19 points) to climb back in it. Rhode Island got a huge performance from Stanford Robinson, who scored 21 points off the bench on   field goals, including a   with 2:11 left to give Rhode Island a   lead. A   by Tyler Dorsey tied it 30 seconds later. He would put Oregon up again with 30 seconds left after burying another three. Down   with no timeouts, Rhode Island had one last chance to tie the game. But a long   by E. C. Matthews, defended by Jordan Bell, sailed long. Well, that was interesting. North Carolina narrowly  â€”   narrowly  â€”   avoided being the second No. 1 seed to get knocked off in the opening weekend, beating Arkansas,  . The Tar Heels did not make it easy on themselves. After leading at one point   late in the first half, North Carolina let No. 8 Arkansas creep back and then, finally, take the lead with 12 minutes remaining in the game. The Tar Heels were sloppy with the ball (17 turnovers) and putrid shooting the ball (38 percent from the field). The Razorbacks led by three with just over two minutes remaining. But it seemed as though Arkansas simply ran out of gas. A   run and some energized defensive stands against an exhausted Arkansas team gave the Tar Heels a   lead with 35. 7 seconds left. Arkansas had a chance to trim it but Moses Kingsley missed two free throws. After a missed free throw by Isaiah Hicks, Arkansas guard Anton Beard pulled up for a potential     with 14 seconds left. It clanged off the back rim. Arkansas went scoreless in the final 3 minutes 31 seconds of the game. North Carolina won with its defense, because its offense looked very out of sorts. When Michigan State cut Kansasâ€™s lead to   with 12 minutes remaining, fans buckled up for an exciting finish. Unfortunately, it never came to be. The No. 1 Jayhawks outscored the Spartans,   from that point on to win easily,  . There just was no stopping Kansas out in the open floor. The game became a highlight reel of   and dunks. Four players scored in double figures, led by Josh Jackson (23 points) Frank Mason III (20 points) and Deonte Graham (18 points). Foul trouble for Michigan Stateâ€™s Nick Ward, and a banged up Miles Bridges meant the Spartans were not the same as they had been on Friday. Coach Tom Izzo squeezed everything he could out of his team, but they just ran out of steam. The No. 2 seed in the South region is still alive. Kentucky withstood a late rally by No. 10 seed Wichita State in what was a highly physical, strong defensive matchup, winning,  . The Shockers did not let the Wildcats play their style:   and   . But this young and dangerous Kentucky team proved it could win anyway. The Shockers trailed by five,   with 2:30 left when Landry Shamet was fouled attempting a  . He hit all three free throws to cut the deficit to 2. Shamet hit another   with 55 seconds left to make it a   game  â€”    19 of his 20 points came in the second half. After a Kentucky miss, Wichita had a chance to take the lead. But Malik Monk blocked a deep shot attempt by Markis MaDuffie with 10 seconds remaining. It was one of two blocks on deep shots in the closing seconds that sealed the win and showed how good Kentuckyâ€™s perimeter defenders can be at closing out. After Monk connected on two free throws, making it a   game, the Shockers still had a chance. But Bam Adebayo blocked Shametâ€™s   attempt as time expired. Now itâ€™s getting serious. No. 7 Michiganâ€™s improbable run continued Sunday as it stormed back from a     deficit to upset No. 2 Louisville,   in Indianapolis. The Wolverines have not lost since that plane incident before the Big Ten tournament. Now they are heading to the round of 16. Sophomore forward Mo Wagner had a huge second half, finishing with a   26 points on 11 of 14 field goals to lead Michigan. A Louisville steal and a layup out of the   press made it a   game with just under a minute. But Derrick Walton Jr. drove and scooped it high off the glass with 29 seconds left to put the Wolverines back ahead by 4. Layups by Donovan Mitchell (19 points) kept bringing the margin down to 2. But Michiganâ€™s D. J. Wilson was clutch at the   line, going 4 for 4 in the closing seconds to keep Louisville at bay. Louisvilleâ€™s defense flustered Michigan in the first half, but the Cardinalsâ€™ youth and inexperience showed down the stretch with some bad fouls and stagnant offense. Coach Rick Pitino had cracked before the game that many of his players are so young they did not know who Grant Hill is. On the other side, Michigan, led by seniors Walton and Zak Irvin, still have yet to crack under pressure. Before any   action tipped off, a shockwave was sent around the college basketball world early Sunday: Mike Hopkins, an assistant under Coach Jim Boeheim for 22 years, and the designated    once Boeheim retires, was named the new coach at Washington, according to the Huskiesâ€™ twitter account. The move was initially reported by ESPN. Coach Hop, a respected tactician and recruiter, apparently got tired of waiting. Though he has had offers to leave Syracuse in the past, Hopkins had always remained at the Hall of Famer Boeheimâ€™s side. Boeheim has said repeatedly he intended to retire after the   season. Now, that might have to be seriously  . Or perhaps Hopkins knew it already was. Hopkins, a Southern California native, played for Syracuse and began coaching there in 1995. At Washington, he will inherit a program that had the No. 3 recruiting class in the nation, according to ESPN, although a lot of that depends on what happens with the top prospect Michael Porter, Jr. who has indicated he might reopen his recruitment. It was certainly not a good weekend for Syracuse, which lost in the second round of the N. I. T. on Saturday to Ole Miss.  f"
21459,El Cajon Police Release Video of Fatal Shooting - The New York Times,Christopher Mele,"The authorities in El Cajon, Calif. on Friday released video footage of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed black man, as part of an effort to quell what has been growing unrest in the community since the episode on Tuesday. The footage shed little new light on what happened to the man, Alfred Olango, 38. The video came from two perspectives  â€”   one from a civilianâ€™s cellphone and the other from a surveillance camera at a   window at a taco shop. In both videos, the faces and heads of the officers and Mr. Olango were blurred to appear as gray dots. Also, both videos were taken from a distance. The   surveillance video shows the scene before the shooting and as a patrol car arrived. The second video shows Mr. Olango walking toward an officer and then walking away backward and sideways as the officer approaches. The officer and Mr. Olango, facing each other, then move side to side in tandem six times before a second officer appears. Multiple shots are fired, and a woman can then be heard screaming. The angle and distance of the videos made it difficult to see clearly what happened because one of the officers was standing in front of Mr. Olango when the shooting happened. The police previously said they responded to a report of a person acting â€œerratically. â€ Mr. Olango refused â€œmultiple instructionsâ€ by the first officer to remove his hand from his pocket, the police said in a news release on Tuesday. The officer drew his weapon and pointed it at Mr. Olango while continuing to direct him to take his hand out of his pocket. A second officer arrived and prepared to use an electronic control device. As Mr. Olango paced and the officers tried to talk to him, he â€œrapidly drew an object from his front pants pocket, placed both hands together and extended them rapidly toward the officer taking up what appeared to be a shooting stance,â€ the police said. The object he pointed was a silvery vape smoking device with a    cylinder, the police said. At that point, the officer with the electronic control device discharged his weapon, the police said. Simultaneously, the officer with the firearm discharged his weapon several times, striking Mr. Olango. No gun was found. Mr. Olangoâ€™s mother said during an emotional news conference on Thursday that her son was having a mental breakdown when he was confronted by the police at the taco shop, Reuters reported. The shooting has touched off days of growing unrest and violence in El Cajon, a suburb of San Diego. On Thursday night, about 75 protesters gathered near the scene of the shooting and threw rocks, bricks and bottles at officers, broke windows and jumped on cars, the El Cajon police chief, Jeff Davis, said at the news conference. A San Diego police officer was struck on the head with a brick, the chief said. The officer was not seriously hurt. Four demonstrators were charged with unlawful assembly and one was charged with assault with a deadly weapon for the episode with the officer. The chief was joined at the news conference by religious and civic leaders who said they wanted the community to move forward in peace. Bonnie Dumanis, the San Diego County district attorney, said that the shooting was under investigation and that â€œno decision has been madeâ€ about filing charges. Chief Davis said the department released the footage in the interest of public safety because protests had shifted from peaceful to more violent over the past days. â€œThis is a difficult situation as any law enforcement officer will encounter and not one we seek,â€ the chief said."

The Benedict Arnold of the Republican Party, Paul â€œRatâ€ Ryan, your next President if the globalists get their way. 
People laughed at me when I said back in April, that Paul Ryan would be your next President. How could I be so sure, because he would not actively campaign and endorse anyone, in a meaningful way during the Republican Primary. He filed paperwork to run for President on January 30, 2016. And he is a Clintonista, a globalist, a traitor to the American people. He doesnâ€™t carry the criminal baggage of Clinton, but he supports all free trade agreements, the elimination of all national borders, the weakening of our military. etc., etc. 
Paul Ryan represents the globalists and their Plan B since Hillary Clinton is going to be indicted AFTER the election. 
Please watch the following video and you will see the inescapable conclusion that Hillary Clinton is no longer useful to the globalists and Ryanâ€™s lack of a criminal record , whose election will not spark rioting in the streets from 50% of Americans who do not know any better, and who will do what he is told by the Rothschild/Rockefeller cartel. 
All the documentation you need is on The Common Sense Show. 
Please make this go viral. Awareness of this insidious plot designed to fool the American people can blow this plan up. Every American needs to see this evidence so that even the casual Clinton supporters will not cast their vote for her knowing she will never make it to Inauguration Day."

C. Metro trains and blocking roads. [The video adds a layer of deep detail to a story by Ryan Lovelace in the Washington Examiner earlier this month, â€œHow protesters plan to wreck Donald Trumpâ€™s inauguration,â€ which first reported the efforts of â€œ#DisruptJ20. â€  One activist leader is captured on the Project Veritas video saying: â€œSo simultaneous to the checkpoint blockades in the morning, we are also doing a series of clusterfuck blockades, where we are going to try to blockade all the major ingress points into the city. â€ The blockade plan allegedly included stopping the D. C. Metro, according to an audio recording: So we figured out this, um, the trains pull up, one person is going to lock one end of a chain to an edge, and on the other end of the chain the end of the car, so on and so forth, done. It takes 15 seconds and everyone can leave and literally it canâ€™t go anywhere at that point, its anchored.

If youâ€™re always making excuses to skip the gym, youâ€™ve got to check this out. 
Letâ€™s be honest: We all can use a little extra push to get the most out of our workouts. Now, thereâ€™s one spin studio that has a brand-new approach to take motivation to the next level. At SpinZone NYC, theyâ€™ve got a great new twist to keep riders active and focused the whole 45 minutes: Every one of their bikes is hooked up to a sick childâ€™s life support. 
Too cool! Where do we sign up??? 
If you thought spin class was intense before, just wait until you see this setup. With 16 bikes, each hooked up to the equipment needed to keep one child alive, thereâ€™s no doubt that every bit of effort countsâ€”if you stop pedaling, the machines stop, too. Even with the array of pulsing lights and music weâ€™ve come to expect from spin class, the distinct sound of an EKG flatlining on a 7-year-old can be a powerful motivator to let riders know itâ€™s time to step things up. 
In an increasingly competitive fitness market, the innovative approach at SpinZone NYC is a breath of fresh air, and itâ€™s winning them new customers left and right. With no backup generators and no excuses, theyâ€™ve created exactly the kind of environment people need to get real results. Instructors are always there to offer a word of encouragement and remind cyclists how severe their childâ€™s condition is. And forget about plateauingâ€”once participants make it through a full session with one sick kid, that just means a bigger and sicker child for the next workout. 
â€œI used to make it 30 minutes, tops,â€ said Erika Perry, a regular who says she never breaks eye contact with her kid for extra motivation to keep going. â€œNow I regularly make it the full class. Thereâ€™s something about a child depending on me for survival that really gets me going in the morning. And Iâ€™ve dropped 11 pounds and feel great!â€ 
Wow, it sounds like things are off to a great start! If this catches on, itâ€™s exactly the kind of bold idea that can transform an entire industry. Way to go, SpinZone NYC. Keep on pedaling!"
21464,"Daniel J. Berrigan, Defiant Priest Who Preached Pacifism, Dies at 94 - The New York Times",Daniel Lewis,"The Rev. Daniel J. Berrigan, a Jesuit priest and poet whose defiant protests helped shape the tactics of opposition to the Vietnam War and landed him in prison, died on Saturday in the Bronx. He was 94. His death, at   Hall, the Jesuit infirmary at Fordham University, was confirmed by the Rev. James Martin, editor at large at America magazine, a national Catholic magazine published by the Jesuits. The United States was tearing itself apart over civil rights and the war in Southeast Asia when Father Berrigan emerged in the 1960s as an intellectual star of the Roman Catholic â€œnew left,â€ articulating a view that racism and poverty, militarism and capitalist greed were interconnected pieces of the same big problem: an unjust society. It was an essentially religious position, based on a stringent reading of the Scriptures that some called pure and others radical. But it would have explosive political consequences as Father Berrigan his brother Philip, a Josephite priest and their allies took their case to the streets with rising disregard for the law or their personal fortunes. A defining point was the burning of Selective Service draft records in Catonsville, Md. and the subsequent trial of the   Catonsville Nine, a sequence of events that inspired an escalation of protests across the country there were marches,   the public burning of draft cards and other acts of civil disobedience. The catalyzing episode occurred on May 17, 1968, six weeks after the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the outbreak of new riots in dozens of cities. Nine Catholic activists, led by Daniel and Philip Berrigan, entered a Knights of Columbus building in Catonsville and went up to the second floor, where the local draft board had offices. In front of astonished clerks, they seized hundreds of draft records, carried them down to the parking lot and set them on fire with homemade napalm. Some reporters had been told of the raid in advance. They were given a statement that said in part, â€œWe destroy these draft records not only because they exploit our young men but because they represent misplaced power concentrated in the ruling class of America. â€ It added, â€œWe confront the Catholic Church, other Christian bodies and the synagogues of America with their silence and cowardice in the face of our countryâ€™s crimes. â€ In a year sick with images of destruction, from the Tet offensive in Vietnam to the murder of Dr. King, a scene was recorded that had been contrived to shock people to attention, and did so. When the police came, the trespassers were praying in the parking lot, led by two   men in clerical collars: the big, craggy Philip, a decorated hero of World War II, and the ascetic Daniel, waiting peacefully to be led into the van. In the years to come, well into his 80s, Daniel Berrigan was arrested time and again, for greater or lesser offenses: in 1980, for taking part in the Plowshares raid on a General Electric missile plant in King of Prussia, Pa. where the Berrigan brothers and others rained hammer blows on missile warheads in 2006, for blocking the entrance to the Intrepid naval museum in Manhattan. â€œThe day after Iâ€™m embalmed,â€ he said in 2001, on his 80th birthday, â€œthatâ€™s when Iâ€™ll give it up. â€ It was not for lack of other things to do. In his long career of writing and teaching at Fordham and other universities, Father Berrigan published a torrent of essays and broadsides and, on average, a book a year. Among the more than 50 books were 15 volumes of poetry  â€”   the first of which, â€œTime Without Number,â€ won the prestigious Lamont Poetry Prize (now known as the James Laughlin Award) given by the Academy of American Poets, in 1957  â€”   as well as autobiography, social criticism, commentaries on the Old Testament prophets and indictments of the established order, both secular and ecclesiastic. While he was known for his wry wit, there was a darkness in much of what Father Berrigan wrote and said, the burden of which was that one had to keep trying to do the right thing regardless of the near certainty that it would make no difference. In the withering of the pacifist movement and the countryâ€™s general support for the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, he saw proof that it was folly to expect lasting results. â€œThis is the worst time of my long life,â€ he said in an interview with The Nation in 2008. â€œI have never had such meager expectations of the system. â€ What made it bearable, he wrote elsewhere, was a disciplined, implicitly difficult belief in God as the key to sanity and survival. Many books by and about Father Berrigan remain in print, and a collection of his work over half a century, â€œDaniel Berrigan: Essential Writings,â€ was published in 2009. He also had a way of popping up in the wider culture: as the â€œradical priestâ€ in Paul Simonâ€™s song â€œMe and Julio Down by the Schoolyardâ€ as inspiration for the character Father Corrigan in Colum McCannâ€™s 2009 novel, â€œLet the Great World Spin. â€ He even had a small movie role, appearing as a Jesuit priest in â€œThe Missionâ€ in 1986. But his place in the public imagination was pretty much fixed at the time of the Catonsville raid, as the   half of the Berrigan brothers  â€”   traitors and anarchists in the minds of a great many Americans, exemplars to those who formed what some called the  . After a trial that served as a platform for their antiwar message, the Berrigans were convicted of destroying government property and sentenced to three years each in the federal prison in Danbury, Conn. Having exhausted their appeals, they were to begin serving their terms on April 10, 1970. Instead, they raised the stakes by going underground. The men who had been on the cover of Time were now on the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s   list. As Daniel explained in a letter to the French magazine Africasia, he was not buying the â€œmythologyâ€ fostered by American liberals that there was a â€œmoral necessity of joining illegal action to legal consequences. â€ In any case, both brothers were tracked down and sent to prison. Philip Berrigan had been the main force behind Catonsville, but it was mostly Daniel who mined the incident and its aftermath for literary meaning  â€”   a process already underway when the F. B. I. caught up with him on Block Island, off the Rhode Island coast, on Aug. 11, 1970. There was â€œThe Trial of the Catonsville Nine,â€ a   play in free verse drawn directly from the court transcripts, and â€œPrison Poems,â€ written during his incarceration in Danbury. In â€œMy Father,â€ he wrote: I sit here in the prison wardnervously dickering with my ulcera   animalraising hell in its living space But in 500 lines the poem talks as well about the politics of resistance, memories of childhood terror and, most of all, the overbearing weight of his dead father: I wonder if I ever loved himif he ever loved usif he ever loved me. The father was Thomas William Berrigan, a man full of words and grievances who got by as a railroad engineer, labor union officer and farmer. He married Frida Fromhart and had six sons with her. Daniel, the fourth, was born on May 9, 1921, in Virginia, Minn. When he was a young boy, the family moved to a farm near Syracuse to be close to his fatherâ€™s family. In his autobiography, â€œTo Dwell in Peace,â€ Daniel Berrigan described his father as â€œan incendiary without a cause,â€ a subscriber to Catholic liberal periodicals and the frustrated writer of poems of no distinction. â€œEarly on,â€ he wrote, â€œwe grew inured, as the price of survival, to violence as a norm of existence. I remember, my eyes open to the lives of neighbors, my astonishment at seeing that wives and husbands were not natural enemies. â€ Born with weak ankles, Daniel could not walk until he was 4. His frailty spared him the heavy lifting demanded of his brothers instead he helped his mother around the house. Thus he seemed to absorb not only his fatherâ€™s sense of lifeâ€™s unfairness but also an intimate knowledge of how a manâ€™s rage can play out in the victimization of women. At an early age, he wrote, he believed that the church condoned his fatherâ€™s treatment of his mother. Yet he wanted to be a priest. After high school he earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in 1946 from St.    a Jesuit seminary in Hyde Park, N. Y. and a masterâ€™s from Woodstock College in Baltimore in 1952. He was ordained that year. Sent for a year of study and ministerial work in France, he met some   who gave him â€œa practical vision of the Church as she should be,â€ he wrote. Afterward he spent three years at the Jesuitsâ€™ Brooklyn Preparatory School, teaching theology and French, while absorbing the poetry of Robert Frost, E. E. Cummings and the   Jesuit Gerard Manley Hopkins. His own early work often combined elements of nature with religious symbols. But he was not to become a pastoral poet or live the retiring life he had imagined. His ideas were simply turning too hot, sometimes even for friends and mentors like Dorothy Day, the   of the Catholic Worker Movement, and the Trappist intellectual Thomas Merton. At Le Moyne College in Syracuse, where he was a popular professor of New Testament studies from 1957 to 1963, Father Berrigan formed friendships with his students that other faculty members disapproved of, inculcating in them his ideas about pacifism and civil rights. (One student, David Miller, became the first   burner to be convicted under a 1965 law.) Father Berrigan was effectively exiled in 1965, after angering the hawkish Cardinal Francis Spellman in New York. Besides Father Berriganâ€™s work in organizing antiwar groups like the interdenominational Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam, there was the matter of the death of Roger La Porte, a young man with whom Father Berrigan said he was slightly acquainted. To protest American involvement in Southeast Asia, Mr. La Porte set himself on fire outside the United Nations building in November 1965. Soon, according to Father Berrigan, â€œthe most atrocious rumors were linking his death to his friendship with me. â€ He spoke at a service for Mr. La Porte, and soon thereafter the Jesuits, widely believed to have been pressured by Cardinal Spellman, sent him on a â€œfact findingâ€ mission among poor workers in South America. An outcry from Catholic liberals brought him back after only three months, enough time for him to have been radicalized even further by the facts he had found. For the Jesuits, Father Berrigan was both a magnet to bright young seminarians and a troublemaker who could not be kept in any one faculty job too long. At one time or another he held faculty positions or ran programs at Union Seminary, Loyola University New Orleans, Columbia, Cornell and Yale. Eventually he settled into a long tenure at Fordham, the Jesuit university in the Bronx, where for a time he had the title of poet in residence. Father Berrigan was released from the Danbury penitentiary in 1972 the Jesuits, alarmed at his failing health, managed to get him out early. He then resumed his travels. After visiting the Middle East, he bluntly accused Israel of â€œmilitarismâ€ and the â€œdomestic repressionsâ€ of Palestinians. His remarks angered many American Jews. â€œLet us call this by its right name,â€ wrote Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, himself a contentious figure among religious scholars: â€œ  theological  . â€ Nor was Father Berrigan universally admired by Catholics. Many faulted him for not singling out repressive Communist states in his diatribes against the world order, and later for not lending his voice to the outcry over sexual abuse by priests. There was also a sense that his notoriety was a distraction from the religious work that needed to be done. Not the least of his   battles was with the church hierarchy. He was scathing about the shift to conservatism under Pope John Paul II and the â€œcompany menâ€ he appointed to high positions. Much of Father Berriganâ€™s later work was concentrated on helping AIDS patients in New York City. In 2012, he appeared in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan to support the Occupy Wall Street protest. He also devoted himself to writing biblical studies. He felt a special affinity for the Hebrew prophets, especially Jeremiah, who was chosen by God to warn of impending disaster and commanded to keep at it, even though no one would listen for 40 years. A brother, Jerry, died in July at 95, and his brother Philip died in 2002 at 79. Father Berrigan seemed to reach a poetâ€™s awareness of his place in the scheme of things, and that of his brother Philip, who left the priesthood for a married life of service to the poor and spent a total of 11 years in prison for disturbing the peace in one way or another before his death. While they both still lived, Daniel Berrigan wrote: My brother and I stand like the fencesof abandoned farms, changed timestoo loosely webbed againstdeicide homicideA really powerful blowwould bring us down like scarecrows. Nature, knowing this, finding us mildly usefulindulging alsoher backhanded love of freakishnessallows us to stand."
21465,"In Paris, the Seine Rises to Highest Level Since 1982 - The New York Times",Lilia Blaise and BenoÃ®t Morenne,"PARIS  â€”   Heavy rains in France lifted the Seine on Friday to its highest levels since 1982, threatening Parisâ€™s cultural institutions and soaking the French countryside east of the capital. The Seine has continued to swell since the river burst its banks on Wednesday, raising alarms throughout the city. As of 10 p. m. on Friday, its waters had reached 20 feet. The river was expected to crest on Saturday morning at up to 21. 3 feet, and to remain at high levels throughout the weekend, the French Environment Ministry said in a statement. â€œThe situation is still evolving hour by hour,â€ a deputy mayor of Paris, Colombe Brossel, said at a news conference at City Hall, adding that the authorities estimated that it would take at least a week or more for the water to recede to normal levels, which are typically three to six feet above the standard reference point for measuring the height of the river. Near the Cathedral of   pieces of tree trunks floated along the swollen river. The waters had risen to the waistline of the Zouave, a notable statue next to the Pont de lâ€™Alma that has traditionally been used as a gauge of the Seineâ€™s levels. The cityâ€™s government urged residents to move valuables out of their basements. An art collection had to be removed from the city hall in    a southeastern suburb of Paris. â€œAround the Eiffel Tower, the banks are flooded,â€ said Julien Rogard, 23, an engineer who takes the No. 6 MÃ©tro line, which crosses over the Seine on the Pont de  . â€œWhere we usually can walk, we canâ€™t anymore. â€ The Seine has not overflowed this much since December 1982, when it rose to about 20 feet, but the riverâ€™s level is still short of the 26. 2 feet reached in the catastrophic flood of January 1910. Parisians and tourists thronged to take photos of the swollen river, prompting a warning from Ms. Brossel, who said: â€œThere are still people going on the riverbanks to take pictures. It is not safe. We are asking you to respect the ban on going there. â€ The government has made emergency plans to shift operations from the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace, the seat of the French presidency, to the ChÃ¢teau de Vincennes, a former royal fortress just east of the capital, if the waters go above 21 feet. â€œWeâ€™re not yet at this stage,â€ an official at the general secretariat for national defense and security told the magazine Le Point. â€œFor now, weâ€™re making sure that all plans are ready and that the different measures may be set in motion to ensure the continuation of governmental work. â€ Officials expressed fears that telecommunications and computer equipment on the lower floors of the Foreign Ministry building on the Left Bank could be inundated. They said the ministryâ€™s archives had been moved to the suburbs in 2010 for safekeeping. Across France, 20, 000 households were without power on Friday, mostly in the    area, east of Paris, and in Essonne, south of Paris, a result of the swelling of the Marne and Loing tributaries of the Seine. Workers in Paris erected a special barrier on Friday morning to protect an underground electrical transformer station near the Pont de lâ€™Alma. The substation provides power to about 80, 000 customers in the Seventh and Eighth Arrondissements. The evacuation of artworks from the Louvre, which was closed to visitors, has attracted particular attention. Starting on Thursday, officials at the museum activated an emergency   plan established in 2002, prioritizing the most fragile artworks, such as tapestries. An estimated 150, 000 artworks in storage rooms and an additional 7, 000 pieces in galleries were vulnerable to flooding, and a large portion of those were moved to higher floors as a precaution, officials said. Officials emphasized that no waters had entered the museum. Other cultural institutions that were closed on Friday included the MusÃ©e dâ€™Orsay, which is in a former train station on the Left Bank the MusÃ©e du Quai Branly, which is devoted to   art and the main BibliothÃ¨que Nationale building, named after former President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand. The MusÃ©e Girodet in Montargis, a town about 77 miles south of Paris, suffered heavy damage on Thursday. The museum is devoted mainly to the work of   Girodet, a Romantic painter who died in 1824. Heavy rains also caused deadly flooding in Germany, particularly in the southwestern state of   and in the southern state of Bavaria."
21466,"Ford Move, Cited as Victory by Trump, Has No Effect on U.S. Jobs - The New York Times",Neal E. Boudette,"Judging from a couple of Twitter messages by   Donald J. Trump, he had scored a   victory for American autoworkers by persuading Ford Motor to keep a Lincoln plant in Louisville, Ky. rather than move it to Mexico. The reality proved less straightforward. Ford had never said it was moving a plant to Mexico, only that it was transferring the production of a small Lincoln sport utility vehicle there so it could fully dedicate a Louisville plant to a   model. That decision has now been reversed  â€”   but either way, it will have no impact on jobs at the factory. The plant is already operating virtually around the clock at full capacity. The decision, which Ford Motor said it made before Mr. Trump spoke by phone on Thursday with William Clay Ford Jr. the companyâ€™s executive chairman, will simply keep the current product mix in place at the factory. The Louisville plant will continue making a far larger number of Ford Escapes, a small S. U. V. that is a less luxurious vehicle than the Lincoln model, the MKC. Ford, which during the election campaign was a frequent target of Mr. Trumpâ€™s criticism for moving jobs to Mexico, was no doubt waving a political olive branch by deciding to keep Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky. But the move was largely symbolic. And that Mr. Trump seemingly overstated its impact  â€”   if it proves emblematic of his future dealings with the industry  â€”   could indicate that his promises to save and restore auto jobs may not require significant changes on the part of carmakers. Mr. Trumpâ€™s vows to protect manufacturing jobs in the United States helped him win the support of   voters, including many factory workers in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. He sought to underscore the message in his Twitter dispatches on Thursday night. â€œJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky  â€”   no Mexico,â€ Mr. Trump wrote in a message. In a subsequent post, he wrote: â€œI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!â€ Both posts overstated certain issues. The plant is not primarily a Lincoln plant  â€”   the MKC represents roughly 10 percent of its total output. The MKC is a more expensive version of the Ford Escape, which is a much bigger seller than the MKC. Production of the Escape alone is enough to keep the Louisville plant running at full capacity. Moreover, the decision to keep the MKC in Louisville was made before the two men spoke on Thursday, not as a result of their conversation, according to Ford. â€œWe have been reviewing the sourcing of this product, and Bill Ford spoke to the   yesterday and shared our recent decision to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky,â€ a Ford spokeswoman, Christin Baker, said in a statement on Friday. â€œWe are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U. S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U. S. â€ Fordâ€™s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, held a conference call with analysts on Thursday morning in which he expressed hope that Mr. Trumpâ€™s policies would â€œprovide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here. â€ But how Mr. Trump governs may be â€œa bit differentâ€ from his campaign speeches, Mr. Shanks said. â€œSo letâ€™s just wait and see. â€™â€™ During the campaign, Mr. Trump heavily criticized Ford for deciding to shuffle its manufacturing operations so that all its small cars are made in Mexico. At times, he even suggested hitting the company and others with a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico. Ford has countered that moving   assembly to Mexican plants would have no impact on American jobs. For example, a factory in Wayne, Mich. that now makes the weakly selling Ford Focus compact will be retooled to make trucks and S. U. V. s, which are selling briskly. Ford said the higher profit margins on trucks and S. U. V.s allow it to absorb the higher labor costs of building the vehicles in the United States. The Wayne plant is expected to remain fully staffed with 3, 700 workers. In October, speaking to reporters at an auto technology conference, Mr. Ford voiced frustration with the criticism Mr. Trump was then aiming at the company. â€œLook, we are everything he should be celebrating about this country,â€ Mr. Ford said, noting that the company makes more cars and trucks in United States plants than any of its rivals and that it was investing in its American operations and adding jobs. â€œHe knows all that,â€ Mr. Ford said of Mr. Trump at the time. â€œI canâ€™t control what he says. â€ This week, Fordâ€™s chief executive, Mark Fields, spoke at the Los Angeles Auto Show and reiterated the companyâ€™s commitment to shift assembly of small cars like the Focus to Mexico. The decision on the MKC gave Mr. Ford some good news to pass on to Mr. Trump. Ford wanted to move the MKC to another plant to increase production of the Escape, a change that had been planned for 2018. It could still increase output of the Escape by cutting back the number of MKCs it makes in Louisville, or it could move the Lincoln model to another plant in the United States. The Louisville plantâ€™s work force would remain unchanged even if the MKC were moved to a new factory. The factory employs 4, 500 hourly workers and is operating on three shifts, producing vehicles almost around the clock. In the first 10 months of this year, the plant made nearly 300, 000 Ford Escapes and just over 37, 000 Lincoln MKCs. In the auto industry, plants are considered to be operating at 100 percent capacity if they are running two shifts a day. Most typically produce 200, 000 to 250, 000 vehicles a year."
21467,Obama After Dark: The Precious Hours Alone - The New York Times,Michael D. Shear,"WASHINGTON  â€”   â€œAre you up?â€ The emails arrive late, often after 1 a. m. tapped out on a secure BlackBerry from an email address known only to a few. The weary recipients know that once again, the boss has not yet gone to bed. The   interruptions from President Obama might be sharply worded questions about memos he has read. Sometimes they are taunts because the recipientâ€™s sports team just lost. Last month it was a 12:30 a. m. email to Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, and Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, telling them he had finished reworking a speechwriterâ€™s draft of presidential remarks for later that morning. Mr. Obama had spent three hours scrawling in longhand on a yellow legal pad an angry condemnation of Donald J. Trumpâ€™s response to the attack in Orlando, Fla. and told his aides they could pick up his rewrite at the White House usherâ€™s office when they came in for work. Mr. Obama calls himself a â€œnight guy,â€ and as president, he has come to consider the long, solitary hours after dark as essential as his time in the Oval Office. Almost every night that he is in the White House, Mr. Obama has dinner at 6:30 with his wife and daughters and then withdraws to the Treaty Room, his private office down the hall from his bedroom on the second floor of the White House residence. There, his closest aides say, he spends four or five hours largely by himself. He works on speeches. He reads the stack of briefing papers delivered at 8 p. m. by the staff secretary. He reads 10 letters from Americans chosen each day by his staff. â€œHow can we allow private citizens to buy automatic weapons? They are weapons of war,â€ Liz Oâ€™Connor, a Connecticut middle school teacher, wrote in a letter Mr. Obama read on the night of June 13. The president also watches ESPN, reads novels or plays Words With Friends on his iPad. Michelle Obama occasionally pops in, but she goes to bed before the president, who is up so late he barely gets five hours of sleep a night. For Mr. Obama, the time alone has become more important. â€œEverybody carves out their time to get their thoughts together. There is no doubt that window is his window,â€ said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obamaâ€™s first chief of staff. â€œYou canâ€™t block out a   and try to do it during the day. Itâ€™s too much incoming. Thatâ€™s the place where it can all be put aside and you can focus. â€ President George W. Bush, an early riser, was in bed by 10. President Bill Clinton was up late like Mr. Obama, but he spent the time in lengthy, freewheeling phone conversations with friends and political allies, forcing aides to scan the White House phone logs in the mornings to keep track of whom the president might have called the night before. â€œA lot of times, for some of our presidential leaders, the energy they need comes from contact with other people,â€ said the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who has had dinner with Mr. Obama several times in the past seven and a half years. â€œHe seems to be somebody who is at home with himself. â€ When Mr. Obama first arrived at the White House, his   routine started around 7:15 p. m. in the game room, on the third floor of the residence. There, on an old Brunswick pool table, Mr. Obama and Sam Kass, then the Obama familyâ€™s personal chef, would spend 45 minutes playing  . Mr. Kass saw pool as a chance for Mr. Obama to decompress after intense days in the Oval Office, and the two kept a running score. â€œHeâ€™s a bit ahead,â€ said Mr. Kass, who left the White House at the end of 2014. In those days, the president followed the billiards game with bedtime routines with his daughters. These days, now that both are teenagers, Mr. Obama heads directly to the Treaty Room, named for the many historical documents that have been signed in it, including the peace protocol that ended the   War in 1898. â€œThe sports channel is on,â€ Mr. Emanuel said, recalling the ubiquitous images on the roomâ€™s large   television. â€œSports in the background, with the volume down. â€ By 8 p. m. the usherâ€™s office delivers the presidentâ€™s   daily briefing book  â€”   a large binder accompanied by a tall stack of folders with memos and documents from across the government, all demanding the presidentâ€™s attention. â€œAn insane amount of paper,â€ Mr. Kass said. Mr. Obama often reads through it in a leather swivel chair at his tablelike desk, under a portrait of President Ulysses S. Grant. Windows on each side of Grant look out on the brightly lit Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. Other nights, the president settles in on the sofa under the 1976 â€œButterflyâ€ by Susan Rothenberg, a      canvas of burnt sienna and black slashes that evokes a galloping horse. â€œHe is thoroughly predictable in having gone through every piece of paper that he gets,â€ said Tom Donilon, Mr. Obamaâ€™s national security adviser from 2010 to 2013. â€œYouâ€™ll come in in the morning, it will be there: questions, notes, decisions. â€ To stay awake, the president does not turn to caffeine. He rarely drinks coffee or tea, and more often has a bottle of water next to him than a soda. His friends say his only snack at night is seven lightly salted almonds. â€œMichelle and I would always joke: Not six. Not eight,â€ Mr. Kass said. â€œAlways seven almonds. â€ The demands of the presidentâ€™s day job sometimes intrude. A photo taken in 2011 shows Mr. Obama in the Treaty Room with Mr. McDonough, at that time the deputy national security adviser, and John O. Brennan, then Mr. Obamaâ€™s counterterrorism chief and now the director of the C. I. A. after placing a call to Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan shortly after Japan was hit by a devastating magnitude 9. 0 earthquake. â€œThe call was made near midnight,â€ the photo caption says. But most often, Mr. Obamaâ€™s time in the Treaty Room is his own. â€œIâ€™ll probably read briefing papers or do paperwork or write stuff until about 11:30 p. m. and then I usually have about a   to read before I go to bed, about midnight, 12:30 a. m. sometimes a little later,â€ Mr. Obama told Jon Meacham, the editor in chief of Newsweek, in 2009. In 2014, Mr. Obama told Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan of ABCâ€™s â€œLive With Kelly and Michaelâ€ that he stayed up even later  â€”   â€œuntil like 2 oâ€™clock at night, reading briefings and doing workâ€  â€”   and added that he woke up â€œat a pretty reasonable hour, usually around 7. â€ Mr. Obamaâ€™s longest nights  â€”   the ones that stretch well into the early morning  â€”   usually involve speeches. One night last June, Cody Keenan, the presidentâ€™s chief speechwriter, had just returned home from work at 9 p. m. and ordered pizza when he heard from the president: â€œCan you come back tonight?â€ Mr. Keenan met the president in the usherâ€™s office on the first floor of the residence, where the two worked until nearly 11 p. m. on the presidentâ€™s eulogy for nine   fatally shot during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S. C. Three months earlier, Mr. Keenan had had to return to the White House when the president summoned him  â€”   at midnight  â€”   to go over changes to a speech Mr. Obama was to deliver in Selma, Ala. on the 50th anniversary of â€œBloody Sunday,â€ when protesters were brutally beaten by the police on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. â€œThereâ€™s something about the night,â€ Mr. Keenan said, reflecting on his bossâ€™s use of the time. â€œItâ€™s smaller. It lets you think. â€ In 2009, Jon Favreau, Mr. Keenanâ€™s predecessor, gave the president a draft of his Nobel Prize acceptance speech the night before they were scheduled to leave for the ceremony in Oslo. Mr. Obama stayed up until 4 a. m. revising the speech, and handed Mr. Favreau 11 handwritten pages later that morning. On the plane to Norway, Mr. Obama, Mr. Favreau and two other aides pulled another    as they continued to work on the speech. Once Mr. Obama had delivered it, he called the exhausted Mr. Favreau at his hotel. â€œHe said, â€˜Hey, I think that turned out O. K.,â€™â€ Mr. Favreau recalled. â€œI said, â€˜Yes.â€™ And he said, â€˜Letâ€™s never do that again. â€™â€ Not everything that goes on in the Treaty Room is work. In addition to playing Words With Friends, a   online game, on his iPad, Mr. Obama turns up the sound on the television for big sports games. â€œIf heâ€™s watching a game, he will send a message. â€˜Duke should have won that game,â€™ or whatever,â€ said Reggie Love, a former Duke basketball player who was Mr. Obamaâ€™s personal aide for the first three years of his presidency. The president also uses the time to catch up on the news, skimming The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal on his iPad or watching cable. Mr. Love recalls getting an email after 1 a. m. after Mr. Obama saw a television report about students whose â€œbucket listâ€ included meeting the president. Why had he not met them, the president asked Mr. Love. â€œâ€˜Someone decided it wasnâ€™t a good idea,â€™ I said,â€ Mr. Love recalled. â€œHe said, â€˜Well, Iâ€™m the president and I think itâ€™s a good idea. â€™â€ Mr. Obama and his wife are also fans of cable dramas like â€œBoardwalk Empire,â€ â€œGame of Thronesâ€ and â€œBreaking Bad. â€ On Friday nights  â€”   movie night at the White House  â€”   Mr. Obama and his family are often in the Family Theater, a   screening room on the first floor of the East Wing, watching   films they have chosen and had delivered from the Motion Picture Association of America. There is time, too, for fantasy about what life would be like outside the White House. Mr. Emanuel, who is now the mayor of Chicago but remains close to the president, said he and Mr. Obama once imagined moving to Hawaii to open a   shack that sold only one size (medium) and one color (white). Their dream was that they would no longer have to make decisions. During difficult White House meetings when no good decision seemed possible, Mr. Emanuel would sometimes turn to Mr. Obama and say, â€œWhite. â€ Mr. Obama would in turn say, â€œMedium. â€ Now Mr. Obama, who has six months left of solitary late nights in the Treaty Room, seems to be looking toward the end. Once he is out of the White House, he said in March at an Easter prayer breakfast in the State Dining Room, â€œI am going to take three, four months where I just sleep. â€"

Social media influencers are conducted by various brands and they are instructed to promote specific products and services in exchange for monetary agreements. According to experts, the world of social media and streaming have greatly influenced companies to pay less attention on television advertisements or print media advertising. Most consumers trust the opinions of the social media influencers they follow which include bloggers, pop stars, celebrities, models etc..As a result, brands and retailers try their best to build good long lasting relationships to increase their brand exposure and gain more profits.

Good evening. Hereâ€™s the latest. 1. Signs of friction threatened to undercut a deal between Ted Cruz and John Kasich to coordinate against Donald Trump. Mr. Trump is expected to dominate in Tuesdayâ€™s primaries in five northeastern states, but his delegate count could fall short if he loses in Indiana next week, allowing the rivals to fight it out at the convention. Polls show Bernie Sanders gaining on Hillary Clinton in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Indiana, though she appears ahead in Pennsylvania and Maryland. _____ 2. President Obama, wrapping up a   trip to Europe, said he would send 250 more U. S. military personnel to Syria to help local forces fight the Islamic State. Addressing Europeâ€™s economic and migration problems, he appeared to refer to Mr. Trumpâ€™s divisive politics. Mr. Obama said challenging conditions opened the door to â€œthose who would try to exploit those fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way. â€ _____ 3. The family of Tamir Rice, the    fatally shot by the Cleveland police in 2014, is set to receive $6 million if a court approves.

But, oops, some accidentally exacted their social media revenge on the Food Network star Rachael Ray. (Also oops, we spelled her name Rachel earlier.) _____ 5. Tough news for the Golden State Warriors. Stephen Curry is likely to be out for at least two weeks because of a sprained right knee. The king of   will miss, at minimum, the start of the second round of the N. B. A. playoffs. He took a positive tone on Twitter: â€œThanks 4 all the prayers  messages. Can feel all the positive energy. God is Great! All things considered Iâ€™m Gonna be alright!â€ _____ 6. Football made headlines off the field. A U. S. appeals court reinstated Tom Bradyâ€™s   suspension in the Deflategate case, agreeing that the N. F. L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, had broad discretion to suspend players.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced a â€œroad map for  â€ to help those leaving prison stay out. The plan includes a federal focus on job training and substance abuse treatment before release, and closer monitoring after.

An international panelâ€™s  report on 43 missing Mexican students reverberated through the government of President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. The students had been engaged in a night of confrontation with the police that turned unexpectedly violent before they disappeared, the report said, countering the official narrative that they fell victim to a drug gang. _____ 10. China halted plans for    power stations in many parts of the country after signing the Paris climate accord. That means about planned 200 plants, with a combined generating capacity of 105 gigawatts, may not be built. â€œItâ€™s a lot of power,â€ a coal specialist said. â€œItâ€™s a heck of a lot of power. â€ _____ 11.

21470,Job Creation Slumps in May - Breitbart,John Carney,"Job creation slowed down in May, with total nonfarm payrolls increasing by 138, 000 while unemployment was little changed at 4. 3 percent. Health care and mining saw jobs gains. [Economists had expected nonfarm payrolls to grow by 145, 000 with an unemployment rate of 4. 4 percent.  The number of unemployed at 6. 9 million and the unemployment rate of 4. 3 percent were nearly unchanged from the prior month. Since January, the unemployment rate has fallen by a half a percentage point and the number of unemployed has declined by 774, 000.  Labor force participation declined   of a percent to 62. 7 percent, near the lowest levels since the 1970s. The unemployment rate for whites declined slightly to 3. 7 percent in May. The jobless rate for Asians was 3. 6 percent, for Hispanics 5. 2 percent and for blacks 7. 5 percent. Payrolls grew in health care and mining. Health care added 24, 000 jobs, while mining jobs grew by 7, 000. Employment in restaurants and bars grew by 38, 000. (Amusing aside: the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls bars â€œdrinking placesâ€ in its official releases.) Part time jobs grew by 113, 000, while full time jobs fell by 367, 000. Much of the jobs created in May were in   occupations. Prior months were revised downward. March nonfarm payroll growth came down to 50, 000 from 79. 000. April fell to 174, 000 from 211, 000. The report would appear to support the arguments of President Donald Trump and others that the economy is still running too slowly and would benefit from fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts.  "

21475,Exclusive-Rep. Mark Meadows: I Promised President Trump I Would Negotiate Obamacare Repeal-Replace in Good Faith - Breitbart,Neil W. McCabe,"Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. Mark Meadows (R. . C.) told Breitbart News on Friday that he will work with moderate Republicans to pass better Obamacare    legislation than the bill offered by Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .)  â€”   as part of his understanding with President Donald Trump. [â€œBased on my conversations with the president and the   they want to get it right, and they want to get it done quickly,â€ said Meadows. â€œThey also want to make sure they reduce premiums for Americans â€”  and when that happens, weâ€™re in total solidarity with our president and  . â€  The congressman said the American Health Care Act does not have the mechanisms to reduce premiums, nor costs, until further on down the path of replacement of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. â€œI want to applaud the president, having met with him yesterday,â€ he said. â€œHeâ€™s negotiating in good faith. I committed to him that I would negotiate in good faith,â€ Meadows said. â€œThe only troubling thing that I continue to hear is that no amendments are going to be going to be allowed to be made in order. Certainly, no amendments were supported by either of the chairmen in either of the committees of jurisdiction. â€ As part of his good faith commitment to the president, Meadows said he would work with more moderate Republicans, whose districts are less conservative than his, in order to find common ground. One of the frustrations Capitol Hill conservatives are dealing with is the contrast between the 2o17 repeal effort and the 2015 repeal effort. In December 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate passed an Obamacare repeal bill authored by Rep. Tom Price (R. . ). Price is a physician and now the secretary of Health and Human Services, but in 2o15, he was the chairman of the House Budget Committee. The Price bill was the â€œroot and branchâ€ repeal conservatives demanded from the party. Although it was vetoed by President Barack Obama, conservatives expected the return of the 2015 bill as the opening move, followed by a replacement bill that combined parts of Obamacare that had already become part of the national consensus and a transition period that gave the economy and body politic time to adjust. The RyanCare bill was crafted to be â€œRepealPlus,â€ Meadow said. â€œThe 2015 bill that all of us vote on? He doesnâ€™t want to do,â€ he said. â€œHe is saying that the reason why he doesnâ€™t want to do the 2015 bill is that it wonâ€™t pass in the Senate. Well, my encouragement is to send it over to the Senate and let them amend it and then they can send it back to us. â€ I support my friends @RandPaul, @SenMikeLee, and @tedcruz. Every tax, every mandate, every regulation of #Obamacare needs to go. https:  .   â€”   Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 28, 2017,  Meadows said he does bank on promises of future reform and adjustments. â€œIn Washington, D. C. you have to make the assumption that the only thing that is going to get done is the one thing you are voting on today,â€ he said. â€œHistory shows us that if count on just the thing you are voting on today to get done, that is a more prudent calculation than assuming that you vote on something and assuming youâ€™ll get three or four things that may or may not happen. â€ This    between the two chambers is the normal legislative process Ryan and the Republican leadership are hoping to avoid. If the RyanCare bill can progress through the House and Senate unchanged, then there is no need for a conference to reconcile two versions of the same bill. In a conference, the power shifts to the Senate from the House because a senator chairs the conference committee. For Ryan, the additional risk is that a conference committee is free to produce whatever bill they come up with for votes in the House and Senate. There is a suspicion on Capitol Hill that the RyanCare language is frozen because of agreements made between the Republican leadership and insurance company representatives when the bill was written. Certainly, it is strange for a  bill to be touted as the return of â€œregular orderâ€ when it was developed outside the committees, without hearings. It also has not escaped notice among conservatives that not a single Republican member of either the Ways and Means Committee nor the Energy and Commerce Committee offered amendments to the RyanCare bill in their committee markups. Ryan dropped his bill Monday at 6 p. m. as members were coming back to Washington from the weekend recess and with no outreach to conservative media. A leadership staffer familiar with the RyanCare rollout told Breitbart News that the rollout was part of the partyâ€™s   plan that takes Capitol Hill Republicans from January through Labor Day. January and February were devoted to confirmations and regulatory relief through the Congressional Review Act, the staffer said. March is devoted to passing leadershipâ€™s health care bill, the staffer said. The RyanCare bill is meant to be the first phase of the process, and it is written in such a way as to preserve its status as a privileged motion through the budget reconciliation process. Republicans hold a    majority in the Senate, but for regular legislation, there is a   requirement to close debate and bring up a vote. Because the Republicans do not have the 60 votes required for cloture, they must use the budget track, which means the repeal bill can only address   issues. Further changes to the PPACA legislation are vulnerable to Democratic efforts to extend debate indefinitely as long as they control 41 votes. This maneuver is the filibuster and Republicans are anticipating that once the financial underpinnings of Obamacare are restricted through the budget bill, enough Democrats will participate in the process to pass the additional phases of replacement. As a practical matter, the House Republican Leadership must get to 216 votes, not 218, because there are five vacant House seats. The House Freedom Caucus does not list its members publicly, but during the 2015 fight to     Speaker John Boehner (R. ) it was accepted that the HFC was solid for 30 votes. With 237 sitting Republicans, 22 defections are enough to kill the RyanCare bill on the floor. In the recent past, so many Republicans have bucked the House GOP leaders that the Republicans needed Democratic votes to pass leadershipâ€™s compromises with Obama and the Democrats. There were 67 Republicans who voted against the Dec. 11, 2014 â€œCromnibusâ€ budget deal.   Republicans voted against Ryanâ€™s   budget agreement with Democrats in 2013. In the   fiscal cliff vote Jan. 1, 2013, 151 Republicans voted against the Republican leadership. But these votes were before Ryan took the gavel and Trump moved into the White House. The next hurdle for the American Health Care Act is the House Budget Committee, chaired by Rep. Diane Black (R. . )."

21477,Everybody Is Telling Me That Trump Is Going To Win â€“ So Why Do I Have Such An Ominous Feeling?,Michael Snyder,"Archives Michael On Television Everybody Is Telling Me That Trump Is Going To Win â€“ So Why Do I Have Such An Ominous Feeling? By Michael Snyder, on November 6th, 2016 
I hope that I am wrong. On Tuesday night we will find out who our next president will be, and I have a very ominous feeling about what is going to happen. But all around me there are people telling me that Trump is going to win. They tell me to disregard the polls because they cannot be trusted, and that very well may be true . They tell me that new voters and independent voters will overwhelmingly vote for Trump, and they tell me that it is obvious that Trump has more enthusiasm for his campaign because of the size of his rallies. I have even heard some people say that God told them that Donald Trump is going to win the election. Well, we will find out on Tuesday night who was right and who was wrong. Personally, I donâ€™t know what is going to happen, but I am quite skeptical of Trumpâ€™s chances and I canâ€™t shake this ominous feeling about what Tuesday night will bring. 
Even if Trump could legitimately get the votes that he needs, would the elite just stand by and allow him to win the election? There was evidence of widespread fraud in the last election , and there have already been reports of vote switching in this election . Bev Harris of blackboxvoting.org has been documenting how our elections have been stolen for many years, and at this point I have very little faith in the integrity of our system. 
But I still voted. 
Early voting is available where I live, and on Friday I voted for Donald Trump. 
I just wish that I could believe that my vote is going to matter. On Sunday we got another glaring example of how rigged the system is. In a letter to Congress, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency is ending the investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails . By some miracle, the FBI was able to examine approximately 650,000 emails in just eight days. But there are only 691,200 seconds in eight days. So the FBI somehow reviewed these emails at the rate of about one every second, and now they have conveniently come to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton is totally innocent just two days before the election. 
When this story broke, it really did hit me on an emotional level, and I already detailed my thoughts in an article for The Most Important News entitled â€œ I Just Lost All Faith In Our Deeply Corrupt Legal System And In The Rule Of Law In The United States â€œ. I donâ€™t know how any American is going to be able to have faith in our system of justice after this. We truly do live in a lawless nation, and if the American people elect Hillary Clinton they are willingly choosing lawlessness. 
But letâ€™s pretend for a moment that our elections are completely and totally fair and that Donald Trump has an honest chance. Even though the polls have tightened up over the past week, it is still very difficult to see a path to victory for Trump. 
Virtually everyone agrees that the electoral map gives the Democrats a built-in advantage. In order to win the election, Donald Trump is going to have to win all of the â€œbattleground statesâ€ plus steal a mid-size state from Hillaryâ€™s column. 
For Hillary, there are many paths to victory for her. 
If Hillary Clinton wins Florida, she wins the election. 
If Hillary Clinton wins Ohio, she wins the election. 
If Hillary Clinton wins North Carolina or Arizona, she almost certainly wins the election. 
In order for Donald Trump to win, he has got to win Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Arizona, Nevada and either Pennsylvania or Michigan. 
Of course that is possible, but it is not probable even if the fight was fair. 
And apparently I am not the only one that has an ominous feeling about what is coming. NBC News is reporting on a tremendous surge in emergency food sales as preppers get ready for the outcome of this electionâ€¦ 
In case of an election night Doomsday, preppers are running up sales of emergency survival food. 
While sales for â€œlong term foodâ€ typically see an increase around natural disasters and elections, â€œthis is more intense than what we saw in 2012,â€ said Keith Bansemer, VP of marketing for My Patriot Supply, a manufacturer and seller of survival food. During the previous election his company saw sales double. This time itâ€™s triple. 
â€œWe have everyone we can on the phones,â€ he said. â€œWe are overwhelmed.â€ 
And a Yahoo article is warning that militia groups â€œare preparing for the possibility of a stolen electionâ€â€¦ 
As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
They say they wonâ€™t fire the first shot, but theyâ€™re not planning to leave their guns at home, either. 
Tens of millions of Americans are very deeply emotionally invested in this campaign, and undoubtedly some of my readers will get upset with me for writing this article. 
But I am not writing this article to get people down. In fact, I am strongly urging everyone to vote. 
If you donâ€™t vote now, you may never get a chance to vote in a pivotal election such as this one ever again. 
And everyone needs to be watching for signs of election fraud when they go to vote. People are freaked out about the potential for a stolen election because of what has happened in the past, and we want to do our very best to make sure that it doesnâ€™t happen this time. 
If Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, I will be very, very happy to have been proven wrong. 
And if Hillary Clinton wins, I will take absolutely no joy in being right. 
I truly do believe that this election represents Americaâ€™s â€œlast chanceâ€. The most evil politician in the entire country is on the verge of becoming our next president, and the American people have a decision to make. 
If the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton, I believe that will be the final nail in our coffin. 
So please vote on Tuesday, because the fate of our nation hangs in the balance.

The US military forces have secretly been using an airbase in Tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oil-rich Libya, officials say. 
The announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a Washington Post report on Wednesday. 
Libya has been struggling to contain the Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011.

21481,Selling a Home in the City? Turn Those Quirks Into Assets - The New York Times,Michelle Higgins,"New York City apartments are notorious for their quirks and annoyances, from awkward layouts to windows that face a brick wall. When itâ€™s time to sell, these can be major turnoffs for potential buyers. But, with a little creativity, many of these issues can be minimized, and you donâ€™t have to spend a lot of money to do it. THE PROBLEM Low ceilings THE SOLUTION White paint, tall window dressings and   furniture Using a lighter shade of paint on the ceilings than the walls tends to draw the eye upward and make the ceiling look higher. â€œUse flat, not semigloss, on the crown molding, in the same shade as the ceiling,â€ recommends Pat Christodoulou, who stages   homes in Connecticut and New York. â€œThis gives you an uninterrupted perspective, which results in visually raising the ceiling. â€ If you donâ€™t have moldings, she said, adding a cove molding, which begins on the wall and extends to the ceiling, will create an elongating effect. Minimalist furnishings that sit low to the floor will help increase the impression of height.    sheers will also â€œgive the illusion of larger windows and higher ceilings,â€ said Elizabeth Kee, a broker at CORE in Manhattan, who recently hung   curtains in a $   rental in Chelsea to â€œcreate an optical illusion that the ceilings are soaring. â€ THE PROBLEM Windows that face a brick wall or let in scant light THE SOLUTION Pops of bright color, strategically placed   bulbs or decorative window film â€œAt a window that faced an alleyway or brick wall, weâ€™ve had success with placing a fixture with a daylight florescent bulb behind the curtain,â€ said Jeff Schleider, the senior vice president of Business Development for Citi Habitats. â€œIt gives the illusion of natural sunlight. â€ In a small   on the Upper West Side, where all the windows faced out on an air shaft, Joseph G. Sheehan, a salesman with Bond New York, used â€œcheery yellow drapesâ€ and sheer white curtains to dress up the windows, and bright throws, pillows and rugs to offer â€œa nod to sunlight and brightnessâ€ in the dark space. The apartment, which had originally been listed by another broker for $399, 000, went into contract for $435, 000 just two weeks after Mr. Sheehan brightened it up. Deanna Kory, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group, recommends white shutters or white wooden Venetian blinds with   to   slats. â€œAny light that hits the windows will be reflected favorably and create a lighter feeling within the apartment,â€ she said. Another option: decorative window film, which lets in light while obscuring an unattractive view it can be found at Home Depot from about $25 for elderberry or etched lace designs. Hanging a framed   panel in front of the window offers a similar effect. If youâ€™re willing to splurge, a custom   window may be the solution. Thatâ€™s what a client of Madeline A. McKenna, a broker at Stribling  Associates, did more than a decade ago in a Midtown apartment with â€œa very depressing viewâ€ from the living room. It wasnâ€™t a cheap fix, she said, noting that the multipane frosted window with    inlay cost about $10, 000. But the investment eventually paid off: In 2005, the client was able to sell the apartment quickly, for about $975, 000. â€œWe didnâ€™t have to apologize or make excuses for the ugly window view onto the ugly, dark, dank air shaft. It became a beautiful centerpiece for the living room instead,â€ Ms. McKenna said, adding that the unit sold again, in 2012, for $1. 25 million and was   in 2014, at $1. 35 million, with the same frosted window. â€œSeems everyone likes the aesthetic. â€ THE PROBLEM An awkward layout THE SOLUTION Rework the floor plan The Yorkville, Manhattan, duplex apartment that Jai Lee, a saleswoman at Mdrn. Residential, listed for $599, 000 in July had plenty of assets: â€œThe bathroom was amazing, with heated floor, enormous deep, deep tub and shower heads on both sides,â€ she said. But to get to it, â€œyou had to walk past the open kitchen into the barely   bedroom. â€ Down a spiral staircase from the living room was a finished basement area with a   and small adjoining den. â€œIt certainly was not ideal,â€ said Ms. Lee, who came up with the idea of recasting the downstairs space as an unconventional master bedroom, with the master bathroom upstairs, along with a spacious closet (in what was the old master bedroom). â€œI started selling the idea of using the â€˜masterâ€™ as your own dream   closet, with spa bathroom,â€ she said. To help potential buyers picture her vision, she drafted a new floor plan showing the lower level as a potential bedroom with a   and adjacent office or hobby room. â€œI made sure to only show the listing by appointment,â€ she added. â€œThis way I could control the narrative and envisioning process. â€ The unit sold within a month for the full asking price. THE PROBLEM A   unit with windows facing the street THE SOLUTION Curtains, decorative film or window boxes For   homes, especially those with bars on the windows, Anna Kahn, an associate broker at Halstead Property, recommends installing window boxes. â€œLive flowers add color and take away from the starkness of the grates,â€ she said. Another option: â€œ â€ curtains, which are opaque near the floor and sheer at the top, to â€œallow sunlight to enter the apartment while still providing a sense of privacy,â€ suggested Mr. Schleider of Citi Habitats. Or consider using opaque film: â€œWe sold an apartment with razor wire outside the bedroom windows,â€ said Vivian Ducat, a saleswoman at Halstead, who had covered part of the window, obscuring the wire. â€œEven though everyone opened the windows to see what was out there, they seemed satisfied that the apartment had integrity and could look good, from the look we gave it. â€"
21482,Anthropologists Discover Isolated Tribe Of Joyful Americans Living In Remote Village Untouched By 2016 Election - The Onion - America's Finest News Source,nan,"More Election Coverage Anthropologists Discover Isolated Tribe Of Joyful Americans Living In Remote Village Untouched By 2016 Election Researchers say the newly discovered tribe scored the highest on the Gross National Happiness Index of any society they have ever studied. Close Researchers say the newly discovered tribe scored the highest on the Gross National Happiness Index of any society they have ever studied. NEWS October 28, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 42 Â· Politics Â· Politicians Â· Election 2016 
WALDPORT, ORâ€”A team of anthropologists announced Friday it had discovered an isolated tribe of blissful Americans who have never been exposed to the current presidential campaign or its candidates, noting that the newly identified population lives contentedly in a remote village completely untouched by the 2016 race. 
According to researchers from Lewis & Clark College, the peaceful, secluded community along the outskirts of Oregonâ€™s Drift Creek Wilderness remains uncontacted by political canvassers, pollsters, and the election media, allowing its generally cheerful and affable inhabitants to go about their daily lives without ever encountering a political poll, election news story, campaign ad, soundbite, or stump speech. 
â€œUpon first entering the village, we immediately noticed how relaxed and upbeat the inhabitants appeared, but it wasnâ€™t until speaking with them directly that we understood how insulated they were from the countryâ€™s political climate,â€ said professor Elizabeth Letts, adding that the tribeâ€™s levels of stress, depression, and anxiety were far lower than those recorded over the past 18 months among the broader American populace. â€œThey actually seem to lead gratifying, well-balanced lives. The adults enjoy eight hours of sleep each night, and in place of discussing politics or the latest revelations about the candidates, they were seen regularly smiling or laughingâ€”not cynically, or as a defense mechanism, even, but out of genuine joy.â€ 
â€œIn my 30 years studying human cultures, Iâ€™ve never come across a people so happy,â€ she continued. 
According to Letts, when tribe members were asked their thoughts on major-party candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, they looked puzzled for a moment and then shrugged their shoulders before grinning warmly and continuing on with their day. Similarly, villagers reportedly appeared confused but at ease when asked about the national mood, saying that as far as they could tell, people were feeling pretty good about everything. 
The anthropologists confirmed this sense of tranquility permeated all aspects of life in the tribe, observing that when extended families gathered for mealtimes, the tenor of their conversation remained pleasant and amicable, with no subjects deemed off-limits. Moreover, scientists noted that the village lacked any signage, clothing, or other paraphernalia bearing divisive words or imagery, and residents appeared to trust one another and appreciate time spent interacting. 
â€œWhen I brought out my iPad to show them footage of the recent presidential debates, they immediately became agitated, and several of the children started to cry,â€ said graduate student Lester Reinhold, who explained that the perplexed villagers kept asking him why the people on the screen interrupted each other so often when they didnâ€™t even have anything of value to say. â€œI explained that one of the two people onstage would be their next leader, and they all gasped and recoiled in horror, with many saying they didnâ€™t see how that could possibly be true.â€ 
â€œI then tried showing them an attack ad about Donald Trumpâ€™s comments and actions toward women, but many of them became terrified and began screamingâ€”thatâ€™s when one of the village elders swatted the tablet out of my hand,â€ he added. â€œAfter seeing how upset it made them, I determined that it was in their best interest to keep all audio and video clips from the election cycle away from them for the rest of our onsite study.â€ 
Scientists noted that when they surveyed members of the tribe about their expectations for the future, specifically after November 8, the responses they received were universally optimistic. Every villager, regardless of age, gender, or social status within the community, reportedly mentioned how they anticipated things would continue to go as well as they had been going. 
When asked to name the most pressing issue facing them, a few members of the group reportedly admitted, however, that it had been raining a lot lately, and that a little sunshine might be nice. 
â€œThis is a perfectly preserved community, probably the last of its kind anywhere,â€ said Letts, who expressed concern that outside forces such as the ever-lengthening campaign season and an increase of on-the-ground political operatives in the area threatened to encroach on the tribeâ€™s simpler and more satisfying way of life. â€œEven though theyâ€™re disconnected from much of the modern-day world and the daily news cycle, these individuals seemed to possess something we donâ€™t: a true sense of delight and positivity toward everyday existence, like each new day is a gift to be cherished.â€ 
â€œOur society could learn a lot from these people,â€ she added. 
At press time, sources confirmed a campaign bus could be seen winding its way down a wooded road toward the village. Share This Story: Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter

21483,â€™Merkelâ€™s Migrantsâ€™: Germanyâ€™s Rejected Asylum Seekers Flood Paris,Nick Hallett,"Migrants rejected for asylum by Germany are flooding into the French capital Paris, leaving some migrant centres almost completely full. [Between 50 and 100 rejected asylum seekers are entering France per day, according to figures from Europe 1 Le JDD, causing a new headache for the countryâ€™s authorities and creating a defining issue for the forthcoming presidential election.  Berlin registered some 280, 000 asylum claims in 2016, although over 700, 000 are still being processed. Of these, 162, 510 were filed by Syrians and 127, 892 by Afghans. The vast majority of Syrians receive asylum status if they can prove their identity. However, one out of every two asylum applications from Afghans get rejected. Those rejected migrants, instead of waiting to be deported, then try their luck in a different country. A   asylum centre opened by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo in November is already    and the city has announced the creation of another 200 places to cope with demand. Authorities have been sounding the alarm for the past few days as makeshift camps begin forming in the streets again. Breitbart London reported in November how Parisâ€™s migrant slums were hotbeds of crime, as gangs fought one another on the cityâ€™s streets. Many of migrants had originally travelled to the city after authorities dismantled the infamous â€œJungleâ€ camp in Calais, with large numbers gathering in the Stalingrad district. Footage from April 2016 shows the Stalingrad camp explode in violence as massive riot erupted between over 1, 000 people. Despite being officially broken up, authorities are concerned that the camp and others like it will reform as the new wave of rejected asylum seekers travels across the border from Germany. One local resident said in November: â€œThe stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an unhealthy place to live. The place is dead, no one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. â€"
21484,John Bolton: Only Way to End North Koreaâ€™s Nuclear Weapons Program Is to â€˜End the Northâ€™,John Hayward,"Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton talked about North Korea, Russia, and Syria during his regular visit to Breitbart News Daily on Thursday. [Bolton said Trump was correct to see Syriaâ€™s use of chemical weapons as a threat to the United States.   â€œI think this has been a view that has developed in the United States for a hundred years,â€ he observed. â€œYou know, weâ€™re just past the hundredth anniversary of Americaâ€™s entry into World War I. It was the use of poison gas in World War I that caused people to begin to think about what we now call weapons of mass destruction. It didnâ€™t happen overnight, but today, we include in that category nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and biological weapons. Itâ€™s been a consistent, and I think correct, policy of the United States for decades to prevent the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction and to oppose their use, particularly against innocent civilians. â€  â€œThis attack by the Syrians was as much an act of terrorism as it was an act of military action,â€ he declared. As for policing the use of WMD, Bolton pointed out that â€œnobody else is going to do it, anywhere in the world, letâ€™s not kid ourselves. â€  â€œNot the United Nations, not the European Union, certainly not Russia or China, who are, by the way, themselves likely violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. We did it, and we did it because weâ€™re going to make it clear that you donâ€™t use weapons of mass destruction,â€ he said. â€œI think it was a precise and limited rationale and a very precise strike,â€ he judged. â€œI think it has almost no implications for the conflict in Syria, the civil war there. â€  â€œNow, I know in the past four or five days since the attack, those who advocate more U. S. involvement in the Syrian civil war have said thereâ€™s a dramatic change in policy, and theyâ€™re in favor of it. Many who oppose greater U. S. involvement in the Syrian civil war have said itâ€™s a dramatic change in policy, and they oppose it. Theyâ€™re all wrong. I donâ€™t think this is a change of policy with respect to Syria. I think itâ€™s about weapons of mass destruction,â€ he said. SiriusXM host Alex Marlow brought up the rumors that President Trump ordered the Syria strike as an â€œemotional responseâ€ by members of the Trump family to photos and videos of chemical attack victims, especially the children. â€œI donâ€™t think you should respond to strategic threats with an emotional response,â€ said Bolton. â€œI know that sounds   to some people, but I think thatâ€™s the reality that the    has to face. I donâ€™t know exactly what the role of the presidentâ€™s family was in persuading him to do this. â€  â€œI would say we would test that over the next several weeks,â€ he proposed. â€œFor example, many who want greater U. S. involvement on the side of the opposition, the rebels in Syria, have said, â€˜Well, what difference does it make if Assad uses chemical weapons to kill innocent men, women, and children one day and uses cluster bombs or barrel bombs the next day? The people are just as dead.â€™ Thatâ€™s an argument that says once you see an atrocity  â€”   and Secretary of State Tillerson said that weâ€™ll come to the protection of innocents all over the world. â€  â€œI said before, strategic analysis can be  . Itâ€™s certainly the case that the victims of these attacks are just as dead, no matter what the methods used. But I would say there is a strategic difference and a real difference for the United States whether the brutality is carried out by conventional means or by weapons of mass destruction,â€ said Bolton.  â€œWe are not going to stop all brutality around the world. I think itâ€™s inherent in human nature, among other reasons,â€ he acknowledged. â€œBut we can say with this category of weapon  â€”   biological, chemical, and nuclear  â€”   they are different. Theyâ€™re different because of their capacity to kill in large numbers and the nature of the regimes that use them. â€  â€œThis is a complex subject. I canâ€™t prove this moment that the presidentâ€™s going to stick to the line that he articulated or that maybe there will be an emotional response after another Syrian attack or an attack by somebody else. But I can say where we are right now on this retaliatory action against Syriaâ€™s use of chemical weapons, I think weâ€™re right where we should be,â€ he contended. Marlow noted that many of Trumpâ€™s voters disagree with traditional Republican foreign policy by failing to see even a heinous deployment of chemical weapons in distant lands as a direct threat to the United States. â€œI think that the efforts weâ€™ve made over the years to prevent the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction demonstrates why we think it is a threat to the United States,â€ Bolton countered. â€œWe donâ€™t want more countries to have nuclear weapons. We donâ€™t want more countries to have chemical and biological weapons. â€ â€œSome people say thereâ€™s a huge difference between chem and bio on one side and nuclear on the other. Never forget that analysts call chemical and biological weapons â€˜the poor manâ€™s atomic bombâ€™ because it takes an awful lot less to create those kinds of weapons than the nuclear side,â€ he pointed out.  â€œThere have been technological reasons that itâ€™s been hard to use chemical and biological weapons because when you deliver them via artillery shell, the explosive force of the shell destroys much of the weapon  â€”   which is why more sophisticated techniques are now being used, using ventilation systems at domed stadiums, for example, or large office buildings and that sort of thing. Put the chemical or biological weapon in the ventilation system and let it reach tens of thousands of people that way,â€ he said.  â€œDonâ€™t underestimate the extent to which terrorists and others would love to perfect these weapons to use against us,â€ Bolton warned. â€œIn the caves of Afghanistan, in  â€™s files, we found after the overthrow of the Taliban that   had been pursuing weapons of mass destruction almost from its inception. I think saying to everybody, â€˜Donâ€™t even think about using these weaponsâ€™ ultimately safeguards the United States more than anybody else because of our presence all around the world. â€ Bolton said it was difficult to have complete confidence that Trumpâ€™s strike on Syria would be a â€œ â€ action with no implications for deeper involvement but added that â€œas of now, when you listen to the president, his rationale has been very limited and very precise. â€ â€œIt is true that some of his senior advisers have been much more expansive in what theyâ€™re saying and have given the indication that they would like nothing more than to get further military activity underway,â€ he acknowledged.  â€œI thought perhaps the most disturbing thing that I heard yesterday at the press conference in Moscow between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was an observation that Lavrov made. I just want to say, for all the obvious reasons that you and your listeners can understand, I donâ€™t want to be in a public spitting contest with Rex Tillerson, but I would say this if Mother Teresa had made this comment,â€ Bolton said.  â€œLavrov said that Rex Tillerson told him he didnâ€™t care about history he just wanted to solve the current problems that we have. I hate to say I agree with Lavrov, but he went on to say you canâ€™t solve todayâ€™s problems unless you understand the history. This temptation to say, â€˜Well, the new guys are here. Weâ€™re the pros from Dover. We know how to do it. Weâ€™ll take care of itâ€™ is a risk, a risk of expanded activity without a strategic rationale behind it,â€ he cautioned.  â€œI think what weâ€™ve got now is, weâ€™re in the right place, and I think the president should hear from his supporters the positive reinforcement that we understand the rationale for the strike against Syria, that we support it, and we think itâ€™s just fine to stop there,â€ he said. Bolton sought to avoid hyperbole in describing the dismal state of relations between the United States and Russia. â€œIn the midst of the politics that we found ourselves the last eight months, where after forty years of finding it difficult to stand up to the Soviet threat, the Democrats pretended to be the only defenders of America against the Manchurian candidacy run by Moscow that would convey Donald Trump into the White House, where he would do their bidding,â€ he observed sarcastically. Bolton speculated that Trump â€œfeels that Russian complicity, quite possibly, in this chemical weapons attack, certainly Russian efforts to cover it up after the fact through disinformation, have made it impossible for him to do what he hoped to do, which is see if he could better relations. â€ â€œOf course, heâ€™s frustrated by that. I think anybody would be. Iâ€™m not so frustrated by it in the sense I fully expected it. Part of assuming the office is learning in a very personal sense some hard truths out there,â€ he said. Bolton found more hard truths to be learned in North Korea, where he said there was no doubt that â€œbecause of eight years of the Obama administration doing nothing, under the guise of a policy they called â€˜strategic patience,â€™ which was really a synonym for doing nothing, North Korea is perilously close to having the capability to put a nuclear device under the nose cone of an ICBM and land it on the United States. â€ â€œThere is interesting testimony, I think it was just last week, by the commander of the U. S. Strategic Command, who said that of all the things you need to do to have a worldwide ballistic missile delivery capability for nuclear weapons that he doesnâ€™t think the North Koreans have is the miniaturization issue  â€”   taking the nuclear device and putting it in a small enough package that it can actually be delivered via missile,â€ Bolton said. â€œSince we know that Russia and China both obviously mastered that a long time ago, you have to worry that the North may be even closer than we thought,â€ he continued. â€œThe estimates were they were close to that point, people said, within a few years. There are people at the Pentagon, serious people, who believe that it could be 2018. Thatâ€™s why I think thereâ€™s real concern about whatâ€™s going on. â€  â€œI think itâ€™s coupled with the disarray in South Korea, where theyâ€™ve just had their president impeached  â€”   an election coming up next month that could return a   administration, which would be a real problem for us. So I think thereâ€™s good reason to be concerned,â€ he added.  â€œYou ask what the   solution is. I believe this: North Korea will never be talked out of its nuclear weapons  â€”   not by diplomacy, not be economic pressure. People in North Korea live a prison camp now. The regime doesnâ€™t care about their economic  . They care about staying in power. A nuclear weapon is the regimeâ€™s ace in the hole to stay in power,â€ he contended. â€œI think the only   way to deal with the North Korean nuclear weapons program is to end the regime in North Korea,â€ Bolton advised. â€œReunite the Korean peninsula. Itâ€™s not enough to pressure China to impose sanctions on North Korea. They need to understand that this regime poses a threat to stability in the region that undermines their security as well. We need to bring them to the realization that reunification is going to happen one way or the other. We can either do it the sensible way, or it will happen in a much more threatening way. I donâ€™t pretend thatâ€™s easy, but thatâ€™s the real solution. â€ He said if reunification occurs, the â€œ â€ necessary to repair   North Korea would be done by the Korean people themselves. â€œTo return to the German analogy, the country in the North Atlantic region that wanted German reunification most was the United States,â€ he noted. â€œThe other European powers feared it, the West Germans thought it would cost too much, but ultimately, it was the United States that prevailed. I think the same thing is true here. â€  â€œThe South Koreans are worried about their pensions. In fact, the reunification of the two Koreas would produce an economic boom for South Korea,â€ he argued. â€œA huge labor force in the North that would become available to their capital investments  â€”   boy, I tell you, the Korean peninsula would just take off after reunification. â€ â€œWhat China needs to be convinced of is that they wouldnâ€™t see American troops on the Yalu River, the border with China, after reunification,â€ Bolton stressed. â€œThey saw that movie in 1950. They didnâ€™t like [it] then. They donâ€™t like it now. Fortunately, we donâ€™t want to be on the Yalu River either. We want to be at the southern tip of the peninsula so we can deploy elsewhere in East Asia if thereâ€™s a crisis. Thereâ€™s a deal there. â€  â€œAs I say, itâ€™s not easy. I donâ€™t underestimate it. But thereâ€™s a way to do this if we start now and persist on it,â€ he said.  â€œI would be very wary of Chinese assurances that theyâ€™re going to help persuade North Korea to give up the nuclear weapons program,â€ Bolton cautioned. â€œTheyâ€™ve said that for 25 years, and they havenâ€™t done a single thing to materially impede North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program. I think further discussions with North Korea, further efforts to pressure North Korea, are basically a waste of time. The way to end the Northâ€™s nuclear program is to end the North  â€”   merge it, reunify it with South Korea. â€ John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

â€œWe are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era,â€ said Dr. Cornel West , the nationâ€™s most prominent Black public intellectual, assessing the import of last weekâ€™s election. West backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, then endorsed the Green Partyâ€™s presidential ticket. The election â€œdid not go left-populist, following Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein,â€ he said. Instead, â€œit went rightwing-fascist.

Duboisian scholar Dr. Anthony Monteiro was among the few observers on the Left that thought Donald Trump would win at the polls. But, even he was startled at the scope of Trumpâ€™s sweep. â€œI felt that the insurgency would grow and deepen, but I never thought that it would become an insurrection,â€ said Monteiro. â€œIn a certain sense, white working and poor people in these small, rust belt towns have a sense of achievement in having brought the Clintons down that Black people had in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected with a huge Black turnout,â€ he said.

The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations adopted a 19-point Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, at a conference in Washington. The document applies the principle of self-determination to the broadest range of issues, from Black Community Control of the Police, to Mass Black Incarceration, to Nationalization of the Banks. â€œEverybody wants self-determination,â€ said Coalition chairman Omali Yeshitela , â€œbut what does it mean, practically?â€ The 19 points give direction to the struggle. â€œThis isnâ€™t something you work on every four years,â€ said Yeshitela. â€œThis is something you work on every day. This is our program.â€ 
Margaret Kimberley , an editor and senior columnist for Black Agenda Report, told the conference: â€œWhen we meet together, today, we are showing the world what self-determination looks like.â€ Voting for â€œyour enemiesâ€ is not self-determination, and â€œthinking that electoral politics is the only road to liberation is not self-determination,â€ said Kimberley.

21486,Trump Halts U.S. Funding of United Nations Population Fund,Dr. Susan Berry,"President Trumpâ€™s administration is ending U. S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund  â€”   an agency that human rights activists have linked to the support of population control programs such as Chinaâ€™s coercive abortion â€œ  policy. â€[The halt to the funding of the United Nations Population Fund  â€”   known as UNFPA  â€”   comes as Trump is scheduled this week to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the presidentâ€™s    resort in Florida.  In January, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the â€œMexico City Policy,â€ which concerns U. S. aid for abortions overseas. The president updated the policy by directing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to implement a plan that expands the policy across all global health assistance funding. The directive means that U. S. taxpayer dollars will no longer be supporting organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program, such as that espoused by China. A report by the Associated Press states that as a result of the end of U. S. funding of UNFPA, $32. 5 million will shift to the U. S.

At a Florida rally, Hillary Clinton used the horrific 9/11 terrorist attacks to pander to her supporters, and told a massive lie in the process. 
â€œI know what happened not far from here at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando,â€ Hillary said. â€œI was in New York City on 9/11 as one of the two Senators. I will defeat ISIS. I will protect America.â€ 
Watch:

But hereâ€™s the thingâ€¦ Hillary wasnâ€™t actually there on 9/11, and itâ€™s common knowledge. 
TellMeNow reported: 
She went to New York City the following day, but she definitely wasnâ€™t there on the day of the terrorist attacks. She toured the area on 9/12 with Mayor Rudy Giuliani then hightailed it back to DC. She didnâ€™t get her hands dirty. She went for a short photo op and now she canâ€™t even get the facts of that straight. 
It is sickening that someone would use such a tragedy for personal gain, but then, this is Hillary Clinton weâ€™re talking about. She left four Americans to die in Benghazi, she threatened women who were assaulted by her own husband, she laughed about getting a child rapist off the hook, and the list goes on and onâ€¦ She is heartless."
21488,HIDDEN CAM: FBI Botched First Clinton Investigation â€“ Why Trust Them Now?,Rachel Blevins,"We Are Change 
The FBI is on round two of their investigation into the emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton on her private server, and a recently released undercover video serves as a reminder of everything that was wrong with the initial investigation. It all starts with who they did and did not interview.
In March 2015, reports first surfaced revealing that Clinton did not have a government email address, and opted to use her personal address during her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Reports then concluded that her private address was linked to a private server at her home in Chappaqua, New York.
However, the FBI did not publicly admit that they were conducting an investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information until June 2016, when FBI general counsel James Baker sent a letter to the State Department confirming that there was, in fact, an â€œongoing investigation.â€ 
The public knowledge of Clintonâ€™s email practices came about because she was already being investigated by the House Select Committee on Benghazi for her involvement in the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghzi, Libya.
Despite the fact that a former Secretary of State who was already being investigated , admitted that she used a private server for government business, and then told the public that she deleted 33,000 emails, the FBI still waited nearly a year to confirm that they were conducting an investigation into her email practices.
According to a recent video from Project Veritas, the FBIâ€™s initial investigation into Clintonâ€™s email was not nearly as thorough as it should have been.
The undercover report revealed that State Department IT Systems Administrator Cindy Almodovar knew of Clintonâ€™s email practices in 2010, and even â€œmet with Huma Abedin for 30 minutes regarding emails at the then unknown, but now notorious, @clintoneail.com site.â€ 
However, Almodovar claims in the video that she was never interviewed by the FBI in connection with their investigation, despite the fact that her name was mentioned in the emails and her knowledge of Clintonâ€™s practices was clear.
While the FBI failed to interview Almodovar, they did manage to interview Clintonâ€™s close confidante and top aide: Huma Abedin.
At the time, Adedin swore under oath that she turned in all of the â€œall of the devicesâ€ she owned that contained State Department emails. However, the FBI now claims to have found â€œtens of thousandsâ€ of emails belonging to Abedin on the laptop of her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. Weiner is currently being investigated for engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage girl.
Some sources have said that Clinton is â€œlikely to be indictedâ€ this time around, but this comes after FBI Director James Comey laid out of all of the reasons Clinton should have been arrested in the first investigation, and then ultimately defended her.
Why should we trust that Comey and the FBI will get it right this time around? With all of the recent revelations from WikiLeaks and Project Veritas coming together, it serves as a reminder that itâ€™s not just about Clinton this time. It is not about both Hillary Clinton and the entire FBI being held accountable for their actions.

21489,â€˜Hidden Figuresâ€™ Ties â€˜Rogue Oneâ€™ at Box Office - The New York Times,Brooks Barnes,"LOS ANGELES  â€”   It was a surprise photo finish at the weekend box office, with the   drama â€œHidden Figuresâ€ and â€œRogue One: A Star Wars Storyâ€ each selling an estimated $22 million in tickets at North American theaters. Most analysts had expected â€œRogue Oneâ€ (Disney) to easily repeat as the No. 1 multiplex attraction. The â€œStar Warsâ€ spinoff has now collected about $477. 3 million over four weeks. Overseas, it has taken in another $437 million. But in its first weekend in wide release â€œHidden Figuresâ€ (20th Century Fox) about unsung black heroines in the NASA space race of the 1960s, was lifted by strong reviews, an aggressive   marketing campaign that included a   appeal to faith audiences, and attention on Hollywoodâ€™s annual awards circuit. Fox said â€œHidden Figures,â€ directed by Theodore Melfi and starring Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle MonÃ¡e, did particularly well in San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and Cleveland. Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, â€œHidden Figuresâ€ received an   grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. The movie was most popular with women (64 percent of the audience) and people over the age of 35 (about 56 percent of attendees). The animated musical â€œSingâ€ (Universal) was next in line, taking in about $20 million, for a   domestic total of $213. 4 million. The weekendâ€™s other new   movie, â€œUnderworld: Blood Warsâ€ (Sony) only managed $13 million in ticket sales, or nearly 50 percent less than the initial results for its 2012 franchise predecessor. Sony noted that â€œBlood Warsâ€ also cost half as much to make  â€”   about $35 million  â€”   and has already taken in $45 million overseas. Sony also blamed winter storms in the Eastern United States for decreasing turnout. Among specialty releases: â€œManchester by the Seaâ€ (Roadside Attractions) sold about $2. 5 million in tickets in 1, 054 theaters, lifting its total to $34 million â€œPatriots Dayâ€ (CBS Films and Lionsgate) about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, had $105, 000 in seven locations, ahead of its nationwide release on Friday."
21490,Federal Law Doesnâ€™t Require Healthcare Providers to Report FGM Despite Half a Million â€™At Riskâ€™,Michael Patrick Leahy,"The barbaric practise of female genital mutilation  â€”   a procedure made unlawful by the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996  â€”   has been thrust to the fore of public debate in the United States following the arrests of Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, and Attarâ€™s wife Farida in Michigan this month. [According to reports, several young Somali girls were brought from Minnesota, one of   states that have passed legislation to make female genital mutilation (FGM) illegal according to state laws, to Michigan, one of   states in which FGM has not been made illegal in state law, where Dr. Nagarwala, with assistance from Mrs. Attar, performed the procedure outlawed by federal law in a medical office owned by Dr. Attar.  â€œSince 1996, there have been specific federal criminal penalties for performing   in the United States on anyone under 18 years old, including fines, up to 5 years in prison, or both. In 2013, Congress amended the federal statute related to   to criminalize the knowing transportation of a girl under 18 years old from the United States for the purpose of performing   abroad â€”  often referred to as â€˜vacation cutting,â€™ â€ according to the June 2016 Government Accountability Officeâ€™s report Female Genital  . The current federal statute, which codifies both the 1996 law and the 2013 law can be seen here at U. S. Code Title 18  Part I  Chapter 7  Â§ 116  â€”   Female genital mutilation. Surprisingly, neither the 1996 federal law that outlawed FGM, nor the 2013 federal law that outlawed â€œvacation cuttingâ€ requires health care providers to report known or suspected instances of FGM to local, state, or federal health authorities or law enforcement. Current federal law criminalizes the practice of FGM, but does not specifically require reporting on it, though health care providers are obligated to report instances of child abuse, a category in which FGM falls. With this paucity of reporting data, two recent studies, one by the Population Reference Bureau (PRB) another by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have used demographic analysis to estimate that the number of women who have â€œundergoneâ€ FGM or are â€œat risk of the procedureâ€ in the United States exceeds 500, 000. â€œFemale genital   ( ) involving partial or total removal of the external genitals of girls and women for religious, cultural, or other nonmedical reasons, has devastating immediate and   health and social effects, especially related to childbirth,â€ the Population Reference Bureau (PRB) a   research organized funded in part by the Bill  Melissa Gates Foundation, reported in February 2016. â€œIn 2013, there were up to 507, 000 U. S. women and girls who had undergone   or were at risk of the procedure, according to PRBâ€™s data analysis. This figure is more than twice the number of women and girls estimated to be at risk in 2000 (228, 000). The rapid increase in women and girls at risk reflects an increase in immigration to the United States, rather than an increase in the share of women and girls at risk of being cut. The estimated U. S. population at risk of   is calculated by applying   and     prevalence rates to the number of U. S. women and girls with ties to those countries,â€ PRB reported. PRBâ€™s â€œat riskâ€ estimates were based on demographic analysis, rather than actual reported incidents of FGM in the United States. They made the common sense assumption that young girls raised in immigrant households where the country of origin is one where the FGM incidence has been documented to be high are â€œat riskâ€ since those cultural practices are not left in the home country by the family but are likely to continue in the United States. â€œJust three sending countries â€”  Egypt, Ethiopia, and Somalia â€”  accounted for 55 percent of all U. S. women and girls at risk in 2013 (see Table 1). These three countries stand out because they have a combination of high   prevalence rates and a relatively large number of immigrants to the United States. The   prevalence rate for women and girls ages 15 to 49 is 91 percent in Egypt, 74 percent in Ethiopia, and 98 percent in Somalia. About 97 percent of U. S. women and girls at risk were from African countries, while just 3 percent were from Asia (Iraq and Yemen),â€ PRB explained. â€œ  has gained attention in the United States in part because of the rising number of immigrants from countries where   is prevalent, especially   Africa. Between 2000 and 2013, the   population from Africa more than doubled, from 881, 000 to 1. 8 million,â€ the PRB report added: This type of violence against women violates womenâ€™s human rights. There are more than 3 million girls, the majority in   Africa, who are at risk of   each year. In Djibouti, Guinea, and Somalia, nine in 10 girls ages 15 to 19 have been subjected to  . Some countries in Africa have recently outlawed the practice, including   but progress in eliminating the harmful traditional practice has been slow. 1 Although   is most prevalent in   Africa, global migration patterns have increased the risk of   among women and girls living in developed countries, including the United States. â€œCDC published a report in 2016 estimating that 513, 000 women and girls in the United States were at risk of or may have been subjected to   in 2012,â€ according to the June 2016 Government Accountability Officeâ€™s report Female Genital  . The CDC report found the virtually the same results PRB found using 2013 data: While subject to certain limitations, this represents a substantial increase â€”  about threefold â€”  from CDCâ€™s prior estimate of 168, 000, which was based on 1990 data. CDC attributed this increase to a sharp rise in recent decades in the U. S. population originating from countries where   is commonly practiced, and noted that the increase occurred despite   prevalence not increasing or seemingly falling in many of these countries. â€œIn the report for the 2012 estimate, the authors said that until scientifically valid data are collected, the approach used provides the best available information on the potential levels of â€ GAO wrote: CDC and others have acknowledged that collecting more scientifically valid data would be difficult due, in part, to the cultural and legal sensitivity of theinformation needed. International efforts to collect data on the actual occurrence of   have faced similar challenges. Starting in October2015, however, the United Kingdom began requiring health care providers in England to report through a nationwide database any instance of   described to them or discovered during physical exams. (emphasis added) Recent press reports indicate that the methodologies used in both the CDC report and the PRB report are supported by at least one instance where health care providers actually tracked the incidence of  FGM among recent immigrants to the United States from a country in which it is a very common cultural practice. â€œIn Phoenix, Arizona, a staggering 98 percent of Somali women being treated at the Refugee Womenâ€™s Health Clinic have been circumcised, founder Dr. Crista Johnson said. She estimates the Somali community is at least â€ NBC News reported in 2014. But the work by the Refugee Womenâ€™s Health Clinic in Phoenix accurately reporting on the incidence of FGM among recent immigrants to the United States is the exception in a public health system that is not required to specifically report suspected or actual incidents of FGM by law in most jurisdictions and is reluctant to do so for a variety of ideological and institutional reasons. â€œDespite the fact that FGM in all forms has been explicitly illegal in the United States since 1996, legislation criminalizing the practice has not been comprehensively implemented or enforced, and community members, social service providers and law enforcement officials often fail to identify, report or investigate incidents of FGM,â€ Sanctuary for Families reported in 2013: Anecdotal evidence indicates that female genital mutilation also continues to be performed within the United States. Typically, FGM in the U. S. is carried out by traditional practitioners who operate covertly and illegally. When U. S. health care providers carry out the procedure, they frequently come from countries where the practice is prevalent, and they operate on girls from their own communities at the request of a childâ€™s parents. â€œSome states have enacted laws specifically criminalizing   while other states may pursue   offenses under other related statutes, such as child abuse laws,â€  according to the June 2016 Government Accountability Officeâ€™s report Female Genital  : In some instances, states require that an occurrence of   be reported. DOJ indicates that two states, Illinois and Tennessee, have mandatory reporting for  . All states have mandatory reporting laws governing child abuse, which may apply to reporting   depending on the relevant circumstances and particular statutory requirements. Some state laws address other areas of   such as provisions prohibiting â€œvacation cuttingâ€ or provisions for community education and outreach. â€œLocal law enforcement and child protection officials told us that immigrant communities may underreport due to cultural norms, victimsâ€™ reluctance to betray their community or family members, and concern about potential effects on their immigration status and that of their family members. In addition, although many professionals who may be in contact with girls at risk for   are mandatory reporters (e. g. health care, school, and child care officials) they may be uncertain about whether   should be reported,â€ according to the Government Accountability Officeâ€™s June 2016 report Female Genital  : For example, health care providers we spoke with stated that they may not report instances of girls being at risk of or subjected to   due to uncertainty about mandatory reporting requirements (e. g. if   occurred before arriving in the United States) or because they prefer to counsel parents on the consequences of   to change parentsâ€™ position on the issue. School officials we spoke with had little or no experience encountering   among their students, in general, and school officials may not be certain of what actions are appropriate when they encounter suspicions of   which can affect reporting. For example, an official from a nongovernmental organization that works with Somali women said teachers contacted them for guidance on dealing with suspicions of vacation cutting. In addition, a former school psychologist who now works with a national organization told us about an instance when school officials had suspicions of vacation cutting that was notreported. However, they did not confirm these suspicions with the student or her family, out of concern that she would be pulled out of school and her home environment would be disrupted. Without clear evidence that   had occurred, the officials decided to provide the student with general support for trauma. Statesâ€™ mandatory reporting requirements vary across jurisdictions, are dependent on the relevant facts and circumstances, and would be subject to some level of interpretation bythe reporting official. These factors can make it challenging to determine the appropriate course of action when encountering potential instances or risks of   on minors, The public health establishment â€”  at the federal, state, and county levels â€”  has been reluctant to look for and report on female genital mutilation (FGM) data, just as it has been reluctant to report on the incidence of latent and active tuberculosis (TB) among resettled refugees. An example of this reluctance when it comes to reporting on active TB among refugees is the hidden blockbuster discovered by Breitbart News in January that 1, 565 refugees have been â€œdiagnosed with active TB since 2012, three times more than previously reported. â€ Many state government health departments that report active TB among refugees make the data very difficult to find. Other state government health departments simply fail to fully report active TB among refugees, and many county governments, particularly those in urban areas controlled by Democrats, refuse to comply with the public health reporting requirements of the Refugee Act of 1980, particularly with regards to latent TB. Public data on the incidence of FGM â€”  which occurs almost exclusively among the immigrant population arriving from Africa, the Middle East, and the Near East â€”  is far more difficult to obtain than public data on the incidence of active TB. Every state has had very clear reporting standards about the incidence of active TB among the entire population for well over half a century â€”  in many states for more than a century. Such is not the case with FGM, because the barbaric practice was virtually unknown in the United States until the significant upswing over the past several decades in the arrival of immigrants from countries where it is has been a common practice for centuries. â€œI think itâ€™s more than mere reluctance,â€ an attorney familiar with the refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News about the reluctance of public health officials to obtain and report data on FGM. â€œI think itâ€™s a deliberate, ideological approach of moral equivalency, meaning that just about anything multiculturalism dishes out, should be respected and accepted  â€”   and the PC bureaucracy backs them up,â€ the attorney says. â€œPublic health and medical care in general, is not supposed to be a judgment, and because FGM has been made illegal in the U. S. with individual states even passing their own laws, itâ€™s made it easier for public health departments to opt out of addressing it, leaving it instead to law enforcement agencies,â€ the attorney adds. â€œIf there is any doubt, just look at the annual refugee health reports like the one for Texas that has extensive data about health issues related to arriving refugees they report on STDS but there is nothing about FGM, a condition that for many women who have been mutilated, brings   medical issues,â€ the attorney concludes. The 2014 Refugee Health Report issued by the state of Texas, for instance reports, extensively on the rates of syphilis for refugees over the age of 15, but includes no data on FGM. Refugee health reports for the states of California, Utah, Arizona, Minnesota, Indiana, and Florida follow a similar pattern. The Centers for Disease Controlâ€™s (CDC) guidelines to medical professionals responsible for conducting the initial domestic medical screenings of refugees arriving in the United States for resettlement by the federal government specifically recommend genital examinations, which would clearly identify arriving refugees who are FGM victims. However, a significant number of those screeners may not be following those recommendations, or may delay the examinations indefinitely based on language in the guidelines that states â€œ[i]n refugees who previously experienced trauma (e. g. sexual assault victims) the anal and genital examination may be postponed until the refugee establishes a trusting relationship with a provider. â€ That apparent failure misses key information that could help stop the spread of the barbaric practice in the United States, as adult women arriving in the country who are already victims of FGM are likely to be in family situations where their daughters are at risk of being subjected to the same abuse in this country. Common sense suggests that the PRBâ€™s and CDCâ€™s estimates of the number of girls in the United States at risk for FGM is likely to be very close to the true incidence of FGM in this country today. The public health establishmentâ€™s long record of hiding and obscuring data that accurately reflects the true public health status of immigrants and refugees, however, appears to be one of the major stumbling blocks in identifying and eradicating this barbaric practice in the United States, as is the lack of specificity in the underlying federal and state statutes."
21491,The End of the Office Dress Code - The New York Times,Vanessa Friedman,"Over the weekend an exhibition opened at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Entitled â€œUniformity,â€ it displays 71 pieces from the museumâ€™s collection of (surprise) uniforms, divided into four categories  â€”   military, work, school, sports  â€”   as well as a select group of the fashion looks they influenced, like Geoffrey Beeneâ€™s 1967 sequined football jersey gown and Rei Kawakuboâ€™s 1998 military vest and pleated skirt for Comme des GarÃ§ons. â€œI was interested in the inherent dichotomy between uniforms and fashion,â€ said Emma McClendon, assistant curator of costume, and the organizer of the exhibition, â€œbecause while they should be antithetical to one another  â€”   the first is about conformity, the second about creativity  â€”   they are also deeply interrelated. Itâ€™s ironic. â€ But not as ironic as the fact that the show opens just as a number of recent disputes have underscored a somewhat different, and disruptive, reality. We live in a moment in which the notion of a uniform is increasingly out of fashion, at least when it comes to the implicit codes of professional and public life. Indeed, the museum may be the only place they now make sense. If once upon a time Melanie Griffithâ€™s character in â€œWorking Girlâ€ could manipulate viewersâ€™ assumptions about her job and background simply by swapping leather jackets and minidresses for greige suits, today it would be impossible. â€œWe are in a very murky period,â€ Ms. McClendon said. Just before the museumâ€™s show opened, for example, Britain was momentarily distracted from discussions over Brexit (leaving the European Union) by the news that Nicola Thorp, a temp worker, had been sent home from her receptionist job at PricewaterhouseCoopers for refusing to wear heels, as dictated by the dress code of her agency, Portico. She took her cause public, starting a petition for a parliamentary hearing titled â€œMake it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work. â€ If you get more than 100, 000 signatures, Parliament will consider the petition, and as of Tuesday afternoon she had 140, 712. Almost immediately, ITV, the British television network, conducted a poll on whether employers should be allowed to require women to wear heels social media freaked out and Portico announced it had changed its policy: Flats were now acceptable for women (men, of course, could always wear them). A few days later, sweatergate broke out in the United States when a weather forecaster on   in Los Angeles was handed a gray sweater to cover up a tank dress she was wearing on the air. She said it was a joke, courtesy of her   but Twitter took offense, perceiving it as an attempt to control what women wear. All of this follows famous dress code brouhahas like the UBS scandal of 2010 when the Internet discovered that the Swiss bank had issued a   booklet of guidelines for employee dress that included instructions on shoulder width and underwear shade. Then there was the â€œflat shoeâ€ uproar of 2015, when two women were supposedly barred from the red carpet in Cannes for not wearing heels. (The festival director denied the report on Twitter.) And earlier this year, Kansas State Senator Mitch Holmes was forced to issue a public apology for having included, in his guidelines for the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee, which he chaired, a rule for those appearing before the state panel that read: â€œConferees should be dressed in professional attire. For ladies,   necklines and miniskirts are inappropriate. â€ No such specific guidelines were issued for men. Oops. This did not sit well with many. â€œI have decided to retract the conferee guidelines,â€ he said later in a statement, which also noted, â€œMy failure to clearly specify that all conferees, regardless of gender, should strive to present themselves professionally is unacceptable. â€ The slippery slope may have started as a gentle incline way back in the 1970s, and become a bit steeper during the Casual Friday movement of the 1990s and the success of the Facebook I. P. O. in 2012 with its   billionaires. But today, we are speeding down it at breakneck pace, partly thanks to the   conversation around gender equality, and fluidity. â€œThere has been a dramatic change very recently,â€ said Susan Scafidi, a law professor at Fordham University and founder of the Fashion Law Institute. She noted that last December the New York City Commission on Human Rights announced new guidelines for the municipal human rights law that expressly prohibited â€œenforcing dress codes, uniforms, and grooming standards that impose different requirements based on sex or gender. â€ As a result, no employer may require men to wear ties unless they also require women to wear ties, or ask that heels be worn unless both sexes have to wear them. And though this applies only to â€œofficialâ€ dress codes, the   effect is inevitable. â€œDress is now open to the interpretation of the individual, rather than an institution,â€ Professor Scafidi said. This has created an even greater tension in the more ambiguous areas of office dress, especially as the boundaries between home and work become ever blurrier. â€œThereâ€™s a strain of thought that says an employee represents a company, and thus dress is not about personal expression, but company expression,â€ Professor Scafidi said. â€œBut thereâ€™s a counterargument that believes because we identify so much with our careers, we should be able to be ourselves at work. â€ And that has led to all sorts of complications. One personâ€™s â€œappropriateâ€ can easily be anotherâ€™s â€œdisgraceful,â€ and words like â€œprofessional,â€ when used to describe dress requirements, can seem so vague as to be almost meaningless. Kanye West wearing ripped jeans and a jeweled Balmain jacket at the Met Gala: cool or rude? Julia Roberts at the premiere of â€œMoney Monsterâ€ at Cannes this year in bare feet: red carpet pioneer or a step too far? At The New York Times, Michael Golden, the vice chairman, told me: â€œWe have   jobs and those that are principally internal. We ask employees to dress appropriately for the interactions planned for their day. â€ But that can have broad interpretations. In the newsroom, people show up in everything from   suits to shorts from sneakers and Birkenstocks to platform heels. All of which leaves us where? Confused, mostly. And fast trying to create our own codes, or parse those of the offices around us. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, is on the record as saying he wears the same gray   every day so that he can focus his energy on other decisions. Ms. McClendon acknowledges that she tends to wear â€œall black, pretty much every day, and sculptural shapes  â€”   itâ€™s the museum uniform. â€ Professor Scafidi said, â€œMy business uniform is a black jacket with a fitted,   sheath, classic     pumps, and usually our logo pin  â€”   my equivalent of armor, arms and insignia, respectively. â€ Indeed, according to Ms. McClendon, uniforms evolved for a reason: â€œThey fulfill a need to identify your place in the world,â€ for the wearer and the observer. At least when they are easy to read. And part of the idea behind the F. I. T. show, she said, was to â€œput visitors in the   to consider uniform dressing more broadly, and how it impacts their own lives. â€ In other words, to live an examined life when it comes to your wardrobe and your workplace. Because these issues are only going to get more complicated. â€œWe are moving into an era where personal expression is going to trump the desire to create a corporate identity,â€ Professor Scafidi said. â€œItâ€™s a huge power shift. â€ And it has already begun."

Perhaps no country has been more welcoming of Muslims refugees to their own detriment than Sweden. 
Not only has the country accepted far more of these migrants than they can feasibly handle, but the nation has also bent over backwards to make them comfortable. Things have gotten so out of hand that Christmas lights have now been banned so as not to offend these devout Muslims. 
The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages this year, which means that many towns will have no lights at all for the holiday. 
What a sad time for the native Christians in Sweden. 
To add insult to injury, Speisa called the decision â€œa victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the countryâ€™s Christian traditions.â€ 
Shockingly, even though the onslaught of Islamic culture has wreaked havoc on Swedenâ€™s people and infrastructure, they want to â€œtone downâ€ the Christian influence. How backwards is that?! 
Authorities appear to be trying to sweep the decision under the rug by claiming it is a matter of â€œsafety.â€ 
â€œPoles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,â€ said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. 
Iâ€™m not sure theyâ€™re going to be fooling anyone with this â€œsafetyâ€ line. If they were really so worried about that, they wouldnâ€™t be allowing millions of migrants to roam around raping their women and children. 
MRC Blog expressed the same sentiment: 
This argument that lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk is complete [sic] bogus, of course. Authorities in Sweden actually expect people to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. In reality, these lights have simply been banned to avoid offending Muslim â€œrefugees.â€ 
You can be sure that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we have a future similar to Swedenâ€™s to look forward to. She has privately expressed her desire for completely open borders and she kowtows to Muslims the same way President Obama does. 
SHARE this report if you think it is utterly absurd that Sweden has banned Christmas lights to appease Muslim refugees!"

21494,"Intel to Cut 12,000 Jobs as PC Demand Plummets - The New York Times",Quentin Hardy,"SAN FRANCISCO  â€”   Intel, the worldâ€™s largest maker of semiconductors, said on Tuesday that it was laying off 12, 000 people, about 11 percent of its work force, as it continues to reel from a long downturn in global demand for personal computers. The companyâ€™s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, announced the layoffs as part of a larger corporate restructuring, which will result in a $1. 2 billion charge. Intel also reported      earnings and reduced its projected revenue for the year. â€œIntel has been known as the PC company,â€ Mr. Krzanich said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. â€œItâ€™s time to make this transition and push the company all the way overâ€ to supplying chips for things like smartphones, cloud computing, sensors and other devices. Intelâ€™s restructuring is the latest evidence of how onetime tech bellwethers have had to navigate a rapid shift into the more flexible and dispersed tech world created by the combination of mobile computing devices connected to cloud computing systems. On Monday, for example, IBM reported lower profit and revenue, including a 22 percent drop in sales of computing hardware. Microsoft, which will report its financial results on Thursday, has over the last several years changed its strategy from software in PCs toward computer servers, a mix that involves much more software rented over its giant cloud system. Dell, a big PC maker, took itself private in 2013.   divided into two companies last year, one focused on corporate computing and one that makes PCs and printers. Last September, HP announced about 30, 000 layoffs. At Intel, Mr. Krzanich became chief almost three years ago, and over much of that time he has talked about moving the company into new areas. More recently, top executives have left the company, and Mr. Krzanich has brought in executives from other companies. The new restructuring is intended to help Intel invest more heavily in its new segments, such as chips to power connected devices. Yet Intel still gets 60 percent of its revenue from chips supplied to PCs, and its profit margins there are not as good as in data center chips, its other major business. The companyâ€™s other businesses have small profits, or else lose money. That means PCs are still core to what Intel does. Most of the layoffs, along with things like consolidating facilities and cut projects, are expected to be inside the PC business. Employees who are affected by the restructuring will be notified in the next 60 days, the company said. The layoffs are the largest since 2006, when the company let go 10, 500 employees. Last week, Gartner reported that worldwide PC shipments in the first quarter were 64. 8 million units, down 9. 6 percent from a year ago. â€œThe hope was that PC demand, which has fallen for years, would be flat, and other segments would start filling in,â€ said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner. â€œThis threw a monkey wrench into that. â€ For the first quarter, Intel had net income of $2 billion, or 42 cents a share, and revenue of $13. 7 billion. Wall Street analysts had projected that Intel would earn 47 cents a share on revenue of $13. 8 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Revenue at the PC group fell 14 percent from the previous quarter, indicating Intel had to cut prices as demand fell. Intel faces other potential stumbling blocks. The company is unique as much of the tech industry counts on it continually delivering chips with more transistors for the same money. The process, known as Mooreâ€™s Law after Intel   Gordon Moore, has generally happened in   intervals. The next generation of chips, however, is likely to arrive in two and a half years, or more, leading to fears that Mooreâ€™s Law is slowing. Mr. Krzanich, who previously had played down the significance of his production schedule, took pains on Tuesday to say that Intel wanted to pick up its pace. â€œWe are continuously striving to get back to two years,â€ he said. Intel had better do so, Mr. Hung said. â€œIts competitors donâ€™t seem to be slowing down,â€ he said. â€œThey may get to the next generation of chips at the same time as Intel. That would be  . â€ Besides cutting its operating expenses by $700 million this year through the restructuring, Intel may be seeking to sell different types of chips in combined ways for better efficiency and profit. â€œWeâ€™re moving from a company that was at the center of the PC market to being a company at the center of cloud computing,â€ said Stacy Smith, Intelâ€™s chief financial officer. On Tuesday, Mr. Smith was named to run Intelâ€™s sales, manufacturing and operations, another indication of how Intel needs to tighten its relationship with a few big cloud companies, like Amazon and Microsoft. This would involve integrating the production and sale of things like chips for computer memory along with computer processors. The company also wants to build a business in connecting things like automobiles to cloud computing, and needs to build faster wireless computing technologies for that. Intel added that it would begin a search for a new chief financial officer."
21495,NYT: Populist Steve Bannon Reassures Conservatives Uneasy About Trump,Breitbart News,"The New York Timesâ€™ Jeremy Peters writes that Donald Trumpâ€™s chief strategist Steve Bannon â€œoffered a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activistsâ€ at the annual CPAC conference on Thursday. Bannonâ€™s reputation, Peters writes, â€œhas taken on almost mythic proportion as a   populist, emerging power center, man of mystery. â€[From the New York Times:  [Bannon] urged a ballroom full of activists to stick together against the forces that were trying to tear them apart. â€œWhether youâ€™re a populist, whether youâ€™re a   conservative, whether youâ€™re a libertarian, whether youâ€™re an economic nationalist,â€ he said, â€œwe want you to have our back. â€ Despite Mr. Bannonâ€™s assurances, a simmering unease remains among conservatives over whether Mr. Trump will honor his promises to them, given that he was not part of their movement  â€”   or any political movement, for that matter  â€”   until very recently.

November 2016 Offizieller Friseur des WeiÃŸen Hauses erlitt am Wahlabend Nervenzusammenbruch Washington, D.C. (dpo) - Zu einem tragischen Zwischenfall ist es wÃ¤hrend der US-PrÃ¤sidentschaftswahl am Dienstagabend in Washington gekommen. Wie erst heute bekannt wurde, musste der Friseur des US-PrÃ¤sidenten kurz nach Bekanntgabe der ersten Wahlergebnisse ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert. Die Pressestelle des WeiÃŸen Hauses bestÃ¤tigte den Vorfall. Demnach ging Arthur McMellow, der seit 31 Jahren im Amtssitz des Staatsoberhauptes fÃ¼r den perfekten Look der prÃ¤sidialen Haarpracht zustÃ¤ndig ist, voller Euphorie zu einer Wahlparty in den Keller des WeiÃŸen Hauses, wo auch andere Mitarbeiter den Verlauf der Wahl verfolgten. ""Anfangs war er wie wir alle sehr zuversichtlich und freute sich auf die Nacht"", erinnert sich der Chefkoch des WeiÃŸen Hauses, der ebenfalls anwesend war. ""Arthur hatte sich vorsorglich schon mit Material fÃ¼r blonde StrÃ¤hnchen eingedeckt und war guter Dinge."" Sind es politische Differenzen mit seinem kÃ¼nftigen Chef, die McMellow zu schaffen machten? Als gegen Mitternacht immer klarer wurde, dass Trump auf Obama folgen wÃ¼rde, sei die Stimmung zwar etwas gekippt, ""aber alle BeschÃ¤ftigten des WeiÃŸen Hauses blieben ruhig und professionell"", wie einer der GÃ¤rtner berichtet. ""Nur Arthur wurde immer fahriger und lauter, das ist sonst gar nicht seine Art."" Normalerweise gilt McMellow in seinem Umfeld als sehr ausgeglichener Mensch, der seinen Job liebt und ihn mit Leidenschaft ausfÃ¼llt. Doch der 56-JÃ¤hrige lieÃŸ sich nicht mehr beruhigen: Gegen ein Uhr morgens alarmierte der Leibarzt von PrÃ¤sident Obama den Notruf. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt lag McMellow in FÃ¶tusstellung wimmernd am Boden. Inzwischen liegt er in einem Washingtoner Krankenhaus und befindet sich auf dem Weg der Besserung. Bekannte erklÃ¤rten, McMellow plane, schnellstmÃ¶glich seine Stelle kÃ¼ndigen und in einen nervlich weniger fordernden Job wie etwa LÃ¶wendompteur zu wechseln. pfg; Foto oben: Shutterstock [M]; Foto unten: Michael Vadon , CC BY-SA 4.0 Artikel teilen:"

Schumer is weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. He is a poor leader, and he is leading the Democrats to doom,â€ Trump continued. Trump also criticized Democrats in Congress for opposing his immigration agenda, arguing that â€œIf the Democrats knew what the hell they were doing, they would approve [the wall] so fast, as we want to stop crime in our country. â€ He said: Obviously they donâ€™t mind illegals coming in, they donâ€™t mind drugs pouring in, they donâ€™t mind MS13 coming in.

Or they can vote to help American citizens and American families be safe, thatâ€™s the choice. In March, Sen.

21501,"Bored, Broke and Armed: Clues to Chicagoâ€™s Gang Violence - The New York Times",John Eligon,"CHICAGO  â€”   The young men who call themselves Gangster Disciples skirted by an empty lot. They marched past a â€œStop the Violenceâ€ mural painted on a corner store, coming to a halt when they saw members of a rival gang, the Black Disciples. It was late September on a busy South Side intersection, and now tensions were escalating, gang members who were there recalled. There were glares, they said. Then words. â€œYouâ€™re a rat,â€ a Black Disciple said to one of the Gangster Disciples who he believed had given the police information about him. Things were about to blow. It had been exactly 90 days since some of these same men had sat across from one another in an airy church hall to broker peace and confront a hard truth: The gang war they had inherited and were viciously continuing was helping to unravel parts of this city, where the levels of violence were reaching horrific new heights. With 739 murders as of Wednesday, 2016 has been Chicagoâ€™s deadliest year since 1997. Six fatalities came during Memorial Day weekend, when The New York Times tracked 49 shootings involving 64 victims over three days. One of the shooting survivors from that weekend was a Gangster Disciple known as Mexico, shot in his right leg on May 29 when tensions flared between the same factions that were about to square off in front of the store, New Food Inc. An overwhelming majority of the cityâ€™s 3, 451 shootings this year were   the police say. What that means has become increasingly fuzzy, as the large,   operations built around drug dealing have splintered, and are now little more than cliques or sets. The Times spent several weeks this fall with gang members to get a better understanding of what it means to be in a gang. They were often days of boredom, punctuated by bursts of drama and bravado. Gang life means animated debates over whether the guys on the next block meant to insult you or not. It means worrying over how to make enough for your next meal or your next high. And it means mourning the loss of loved ones, retaliating in their honor, yet wanting the cycle to stop. Ron, a    Black Disciple who uses the nickname Kaos, and for safety reasons asked that his last name not be used, explained the relentless cycle of violence: Iâ€™ve already lost friends. If we are making money, I can ignore the urge to retaliate. â€œBut if weâ€™re sitting here bored, getting high and we got guns around, it ainâ€™t nothing else to do,â€ he added. Still, these are young men who defy easy caricature. They are the sales associates who help you find shoes at a sportswear store or factory workers next to you on the assembly line. They kiss their young children on the lips and cry when someone close to them dies. And, yes, they do use and sell drugs, and sometimes lash out in inexplicable bursts of violence over disputes like a battle for a girlâ€™s attention, or disrespectful words uttered on a rap video posted to YouTube. Or, as was the case in front of the corner store in late September, over an insult hurled on a busy intersection. There was supposed to be a mechanism to stop this from escalating. During the peace talks at Pastor Corey Brooksâ€™s New Beginnings Church in June, the rival factions had brokered a truce. They had agreed to run their disputes up the ladder to gang elders, who would work to quash them. But now things moved fast, said the two gang members who were there. After the insult, the Gangster Disciples left the block, but then returned, and the verbal jabbing continued. Then, the Gangster Disciples claim, the Black Disciple who had called one of them a rat reached into his pocket and pulled out his cellphone, pretending it was a gun. The Black Disciples denied that. Whatever the truth, a Gangster Disciple whipped out a pistol and opened fire, witnesses said. The busy block scattered. And the Black Disciple with the phone was shot in his foot. The truce established in the church hall had been broken. After the shooting, dozens of Black Disciples gathered at their home base: the Parkway Garden Homes, a complex of brick   buildings stretching three blocks along South Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, built in the 1950s to house black   families. Michelle Obama lived there as a toddler. But over time, the   families left, and mostly   families moved in. More than half of the population lives in poverty in Parkway and the surrounding neighborhood, which is 95 percent black. An abandoned Walgreens sits on King Drive, along with cellphone stores and fast food shops that moved in when many businesses picked up and left. Parkway earned a reputation as one of Chicagoâ€™s most violent areas. It was, however, considered a safe zone for the Black Disciples who controlled the complex  â€”   a faction known as Oâ€™Block, named after a fallen ally, Odee Perry. Now they were debating how to respond to the shooting at New Food. Some people wanted to respect the truce, in large part because it allowed them to make money by selling drugs in peace. That was why many had advocated for it in the first place. Others, however, turned to the man who had been shot, Kaos recalled. â€œWeâ€™re with whatever youâ€™re with  â€”   however you feel about it because you got shot,â€ he recalled some people saying. â€œIf you want to push, weâ€™re going to push. â€ Black gangs began sprouting in Chicago in earnest in the 1950s during a second wave of northward migration of black Southerners. The migrants came looking for opportunity, but were crammed into overcrowded, segregated pockets on the cityâ€™s South and West sides where industry and jobs were dwindling. Conditions were ripe for what followed: Boys, with little supervision, money or education, formed cliques. They hung out socially, and got into fights and other petty trouble. The   evolved into extortion of local businesses, much as it did with the existing white ethnic gangs and local mobsters. Then came the heroin and crack epidemics that turned gangs into lucrative   organizations that fought over territory. For a while, though, the gangs in Woodlawn also helped keep calm and avoid riots after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and helped with a federally funded job training program in the area. But those highly organized operations have fizzled over the last 25 years as prosecutors swept up gang leaders, and the city demolished public housing projects, dispersing gang members primarily to minority neighborhoods on the West and South Sides. Now they were everywhere and nowhere  â€”   gangsters by name, but kings only of corners and blocks. And instead of turf and money, they fought over personal slights. Kaos was coy about how Oâ€™Block responded to the shots fired by the Jaro City member at New Food. Violence did, however, continue that week. Two days after the New Food shooting, two Gangster Disciples were shot at night in a   about a block from the store, but people on both sides said that particular shooting was unrelated to the feud. A day later, the two sides clashed again near New Food, firing shots at each other. The mother of a Black Disciple was caught in the crossfire, shot in her left foot. By late that afternoon, Sept. 22, alarm bells were going off at New Beginnings Church. Pastor Brooks huddled with some of the gang elders. The truce seemed to be falling apart. Lavondale Glass, 43, a former Gangster Disciple who was helping to broker peace, saw the young men falling into the dangerous logic of revenge. â€œThis is what I donâ€™t understand with the younger generation,â€ Mr. Glass, who goes by the name Big Dale, told Kaos one day. â€œHow could you honor the dead and not the living?â€ Those who were killed are dead, he said. â€œAinâ€™t no bringing them back. â€ Big Dale had lost his own father, Leon Holton, in 1996  â€”   assassinated in a Gangster Disciple power struggle as federal agents were moving hard against many of the gangâ€™s top lieutenants. His son, who is part of the Jaro City faction, was shot in the hand a few days before the truce was brokered. But there often comes a time when the gang members lucky to make it past their 30s face the damage they have done and want to fix it. Big Dale had reached that point. Pastor Brooks and the elders decided that Big Dale would gather the Gangster Disciples to discuss what was going on, while the Black Disciple old heads would do the same with their side. They would then hold a joint session to determine how to get the peace back on track. But after the Black Disciples spent about an hour shouting at one another in a parking lot behind the church, the elders realized they first needed to resolve an internal rift. It appeared that some in the Oâ€™Block clique were jealous because, while they were broke, their allies from the 63rd Street faction seemed to be making money selling drugs, said a former Black Disciple who described the issue only on the condition of anonymity. The attitude of some of the young men on Oâ€™Block was that if they couldnâ€™t make money, then â€œcanâ€™t nobody get nothing,â€ the former Black Disciple said. â€œWhen they get bored, they do stupid stuff. â€ Boredom is, indeed, a big part of gang life. But boredom mixed with desperation can turn menacing. And that was where several of Kaosâ€™s gang allies found themselves on a chilly night in late October as they slipped on clear Guy Fawkes masks and set upon a man they saw walking by himself along King Drive. They were broke, and this is what they were going to do about it. When Kaos was growing up, gang life seemed like anything but a thrifty, desperate existence. Living with his mother in the Robert Taylor Homes, a sprawling and notorious housing project just south of downtown, he saw the closets stuffed with plastic Aldi bags of cash, stashed by Gangster Disciples, he said. He moved away when the projects were demolished, and stayed with his grandmother in Black Disciples territory. By his early teens, he was found to have an impulsive behavior disorder, he said. He became deeply immersed in the Black Disciples after a friend was killed by a rival of the gang. At around 13, he said, he faced his first serious charges: attempted murder, which landed him in juvenile jail. He was charged with three gun felonies as an adult, but earned a G. E. D. in prison, he said. He spent two semesters in cooking school but dropped out in part because it was in rival gang territory and was dangerous, he said. He has managed to make enough money selling drugs to pose as something of a high roller. Tall with blond dreadlocks often hidden beneath a safari hat, Kaos wears Balmain jeans that cost hundreds of dollars, a Versace belt and a glittering wristwatch. But on this October day, his flashy trappings were mostly for show because he had gone several months without selling drugs, he said. Good product was hard to come by. He hung out in an apartment he shared with a girlfriend, and some friends stopped by. They all lamented the same problem: They had no money. For some, there was admittedly a lack of motivation to  . For others, criminal records got in the way. Kaos said he had been turned away by Walmart, Walgreens, Footlocker and others. One in four adults in this neighborhood has not graduated from high school, and the unemployment rate is 33 percent, two and a half times the citywide rate. Even when Kaos landed a job, there were complications getting there. Riding public transportation can make gang members easy targets for rivals. But the alternatives are tough, too: Kaos had recently gotten a job with a company baking pastries for international flights, but he quit after three days because he wouldnâ€™t be paid until after his second week, he said, and he didnâ€™t have gas money to get to work. And in a neighborhood where people haggle over dollar bills, he did not have anyone to borrow money from. As darkness fell, Kaos said he peeked out of the window and saw about 10 gang allies slipping on the Guy Fawkes masks. A few minutes later, one knocked on his door, Kaos said. He and some of the younger gang members had tried to rob a man, he told Kaos. But the man pulled a pistol, shot one of them in the leg and ran off. An ambulance carted away the wounded man. His friends lingered in the courtyard, laughing about the fiasco. Inside, Kaos shook his head. â€œI donâ€™t know what they were thinking,â€ he said, injecting a curse word. He later lamented, â€œIt only takes one to push a crowd. â€ Now there were fresh worries: The man they tried to rob could belong to a gang, meaning they may have incited a battle with an unknown clique, Kaos said. And if that guy wanted to retaliate, he had the element of surprise on his side because no one got a good look at his face. Retaliation is a universal worry of gang members. So it was in the rival Jaro City, which had been in a state of alert since the New Food shooting weeks earlier. The clique worried that the war was about to flare again, said Antwine White, 24, a Gangster Disciple who is called Weedy. â€œYou just get prepared for the worst,â€ he said. â€œThey can walk over here. We can think itâ€™s cool. They shoot. â€ That defines    gang life in Chicago. The young men bound around with their chests out, but their heads are on constant swivels, eyeing everything around them. Itâ€™s why the gang members here engage in their own sort of profiling: People with dreadlocks and hoodies, especially those they have never seen before, draw more scrutiny. And so, weeks after the convenience store shooting, when peace seemed to have been restored, a passionate discussion about politics and revolution between Weedy and his gang allies broke up at the sight of an unfamiliar face: a man in a red hoodie. â€œSteady walking back and forth on the corner, right here in front of Rothschild,â€ a fellow Gangster Disciple said, referring to a liquor store about 100 yards from where they were standing. A couple of the Gangster Disciples hustled over to check him out. But Weedy hung back. Here he was, caught in a middle ground of ambivalence. Am I in the gang or out? How can I leave when most of my friends are still in it? Or when I still need to rely on it to make a few dollars? Weedy grew up on the block. His father was a prominent Gangster Disciple. His fatherâ€™s friends would get a kick out of it whenever they reached for Weedyâ€™s hand and he would mimic the gang handshake. He relished the attention. But as he got older, he yearned for a deeper relationship with his father. There was no fatherly slap on the back or shoes promised to him for making the honor roll. His father, who Weedy said had a drinking problem, would arrange to pick him up from his motherâ€™s house, but he would sit there until 2 a. m. waiting. â€œOnce I got immune to him lying, it was a wrap,â€ Weedy said. â€œMy trust, that bond with him wasnâ€™t there no more. â€ So when he got into fights at school, when he needed information or wanted help solving problems, Weedy did not call his father. He turned to his friends on the block. The streets became even more appealing after a popular Gangster Disciple, Jarvis Smith, 22, was killed 11 years ago, drawing everyone in the neighborhood closer. Weedy started selling drugs and gambling. He wasnâ€™t a gunman himself, he said, but he would put up money to buy guns. All seemed well until June 2, 2014, when he was headed to his job at a sportswear store downtown. Weedy would take the elevated train, but the closest stop was near rival turf, so he used one farther away in the other direction. As he walked toward the stop, he felt a shock pulse through his body. He fell. On the ground, he said, he looked over his shoulder and saw a man firing a gun about 20 yards away. Weedy had been shot twice before, but those were relatively minor injuries. This was serious. â€œI thought he was going to run up, stand over me,â€ Weedy said. â€œI thought it was over. â€ His son was then only about six months old and it pained him, he said, to think the boy would grow up without a father. But the shooter never rushed up for the kill. After that, Weedy started thinking differently, he said. He resolved to reconcile with his father. He would recommit to leading his son in a better direction. And he told his friends not to seek revenge. â€œIâ€™m covered in the blood of Jesus,â€ he told them. But leaving gang life is not simple. For one, just because you say youâ€™re out of the gang doesnâ€™t mean your rivals see it that way. On that afternoon, while his friends marched over to see if the man in the red hoodie was a threat, Weedy hung back. His allies would learn that the young man was, indeed, a rivalâ€™s relative. But he was not doing anything threatening, so they let it go. Weedy leaned on a black iron gate, looking on from afar. â€œEven if it was an opp, he can go to the store,â€ Weedy said, using the slang term for a rival. â€œWe go to their store. Whatâ€™s the problem? You got to play fair. â€ He has not fully extricated himself from gang life, and may never do so. But here he was, no stranger himself to gunplay, questioning not just the scene playing out before him, but his own life. It was a delicate dance, Weedy said. Approach an opp aggressively and he might shoot you. Or youâ€™re the one with the gun. â€œHe talk crazy, you shoot him,â€ he said. â€œYou go to jail, you get killed. Itâ€™s  . For what?â€"
21502,The Loophole That Could Cost Donald Trump the Nomination - The New York Times,Nate Cohn,"Pennsylvania, which holds its primary next Tuesday, uses a nonbinding â€œloopholeâ€ primary  â€”   and that could cost Donald Trump the Republican nomination. If the state adopted the delegate rules of any other primary, he would probably be an   favorite, or better, to amass the 1, 237 delegates needed before the convention. Instead, his chances may come down to the whims of 54 unpledged Pennsylvania delegates. No other state leaves so many of its delegates unbound  â€”   allowed to vote for whomever they please at the convention. Thatâ€™s because it conducts its loophole primary in two parts. First is the â€œbeauty contest,â€ which is a presidential primary preference vote. The winner of the beauty contest gets all of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s 17   and bonus delegates. But the remaining 54  â€”   the three delegates awarded to each congressional district  â€”   are unbound and elected in the delegate selection primary. In this part, voters directly elect delegates to the national convention. What makes Pennsylvaniaâ€™s G. O. P. delegate selection primary so distinctive is that the ballot includes no guidance on whom a delegate will support at the national convention (the prospective Democratic delegates commit to a candidate). A voter will just see a list of names  â€”   some of whom might be recognizable, but others might as well be Joe Schmo. (Itâ€™s called a loophole primary because it could circumvent the delegate allocation rules. Voters could, in theory, elect a slate of delegates who unanimously support one candidate, even in cases where a    contest was prohibited.) The result is that Pennsylvania, with the   G. O. P. delegates of any state, ranks 49th in pledged delegates. Itâ€™s behind even Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. The other two states with loophole primaries  â€”   West Virginia and Illinois  â€”   take a somewhat different approach: The delegates pledge whom theyâ€™ll support, and their preferences are listed alongside their names on the ballot. When you read articles about whether Mr. Trump can reach 1, 237 pledged delegates by the convention, these 54 delegates are held out of the analysis. Mr. Trump would be favored to win a majority of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s 71 delegates under any other primary system. He leads by at least nine percentage points in every survey in the state, and is ahead of Ted Cruz by an average of 44 percent to 28 percent, according to The Huffington Post Pollster. Heâ€™s up by a similar margin of 46 percent to 30 percent in The Upshotâ€™s   model. Our model gives him an edge in 15 of the stateâ€™s 18 congressional districts. In a standard proportional allocation, Mr. Trump would probably be on track to win at least 40 of the stateâ€™s delegates. In a    system, like Indianaâ€™s or Californiaâ€™s, Mr. Trump would be favored to win at least 60 delegates. The difference matters a lot because Mr. Trumpâ€™s prize of 1, 237 hangs on a thread. He is probably on track to finish a bit short of 1, 237. Our model puts his projected delegate deficit as slightly less than the number of delegates left unpledged (54) in Pennsylvania, meaning he would be projected to win if they were bound delegates. Although facing a challenge in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump has benefited from other quirks in the Republican primary rules. Compared with the Democratsâ€™ rules, the Republican ones are far more favorable to a candidate who wins with a plurality of the vote. And with the race as close as it is, any number of tweaks in the rules could make Mr. Trump a clear favorite  â€”   or an overwhelming underdog."
21503,"Keith Ellison as DNC Chair: Another High Place, Another Empty Black Face",Bruce A. Dixon,"Tweet Widget A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon 
In a decade on the House Financial Services Committee Keith Ellison hasnâ€™t targeted the credit card racketeers, or the banksters who flooded the market with predatory home and student loans or federal officials who refuse to relieve underwater homeowners. Democratic party leaders need another empty black face to front the DNC, someone who blames Wikileaks and the Russians for Hillaryâ€™s defeat. Ellison will do just fine. Keith Ellison as DNC Chair: Another High Place, Another Empty Black Face A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by BAR managing editor Bruce A. Dixon 
In the wake of Donald Trumpâ€™s election, Democratic party honchos are scrambling to reassure their funders and to shore up the careers of Democratic elected officials who serve those funders. They must justify and retain whatever hold they still have on the millions of nominal Democratic voters who actually have no voice whatsoever in what their party stands for. 
At bottom, the two capitalist parties are owned by the same class of elite one percenter funders but with different voting bases At least one US party is always the self-declared White Manâ€™s Party. Since the late sixties Republicans have reserved that slot for themselves, leaving Democrats to claim the allegiance of racial minorities and some other groups. The different voting bases of the two parties mean they have different campaign styles, but when the campaigns are over theyâ€™re both as Barack Obama affirmed, on the same team. Both parties deliver the mandate of their constituencies to their common funders, Big Ag, Big Oil, Big Insurance, Big Pharma, Big Real Estate, the military contractors and Wall Street. 
After the departures of Debbie Wasserman-Schulz and Donna Brazile, both deeply implicated in the sabotaging of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clintonâ€™s loss, Democrats need a new face at the head of the Democratic National Committee, the national partyâ€™s executive body. Ideally it should be someone who reassures the funders and can help rally the base voters. The leading contender is Keith Ellison, just elected to his sixth term in Congress from Minneapolis. 
Keith Ellison seems a good fit. He was the first Muslim ever elected to Congress, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and current co-chair of the large and virtually impotent House Progressive Caucus. He was an early endorser of Bernie Sanders who did his duty trying to lead leftward strays back into Hillaryâ€™s big tent . In a decade on the House Financial Services Committee, Ellison managed not to deeply offend the banksters who flooded the market with predatory housing and student loans, or the payday lenders and credit card racketeers, and he didnâ€™t embarrass or insult the colleagues who openly shill for them. In that target rich environment Ellison managed not just to keep from hitting anything, but not even to take aim. 
By contrast, Senator Elizabeth Warren in 2014 made headlines when she grilled Ellison's former Congressional Black Caucus colleague Mel Watt , on why the agency he heads, despite a clear mandate from Congress to reduce the principals on potentially millions of unpayable predatory home loans, refused to reduce the principal on a single one. Three years later the news is that the agency may reduce principal on a mere 3,100 home loans at most . Weâ€™re still waiting to hear from Ellison and the other eight black Democrats on the committee on this failure. 
But Ellison is black. Heâ€™s the first Muslim elected to Congress, heâ€™s smart enough and telegenic. He votes infallibly to support the apartheid regime in Israel, and he says if it were up to him thereâ€™d have been a no-fly zone (and possible shooting war with the Russians) a long time ago. 
Hillaryâ€™s indispensable firewall was supposed to be the black vote, for which she needed to do little else than mumble about â€œblack lives matteringâ€ and pose occasionally with the mothers of some of those murdered by police. Democratic shot callers seem to still believe that all they need is another empty black face in a high place. They wonâ€™t get another First Black President. It was Hillaryâ€™s turn and that didnâ€™t work out. Now itâ€™s Keith Ellisonâ€™s another empty black face in a very high place.

21504,Election Heats Up: Kerry Heads To The Polesâ€¦In ANTARCTICA WTF,Rachel Blevins,"We Are Change 

While many Americans headed to the polls to vote in the 2016 election on Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry traveled toâ€¦ Antarctica.
Kerryâ€™s trip will include a visit to the McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole stations, which will make him the first Secretary of State to visit Antarctica, according to a press release from the National Science Foundation.
It comes at a curious time, given the ongoing election. When asked about the timing, State Department spokesman John Kirby insisted that its purpose is â€œto talk to researchers and scientists largely about climate change research.â€ 
A reporter responded by questioning the legitimacy of the trip, noting, â€œThereâ€™s some criticism that this trip is basically, you know, the Secretary wants to knock Antarctica off his bucket list and heâ€™s doing it on taxpayer expense.â€ 
Kirby insisted that it is important for Kerry â€œto see firsthand what we are learning about the environment down there on the South Pole.â€ 
â€œAs an individual who has literally championed climate change research and awareness for decades now, the secretary is and will remain committed to increasing the awareness and education of the public about this,â€ Kirby said.

The location of Kerryâ€™s trip is also interesting. Russian scientists drew criticism in 2012 for drilling into Antarcticaâ€™s â€œAlienâ€ Lake Vostok, which scientists claim went â€œundisturbed by sunlight for over 15 million years.â€ 
Theories as to what is under the surface of the lakeâ€”which is considered the sixth largest in the worldâ€” include oil, a secret Nazi base with Hitlerâ€™s remains, nuclear energy, Atlantis, and of course, a UFO landing site.
Kerryâ€™s trip will add to his lead as the Secretary of State who has traveled the most miles, with over 1.3 million since 2013. This sends him even further ahead former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who traveled 956,733 miles from 2009 to 2013.
In addition to staying away from the polls in the U.S. where he would be expected to vote for Clinton, Kerry is also showing her up by reminding the world that he beat her in total miles traveledâ€”an area where Clinton was very competitive.
In 2010, Clinton wrote an email to her top aide Huma Abedin asking , â€œWhatâ€™s my total now?â€ 
â€œWe have 36 trips to date,â€ Abedin responded, noting that Clinton needed at least four more to beat the record of 1.06 million set by Condoleezza Rice.

21506,2006 Audio Captures Hillary Clinton Proposing To Rig Palestine Election,Carol Adl,"  Carol Adl in Middle East , News , US // 0 Comments 
Hillary Clinton proposed rigging the Palestinian parliamentary elections while she was a US senator in 2006, according to a newly emerged recording. 
The decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Hillary Clinton saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. 
The US Democratic presidential nominee lamented that the US didnâ€™t â€œdetermine who was going to win.â€ 
The result of that election was a victory for the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas over the US-favored Fatah political party. 
RT reports: 
â€œI do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,â€ then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election. 
â€œAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win,â€ she said. 
Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspaperâ€™s office in Brooklyn. 
Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. 
Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that â€œanyone could support the idea â€” offered by a national political leader, no less â€” that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.â€ 
The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. 
Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the â€œpower of democracy,â€ but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israelâ€™s existence and espoused violence. 
That day in September 2006, Clinton made â€œodd and controversial comments,â€ all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky â€œheld onto all these years.â€ 
â€œI went to my bosses at the time,â€ Chomsky told the Observer. â€œThe Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody â€” even a direct quote from anyone â€” in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didnâ€™t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.â€ 
The latest revelation comes after repeated accusations by the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump who says that the media and the political establishment have rigged the 2016 election against him. 
It would seem that the crooked Mrs Clinton thinks nothing of rigging any election to suit her agenda."
21507,Poll: Majority of Americans Want Merit-Based Immigration,John Binder,"A new survey shows widespread support for President Donald Trumpâ€™s plan to swap current U. S. immigration policy, based on   toward entry based on skills and merit. [In a Rasmussen Reports poll, 44 percent of likely American voters want to move to a   immigration system that only admits legal immigrants if their skills are needed in the U. S.  Only 37 percent of likely voters want to keep the current legal immigration system which is based solely on family chain migration. Another 18 percent of likely voters said they did not know which system they would prefer. Men, as well as younger likely voters, much prefer a   immigration system, with 51 percent saying they would like to see a switch, as opposed to 38 percent of women. Voters between the ages 18 to 30 favored a merit system by 49 percent. Voters from 40 to 64 preferred the status quo by 43 percent. While Trumpâ€™s   plan is wildly popular with 60 percent of Republicans, likely voters who do not identify with either of the two major political parties show 47 percent support as well. The poll also found that Americans continue to support deportations of illegal immigrants, even if the illegal immigrant has a child in the U. S.   percent of likely voters said illegal immigrants with children born in the U. S. should not be exempt from deportation. Only 37 percent disagreed. Across party lines, deportations of illegal immigrants with children remains popular, with 62 percent of Republicans supporting the action, along with 30 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of American voters who are not affiliated with either major political party.

21508,Shock: Colin Kaepernick Cares More About Protesting Than He Does About Football - Breitbart,Dylan Gwinn,"The sports media is just now learning what was apparent to conservatives and Republicans all last season: that Colin Kaepernick cares an awful lot more about politics than he does about football. [Peter King, from the Monday Morning Quarterback, spent the weekend of the NFL draft with the San Francisco 49ers. During that time, a time spent in close quarters with many of the 49ers staff, King came away with the distinct impression that many in the building felt Kaepernick would rather protest than play football.  King wrote, â€œI spent a long draft weekend with the Niners in California and there are those in the building who think Kaepernick might actually rather do social justice work   than play quarterback. â€ King cites Kaepernickâ€™s frequent tweeting about social justice and the Know Your Rights Camps, which the former 49er QB began somewhat recently. However, King also brought up Manhattan, where Kaepernick lives, and his wife Nessa, a DJ in New York City. King explains, â€œHe emerges in New York City occasionally for noble cause work, last week donating 100 menâ€™s suits to a parole office in Queens, so recipients, recently out of prison, would look more presentable when going on job interviews. I havenâ€™t talked to Kaepernick, so I have no idea what his gut is telling him about what to do with his life. But itâ€™s crazy that a quarterback who four years ago was coming off a Super Bowl appearance and looked to be a   answer has no team now and no hot NFL prospects that anyone can see. â€ Whatâ€™s crazier, is that Kaepernickâ€™s true priorities and passions are apparently news to the sports media. Playing quarterback in the NFL has no equal in sports in terms of difficulty and complexity. Itâ€™s literally the hardest thing anyone could do in sports, requiring complete and total concentration and channeling of focus. Yet, after the media turned his protest into the biggest story in sports, certain to engulf him, his team, and obscure everything they would attempt to accomplish on the field, what did Kaepernick do? Did he stop, for the benefit of the team? No, he wore a Fidel Castro   to a press conference. How could anyone have seen this and come away with the conclusion that Kaepernick was putting football first? The sports media wanted so badly for Kaepernick to turn into a permanent statue of protest on television screens every Sunday throughout America, that they forgot all about the fact that you have to actually play really well in order to keep a job in the NFL. In fact, especially if you plan on insulting the flag and all who fought and died for it, you have to play exceedingly great. Kaepernick, obviously, did not play great, partially due to the fact that heâ€™s never refined and evolved his game to counter defenses who have figured him out. But, in equal part, due to the fact that he was too busy buying pig socks. Itâ€™s still my opinion that Kaepernick will get signed at some point midseason. But, until then, the media will continue to have a sad about their protest puppet, and what might have been. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"
21509,Poll: 21% of American Voters Approve of Republican Healthcare Plan,Sean Moran,"A recent Quinnipiac poll reveals that only 21 percent of American voters support the Republican healthcare plan, a slight raise from 17 percent in March. [Overall, 56 percent of U. S. voters oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Nearly   of white, Republican college graduates support President Donald Trumpâ€™s actions on health care.    percent of voters believe that health insurance costs will increase, 11 percent of voters believe that costs will decrease, and 37 percent of voters believe that health premiums will remain the same. Americans also approve,   percent, of the current Obamacare statute that prevents health insurers from raising health premiums for patients with   conditions. Congressman Tom MacArthur ( ) who was heavily involved in drafting the AHCA, told Breitbart News that the new healthcare law also protects Americans with   conditions. MacArthur explained: The other side has spent too much time speaking to peopleâ€™s emotions and misstating the facts.   For example, with   conditions the bill could not be more explicit that insurers cannot discriminate, they canâ€™t deny coverage, they canâ€™t deny renewals, they canâ€™t health rate someone whoâ€™s sick in the middle of being insured. If you get sick, your health rates donâ€™t skyrocket. What it does say is that if you donâ€™t maintain coverage for more than 63 days, you will pay an extra premium. However, states can request a waiver to look at those people, but they have to create a risk pool to ensure that the neediest amongst are not left behind. It balances to make sure people donâ€™t skip out on buying health insurance when they get sick. Thatâ€™s not fair to the rest of the American people. Voters believe,   percent, including   percent of Republicans, that it is a â€œbad ideaâ€ to give states the ability to waive certain Obamacare regulations that might reduce the cost of premiums. The question that begins, â€œDo you think that giving states the ability to decide whether or not to allow health insurance companies to raise insurance rates for Americans with   conditions?â€ however, might influence the votersâ€™ answers.   percent of Americans believe that it is â€œvery importantâ€ or â€œsomewhat importantâ€ that all Americans can afford health care. The opposition to the American Health Care Act may surprise voters, although the sample for the poll favors Democrats and independents: Registered Voters Party Identification: The 11 percent gap between Republicans compared to either Democrats or independents might skew the polling data towards those who might want to retain, rather than reform, Obamacare. Tim Malloy, the pollâ€™s assistant director, said in a press release, â€œRepublicans gave up on their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare when a March 23 Quinnipiac University poll showed 17 percent of American voters supported their bill. â€ â€œThe second attempt wins the support of 21 percent of voters,â€ Malloy added. â€œThe grim diagnosis from voters: Health care will cost more and deliver less. â€ Read the poll results here."
21510,Steve Kingâ€™s Iowa Voters Rethink Their Support: â€˜Way Out of Lineâ€™ - The New York Times,Trip Gabriel,"ORANGE CITY, Iowa  â€”   A year ago, Evan Wielenga, 40, believed  â€”   as does his congressman, Steve King  â€”   that undocumented immigrants should all be deported. They broke the law to enter the country. They spoke little English. They strained schools and public services. But as talk of a border wall and a Muslim ban overtook the presidential campaign, Mr. Wielenga, the agronomy manager of a farmersâ€™   here in northwestern Iowa, had a change of heart. He heard dairy farmers say they couldnâ€™t get their cows milked without immigrants. â€œYou can put an ad in the paper and you wonâ€™t get two white guys to apply,â€ said Mr. Wielenga, who grew up on a dairy farm himself. He heard of the ruinous damage an immigration raid had done to families. â€œSome of these kids were born in the U. S.,â€ he said. â€œThese families had lived here 10 years, and all of a sudden, Dadâ€™s gone, Momâ€™s gone. When you think of it from that perspective, whatâ€™s the lesser of two evils?â€ Mr. King, a Republican who has displayed a Confederate battle flag on his desk in Washington, shows no sign of budging in his views. His latest   tirade  â€”   â€œWe canâ€™t restore our civilization with somebody elseâ€™s babies,â€ he said  â€”   once again drew wide condemnation and critical attention to Iowaâ€™s Fourth Congressional District, whose voters overwhelmingly   him to an eighth term in November. Sioux County, Mr. Wielengaâ€™s home, provided the largest margin in the   district, Iowaâ€™s most conservative. And there is no shortage of voters who echo Mr. Kingâ€™s contention that â€œculture and demographics are our destiny,â€ as he said earlier this month to cheers from white supremacists. But in conversations over four days with residents who voted for Mr. King, a new chorus of earnest naysayers could also be heard in many corners of the district. Some said the congressmanâ€™s latest provocation  â€”   uttered in support of a   Dutch politician  â€”   was finally more than they could brook. Several said they were rethinking their support. â€œIâ€™ve always voted for him, but I think this was way out of line,â€ said Bill Kooi, a retired farmer, sipping coffee at a Hardees in Orange City, as the friends who shared his table  â€”   to a man, older white conservatives  â€”   all nodded. Again and again, voters brought up how much Mr. Kingâ€™s district has changed since his election 15 years ago. Though still overwhelmingly white, it has absorbed a sizable population of Hispanics who have taken    jobs and opened small businesses in the empty storefronts of struggling towns. As a generation of   white children leaves for college and seldom returns, immigrants are keeping many of those communities alive. Denison, in Crawford County, is one. Eric Skoog, a county commissioner and owner of Cronkâ€™s restaurant in Denison, where Mr. King, 67, sometimes stops on his way home, said the community had been successfully assimilating a steady stream of Hispanics for years. â€œOne of our claims to fame is we donâ€™t have a Hispanic neighborhood,â€ Mr. Skoog said. Rather, immigrants and their families live throughout the community. Before the 2010 census, city officials worked hard to persuade immigrants to allow themselves to be counted so Denison could receive its share of federal dollars. Mr. Skoog said that Latino newcomers had flocked to Denison to take jobs in meatpacking plants that Iowa farmers had once filled  â€”   but that those native Iowans wanted better for their children. â€œThe next generation, there was not a supply of male white farmers around here,â€ he said. â€œSo all of a sudden you saw the influx of the Hispanic population. â€ Mr. Skoog counts himself a friend of Mr. Kingâ€™s, but offered no explanation for the lawmakerâ€™s   and racially inflammatory statements, which go back years, including a 2013 description of undocumented teenagers with â€œcalves the size of cantaloupesâ€ from carrying drugs across the border. Selecting his words carefully, Mr. Skoog said of Mr. King: â€œThereâ€™s a personal relationship there. I donâ€™t want to damage that by saying too much negative. â€ Others describe an ethos that is changing day by day. Libbie Schillerberg has three children in the Denison schools, where more than half the students are Hispanic. Her oldest, Ethan, 15, plays guitar in a high school mariachi band. Her youngest, Addison, 6, is one of four   whites in her class. â€œIâ€™m on our youth soccer board,â€ Ms. Schillerberg said. â€œWe didnâ€™t used to see as many Hispanic parents volunteering to coach. Weâ€™re seeing more and more. When your kids are such good friends at school, people are getting to know each other better. Theyâ€™re trusting each other, wanting to be around each other. â€ Mario Flores, a   loan officer at Bank Iowa in Denison, said Hispanics there were buying homes, investing in apartment buildings and otherwise injecting economic vitality into the community. â€œI believe both groups, the Anglo and   are learning from each other,â€ he said. Mr. King has survived past denunciations: Last year, he drew a rare primary challenger, who accused him of being so toxic that his name on a  bill rendered it â€œdead on arrival. â€ But Mr. King won easily and went on to crush his Democratic opponent, Kim Weaver, an advocate for the elderly. Over the weekend, Ms. Weaver, who received a small gusher of donations after Mr. Kingâ€™s latest remarks, announced she would challenge him again in 2018. It will not be easy. Last summer, Douglas Burns, an owner of The Times Herald in Carroll, Iowa, headlined a column: â€œKing could use   daily, still get   here. â€ Mr. Burns has branded Mr. King as a racist, but he recoiled from calling the districtâ€™s voters bigoted. Rather, he said in an interview, they embraced Mr. King for blackening the eyes of Washington and Des Moines elites. â€œI think people feel condescended to so much from urban forces that, while they may not like the racist tactics that King uses, if forced to choose sides, theyâ€™re going with King,â€ Mr. Burns said. But there are plenty who donâ€™t seem to quibble much with Mr. Kingâ€™s way of thinking. Sitting at the Hardees in Orange City last week, Don Engeltjes, 76, said he agreed with Mr. King on the need to clamp down on immigration. He said he believed new arrivals were a drain on taxpayersâ€™ money, lumping immigrants from Mexico in with those from the Muslim world. â€œItâ€™s just handout, handout, handout,â€ he said. â€œBut Don, your dad is an immigrant too,â€ another man piped up, noting that Mr. Engeltjesâ€™s father, like many forebears of the districtâ€™s voters, had come over from Holland at age 9. â€œYou bet he was,â€ Mr. Engeltjes replied. â€œBut the way itâ€™s going nowadays, man, theyâ€™re outproducing us. Weâ€™re going to be the minority in a few years. â€ Asked by a reporter who he meant by â€œwe,â€ Mr. Engeltjes said: â€œThe white people. The American people. â€ Mr. Engeltjes said he did not oppose all immigrants. He described a successful prostate procedure he had not long ago in Sioux Falls, S. D. performed by a Korean doctor. But he complained that homes occupied by several Hispanic families living together were running down his neighborhood. On Sundays, he said, he picks up trash in the street from parties he believes are held by his Hispanic neighbors. Interviewed at his home later, where his wife, Alma, said her husband had occasionally made enemies by being outspoken, Mr. Engeltjes praised the same quality in Mr. King, for whom he said he would vote again. â€œEnough of this â€ he said. â€œThe manâ€™s got a pair. â€ Mr. Wielenga, the agronomist, suggested that northwestern Iowa, with its proud Dutch heritage, may have grown too insular, too complacent, during Mr. Kingâ€™s tenure in Congress. He called it a safe community and a great place to raise children. He has four daughters and is the board president of Hull Christian School, where Mr. Wielenga said only one of the 100 families who send children to the private school is Hispanic. He said some of the areaâ€™s churches were entirely white. â€œWe talk about this at school,â€ Mr. Wielenga said: â€œAre we living in a bubble? And is that what God is calling us to do  â€”   to live in a bubble?â€ â€œThis has been going on now for 20 years,â€ he said of the Hispanic influx. â€œNow you want to fix it by kicking people out?â€ He gently shook his head."
21512,Suicide Bombing in Baghdad Kills at Least 36 - The New York Times,The Associated Press,"BAGHDAD  â€”   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   Iraqâ€™s prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborersâ€™ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomberâ€™s vehicle, trying to get hired. â€œThen a big boom came, sending them up into the air,â€ said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed â€œthe most ineffective security forces in the worldâ€ for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capitalâ€™s six million residents. â€œWe have no idea who will kill at any moment and whoâ€™s supposed to protect us,â€ said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. â€œIf the securities forces canâ€™t protect us, then allow us to do the job. â€ Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a â€œ  incident,â€ without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group."
21513,"With Attention on Dakota, Obama Quietly Approves Two New Pipelines",nan,"161402 SHARES 
While the U.S. Department of Justice temporarily halted construction of a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline, two other pipelines are moving forward. 
In May, the Obama administration granted the permits for both the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines, and while construction has not yet begun on the pipelines, implementation plans for the building of the pipelines is well underway. 
Earlier this week, DeSmogBlog investigative reporter Steve Horn highlighted the approval and pending construction of both pipelines, as well as their significant impact on local water supplies and indigenous territory. As Horn wrote, the Trans-Pecos pipeline will carry natural gas extracted from the Permian Basin in West Texas, and transport it across international borders to Mexico. 
According to the Texas Tribune, the 42-inch-wide Trans-Pecos Pipeline will carry 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas every day under the Rio Grande River. Should a leak or spill occur, the effects could be felt in both Texas and Mexico. The Comanche Trail pipeline, which is also 42-inches, will carry gas from the Waha Hub in the Northern part of Pecos County, Texas, to San Elizario, Texas, where it will then be carried across the United States/Mexico border . 
â€œ[The] Trans-Pecos and Comanche go through the Big Bend area, a rural area containing mountains, desert, and ranch land. Most importantly, they link to a massive set of pipelines in Mexico that are in the process of being built and itâ€™s a bit difficult to say what the impacts of land/spills would be there,â€ Horn told US Uncut. â€œWhat sorts of environmental/ecological reviews are being done in Mexico? What are the potential risks of spills there and would we even hear about them if they took place?â€ 
However, Horn says the â€œelephant in the roomâ€ on assessing environmental impact is the fracking being done to take natural gas out of Texasâ€™ Permian Basin. 
â€œWith temperature records being broken left and right, thatâ€™s what the conversation should really center around,â€ Horn said. 
According to the latest status report filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) earlier this month by pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners (the company also building the Dakota Access Pipeline), construction has not yet begun. However, because the pipeline has already been granted approval by both the United States and Mexican governments, Horn says the only recourse left for activists is civil disobedience. 
â€œDakota Access, and everything that preceded the now-ongoing civil disobedience and largest convening of Native American tribes in modern history, shows the regulatory system is designed as a corporate rubber-stamp process,â€ Horn said. â€œThe courts are happy to ratify rulings based on laws written by and for Corporate America.â€ 
Horn credited the Native American tribes chaining their bodies to pipeline construction equipment in North Dakota with the Obama administrationâ€™s recent call to temporarily halt Dakota Access Pipeline construction near the Missouri River. 
â€œ[Civil disobedience] might be the only option left given how much the deck is stacked in favor powerful big business interests in the US regulatory and legislative system.â€

21514,Trump Calls for Closer Relationship Between U.S. and Russia - The New York Times,Nicholas Fandos,"WASHINGTON  â€”   A day after the release of a damning intelligence report on Russiaâ€™s   efforts to influence the American election,   Donald J. Trump called on Saturday for a closer relationship between the two nations, saying only â€œstupidâ€ people or â€œfoolsâ€ would think this was unwise. The United States, Mr. Trump wrote in a series of Twitter messages Saturday morning, has â€œenough problems around the world without yet another one. â€ He pledged that Russia would â€œrespect us far more than they do nowâ€ after he is sworn in as president, and said that the two nations could perhaps work together on the international stage. For years, Russia has been anything but a willing partner of the United States. Relations became strained well before the   cyberattacks began nearly a year and a half ago, despite the Obama administrationâ€™s early effort to reset relations. After Russiaâ€™s intrusion into Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States and its allies levied broad sanctions against the Russian economy and blacklisted dozens of its citizens, including some close to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. President Obama added to those measures last month in retaliation for the hacking, expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on two Russian intelligence services. Russia and the United States have also often been at odds over Moscowâ€™s involvement in the war in Syria. Senior intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump on their findings on Russian election interference on Friday, before releasing a declassified report that concluded that Mr. Putin had â€œorderedâ€ a sprawling campaign intended to denigrate Hillary Clinton and aid Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agenciesâ€™ conclusions as politically motivated, but he appeared to soften that stance in a statement his transition team released after the briefing. He also seemingly conceded Russian involvement in the election, but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered, apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that it is time to â€œmove onâ€ from the focus on Russian meddling in the election, arguing that it has received such attention only because Democrats are embarrassed about their loss  â€”   an assertion he repeated on Twitter on Saturday. Late on Friday, he blamed the Democratic National Committee for the hacking of its computer systems, saying that â€œgross negligenceâ€ had allowed it to happen. Many Democrats said on Twitter that Mr. Trump was essentially engaging in  ."
